No 402 a grey street as in his opinion sushilabala as executrix to her husband s estate and her two sons had acquired title to the said premises by adverse possession and the title of the idol thereto had been extinguished.

the appeal as also the petition for special leave to appeal mentioned above came on for hearing and final disposal before us.
the petition for special leave was therefore allowed to be withdrawn and no objection now survives in regard to the decree passed by the trial court dismissing the idol s claim to the premises No 402 a.
it was contended on behalf of the appellants that the dedication of the premises.
41 grey street made by dwarka nath under the terms of his will was a partial dedication and that his sons rajendra and jogendra and his widow golap sundari who were appointed sevayats of the idol were competent to deal with premises.
No 41.
grey street after making the due provision for the idol as they purported to do by the terms of settlement dated the 24th november 1910.
it was further contended that nagendra by virtue of the award dated the 12th october 1920 claimed to be absolutely entitled to the premises.
the first contention of the appellants is clearly untenable on the very language of the will of dwarka nath.
his also i dedicate to the sheba of the said sri sri sridhar jew salagram sila thakur.
if there be any surplus left after defraying the debsheba expenses the same shall be credited to the said sridhar jew thakur s fund and with the amount so deposited repairs etc from time to time will be effected to the said house.

t is quite true that a dedication may be either absolute or partial.
the property may be given out and out to the idol or it may be subjected to a charge in favour of the idol.
the question whether the idol itself shall be considered the true beneficiary subject to a charge in favour of the heirs or specified relatives of the testator for their upkeep or that on the other hand these heirs shall be considered the true beneficiaries of the property subject to a charge for the upkeep worship and expenses of the idol is a question which can only be settled by a conspectus of the entire provisions of the will pande har narayan v surja kunwari 1921 l r 48 i a 143 145 146 1921 indlaw pc 56.
they are to be registered in the municipal records in the name of the deity the municipal bills have got to be taken also in his name and none of the testator s representatives heirs successors executors administrators or assigns is to have any manner of interest in or right to the said premises or is to be competent to give away or effect sale mortgage etc.
of the said premises.
the only thing which was urged by shri n c chatterjee in support of his contention was that the right to reside in the premises was given to the sevayats and that according to him detracted from the absolute character of the dedication.
the first contention of the appellants therefore fails and we hold that the dedication of the premises.
41 grey street to the idol was an absolute dedication.

the second contention of the appellants also therefore fails.
