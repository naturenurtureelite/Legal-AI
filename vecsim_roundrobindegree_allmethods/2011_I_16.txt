permissibility.
as stated in the narration of facts the appellant was convicted u s 7 of the act for which he was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months and to pay a fine of rs 500 in default simple imprisonment for one month.
he was also convicted for the offence under s 131dii read with s 132 of the act and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year and fine of rs 500 in default simple imprisonment for one month.
at the slp stage this court by order dated 27 07 2009issued notice confined only to the question as to whether the petitioner was guilty of commission of an offence under any of the parts of s 304 indian penal code1860 in short ipc and not u s 302 ipc similar request was made before the bench that the appellant was entitled to urge all the questions including his right to urge that he should have been acquitted in the facts and circumstances of the case.
after permitting the appellant therein to argue the case for acquittal on merits it observed we however make it clear that this can not be a universal practice in all cases.
emphasis supplied.
as a matter of fact the last sentence in para 18 makes it clear that in the facts and circumstances of that case they permitted the appellants to urge all points on merits.
he fairly admitted that out of the maximum period of one year the appellant had served only 52 days in prison.
it is not in dispute that the provisions of the prevention of corruption act1988 alone are applicable since the incident occurred on 14 11 1997 i e subsequent to the act.
as per sub s 2 if any public servant commits criminal misconduct shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall be not less than one year but which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine.
for clarity we reproduce the said section hereunder criminal misconduct by a public servant  1.
a public servant is said to commit the offence of criminal misconduct a if he habitually accepts or obtains or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain from any person for himself or for any other person any gratification other than legal remuneration as a motive or reward such as is mentioned in section 7 or b if he habitually accepts or obtains or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain for himself or for any other person any valuable thing without consideration or for a consideration which he knows to be inadequate from any person whom he knows to have been or to be or to be likely to he concerned in any proceeding or business transacted or about to be transacted by him or having any connection with the official functions of himself or of any public servant to whom he is subordinate or from any person whom he knows to be interests in or related to the person so concerned or c if he dishonestly or fraudulently misappropriates or otherwise converts for his own use any property entrusted to him or under his control as a public servant or allows any other person so to do or d if he i by corrupt or illegal means obtains for himself or for any other person any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage or ii by abusing his position as a public servant obtains for himself or for any other person any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage or iii.
explanation.
for the purposes of this section known sources of income means income received from any lawful source and such receipt has been intimated in accordance with the provisions of any law rules or orders for the time being applicable to public servant.
any public servant who commits criminal misconduct shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall be not less than one year but which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine.
however proviso to sub s 2 of s 5 gives power to the court that for any special reasons to be recorded in writing impose a sentence of imprisonment of less than one year.
finally the special judge framed charges for offence punishable under sections 712131d read with s 132 of the act.
after a gap of 14 years there is no need to retain the same sentence and the court is not justified in directing the appellant to serve the remaining period after such a long time.
accordingly we reject the said contention.
about the request based on delay that the appellant has lost his job undergone the ordeal all along etc a lenient view be taken in this case it is useful to refer decision of this court in state of m p vs.

art 142 and its applicability.
by drawing our attention to art 142 of the constitution of india learned senior counsel for the appellant vehemently submitted that in order to do complete justice this court has ample power to reduce the sentence even to the extent of period already undergone or any other order which would be beneficial to the parties approaching this court.

an order which this court can make in order to do complete justice between the parties must not only be consistent with the fundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution but it can not even be inconsistent with the substantive provisions of the relevant statutory laws.

ameerbi 2007 11 scc 681 2006.
despite an extraordinary constitutional jurisdiction contained in art 142 of the constitution of india this court ordinarily would not pass an order which would be in contravention of a statutory provision.
however it is to be made clear that this power can not be used to supplant the law applicable to the case.
emphasis added.
after elaborately discussing almost all the case laws on this subject about jurisdiction of this court under article 142summarised the same in the following words therefore the law in this regard can be summarised to the effect that in exercise of the power u art 142 of the constitution this court generally does not pass an order in contravention of or ignoring the statutory provisions nor is the power exercised merely on sympathy.
after saying so the court rejected the request of the parties to waive the statutory period of six months under the act.
art 142 of the constitution vests unfettered independent jurisdiction to pass any order in public interest to do complete justice if exercise of such jurisdiction is not be contrary to any express provision of law.
1998 indlaw sc 688this court observed the supreme court in exercise of its jurisdiction u art 142 has the power to make such order as is necessary for doing complete justice between the parties in any cause or matter pending before it.
711but the substantive statutory provisions dealing with the subject matter of a given case cannot be altogether ignored by this court while making an order u art 142 indeed these constitutional powers can not in any way be controlled by any statutory provisions but at the same time these powers are not meant to be exercised when their exercise may come directly in conflict with what has been expressly provided for in statute dealing expressly with the subject.
and may be put on a different and perhaps even wider footing than ordinary inherent powers of a court to prevent injustice.
finally learned senior counsel for the appellant has cited certain orders of this court wherein this court has reduced the period of sentence already undergone while upholding the conviction.
from the analysis of the above decisions and the concerned provisions with which we are concerned the following principles emerge a when the court issues notice confining to particular aspect sentence arguments will be heard only to that extent unless some extraordinary circumstance material is shown to the court for arguing the matter on all aspects.
an order which this court can make in order to do complete justice between the parties must not only be consistent with the fundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution but also it can not even be inconsistent with the substantive provisions of the relevant statute.
g in exercise of the power u art 142 of the constitution this court generally does not pass an order in contravention of or ignoring the statutory provisions nor is the power exercised merely on sympathy.
h the power u art 142 of the constitution is a constitutional power and not restricted by statutory enactments.
however this court would not pass any order u art 142 which would amount to supplant the substantive law applicable or ignoring statutory provisions dealing with the subject.
consequently the appeal fails and the same is dismissed.
appeal dismissed.
