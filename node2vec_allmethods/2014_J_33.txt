the other two special leave petitions are dismissed.
after hearing the learned counsel for the petitioners we are satisfied that no fault can be found with the impugned judgment of the high court so far as the setting aside of the sale is concerned.
in view of the fact that this court vide order dated 27th.
in the said case government resolution provided for payment of rental compensation expeditiously but no provision was made to pay interest in case of delayed payment.
11 it is not in dispute that in certain cases payments have already been made.
though the inevitable conclusion is that the high court is not justified in directing grant of interest on the logic of various provisions contained in the act yet there is an element of equity in favour of the landowners.
it is however seen that the writ applications were filed long after the possession was taken.
6 from 1 4 2000 till amounts payable as rental compensation are paid to the landowners concerned.
this direction shall not apply to those cases where the payments have already been made prior to 1 4 2000 appeals are allowed to the extent indicated without any stipulation of costs.
it has been ordered to refund amount in favour of the auction purchaser appellants we find no reason as to why on equitable grounds the appellants should not get interest on the said amount.
taking into consideration the aforesaid factor while working out equities it would therefore be appropriate to direct the state to pay interest at the rate of 6 on the amount to be refunded as per the high court s order with effect from 27th april2001 and 3rd.
the concerned respondents are directed accordingly.
no costs.
appeals dismissed.
