the state of manipur is in appeal before us questioning the judgment and order dated 29 07 2005 passed by a division bench of the guwahati high court in wa nos 61787995 and 100 of 1999 upholding a judgment and order of a learned single judge of the said court dated 19 02 1999 in c r nos 32410125681022 and 1023 of 1998.
one shri a j tayeng was the revenue commissioner of government of manipur.
the state of manipur had not framed any recruitment rules for appointment inter alia in the revenue department and in particular the field staff thereof.
the commissioner of revenue department was conferred with a power of being the cadre controlling authority for non ministerial post of the revenue department.
he was also to be the chairman of the departmental promotion committee for non ministerial post of the revenue department.
the commissioner allegedly made certain appointments in the posts of mandols process servers and zilladars which was not within the knowledge of the state.
the said appointments were made on temporary basis.
no record in regard to the said recruitments was maintained.

i therefore deny making of such appointments.
on the other hand md.

in view of the aforementioned stand taken by the said shri tayeng the offers of appointment issued in favour of the respondents were cancelled by an order dated 17 02 1998 a corrigendum thereto was however issued on 21 02 1998 stating no 21593 comrev.

so far as the matter relating to civil appeal arising out of slp c no 19375 19376 of 2005 is concerned it was directed that as the appointment of the respondents were made for a period of six months the employees were only entitled to the salary for the said period.
the writ appeals preferred there against by the appellants herein were dismissed.

any action which had not been taken by an authority competent therefor and in complete violation of the constitutional and legal framework would not be binding on the state.
the action of the state did not thus lack bonafide.
with a view to establish their legal rights to enable the high court to issue a writ of mandamus the respondents were obligated to establish that the appointments had been made upon following the constitutional mandate adumbrated in arts 14 and 16 of the constitution of india.
he was only a cadre controlling authority.
the government order dated 12 01 1998 did not delegate the power of appointment to the commissioner.
he therefore was wholly incompetent to issue the appointment letters.
the respondents therefore in our opinion were not entitled to hold the posts.
the said decision is not an authority for the proposition that the principles of natural justice are required to be complied with in all situations.
it was held 34 in our opinion the wide sweep of art 14 undoubtedly takes within its fold the impugned circular issued by the state of u p in exercise of its executive power irrespective of the precise nature of appointment of the government counsel in the districts and the other rights contractual or statutory which the appointees may have.
arbitrariness is the very negation of the rule of law.
this distinction between the state and a private individual in the field of contract has to be borne in the mind.
we in the facts and circumstances of this case do not see any arbitrariness on the part of the state in its action directing cancellation of appointments.
we may on the other hand notice that kumari shrilekha vidyarthi 1990 indlaw sc 463 supra has been distinguished by this court in state of u p and others v u p state law officers association and others 1994 2 scc 204 1994 indlaw sc 1289 stating the reliance placed by the respondents in this behalf on shrilekha vidyarthi v state of u p 1990 indlaw sc 463 is misplaced for the obvious reason that the decision relates to the appointment of the district government counsel and the additional assistant district government counsel who are the law officers appointed by the state government to conduct civil criminal and revenue cases in any court other than the high court.
the shortcomings in the work are required to be brought to the notice of the legal remembrancer.
the latter are not appointed as a part of the spoils system.
it has been said in jayanti prasad v state of uttar pradesh 1951 indlaw all 27 that these are technical words used in cases in which a persons services are terminated by way of punishment.
those expressions it is urged have been taken from the service rules where they were used to denote the three major punishments and it is submitted that those expressions should be read and understood in the same sense and treated as words of article in dhirender singh and others v state of haryana and others 1997 2 scc 712 1996 indlaw sc 1725termination of an order of promotion in favour of the appellant was not interfered with by this court as the same had not been approved by the dig being the competent authority.
in m c mehta v union of india and others 1999 6 scc 237 1999 indlaw sc 1396this court developed the useless formality theory stating more recently lord bingham has deprecated the useless formality theory in r v.
foulkes craig and others say that the court can not prejudge what is to be decided by the decision making authority de smith says courts have not yet committed themselves to any one view though discretion is always with the court.
wade says that while futile writs may not be issued a distinction has to be made according to the nature of the decision.
we may also state that there is yet another line of cases as in state bank of patiala v s k sharma rajendra singh v state of m p 1994 indlaw mp 48 that even in relation to statutory provisions requiring notice a distinction is to be made between cases where the provision is intended for individual benefit and where a provision is intended to protect public interest.
in the former case it can be waived while in the case of the latter it can not be waived.
if such appointment orders are a nullity the question of observance of principles of natural justice would not arise.
in bar council of india v high court of kerala 2004 6 scc 311 2004 indlaw sc 340it was stated principles of natural justice however cannot be stretched too far.
their application may be subject to the provisions of a statute or statutory rule.
in r s garg v state of u p and others 2006 6 scc 430 2006 indlaw sc 801it was stated a discretionary power as is well known can not be exercised in an arbitrary manner.
it is necessary to emphasize that the state did not proceed on the basis that the amendment to the rules was not necessary.
the action of a statutory authority as is well known must be judged on the basis of the norms set up by it and on the basis of the reasons assigned therefor.
the same can not be supplemented by fresh reasons in the shape of affidavit or otherwise.
for the reasons aforementioned the impugned judgments can not be sustained.
appeal allowed.
