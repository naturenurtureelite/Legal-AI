in the case of biswajit halder alias babu halder and others v state of w b 2008 1 scc 202 2007 indlaw sc 304the court stated the ingredients of this provision as follows 10 the basic ingredients to attract the provisions of section 304 b are as follows.
13 if.
in the case of ashok kumar v state of haryana 2010 12 scc 350 2010 indlaw sc 502this court explained these terms in some elucidation and the effect of the deeming fiction appearing in the section as follows 11 the appellant was charged with an offence under section 304 b of the code.
12 the definition of dowry under s 2 of the act reads as under 2 definition of dowry.
this court in ran singh v state of haryana2008 4 scc 700 2008 indlaw sc 120 held that the payments which are customary payments for example given at the time of birth of a child or other ceremonies as are prevalent in the society or families to the marriage would not be covered under the expression dowry.
again in satvir singh v state of punjab20018 scc 633 2001 indlaw sc 224.
this court held that the word dowry should be any property or valuable given or agreed to be given in connection with the marriage.
the definition of dowry is not restricted to agreement or demand for payment of dowry before and at the time of marriage but even include subsequent demands was the dictum of this court in state of a p v.
s 4 of the act is the penal section and demanding a dowryas defined under s 2 of the act is punishable under this section.
similar view was expressed by this court in yashoda v state of m p20043 scc 98 2004 indlaw sc 132 where this court stated that determination of the period would depend on the facts and circumstances of a given case.
thus the cruelty harassment and demand of dowry should not be so ancient whereafter the couple and the family members have lived happily and that it would result in abuse of the said protection.
the court can not ignore one of the cardinal principles of criminal jurisprudence that a suspect in the indian law is entitled to the protection of art 20 of the constitution of india as well as has a presumption of innocence in his favour.
such a presumption can be drawn by the court keeping in view the evidence produced by the prosecution in support of the substantive charge under section 304 b of the code.
it is for the accused to show that the death of the deceased did not result from any cruelty or demand of dowry by the accused persons.
maintaining silence can not be equated to discharge of onus by the accused.
in the present case the prosecution by reliable and cogent evidence has established the guilt of the accused.
the high court acquitted pathan khadar basha the fatherin law of the deceased as there was no direct evidence against him.
accused pathan hussain basha and pathan nazeer abi have rightly been found guilty of the offence by the courts.
