Appeal No 1375 of 1966.
It is so decided by the majority.
 The Company thereupon filed an appeal before the Standing Committee Zila Parishad Nagpur hereinafter referred to as the Standing Committee on October 22 1963.
The learned counsel for the appellant contends before us 1 that r 5 of the Fees Rules was intraviress 2 that the Standing Committee had no jurisdiction to decide the appeal on merits as the appeal to the Panchayat Samiti was barred by limitation 3 that the octroi duty has been levied in accordance with law 4 that at any rate the levy was good after the octroi limits were fixed on January 14 1964 5 that the approval of the octroi limits on January 14 1964 relates back to April 1 1963 and 6 that the tea was imported into the Panchayat limits for consumption use or sale.
Before we deal with these points it is necessary to set out the relevant statutory provisions.
Procedure for levying tax or fee.
It would be noticed that the rule which authorises the levy is r22 but it enjoins that the procedure prescribed in rr3 and 4 should be followed before the octroi duty can be levied.
Rule 7 which deals with tax on buildings and lands also prescribes that the panchayat shall follow the procedure prescribed in rr3 and 4 before levying a tax on buildings and lands.
It only deals with two items 1 selection of the tax and the rate at which it is to be levied.
We are unable to allow him to raise this point at this stage.
Rule 5 follows imme diately rr3 and 4 and is headed Appeal against levy of any tax or fee and the period of sixty days of limitation commences from the date of the publication of the notice under r4 ie the notice following the decision of a Panchayat to levy any tax or fee.
