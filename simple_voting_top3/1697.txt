The present appeals are from the judgment of the High Court.
Now the first condition of the applicability of sub sec.
3 and 4 of section 25.
It contends that it had been carrying on a business on April 1 1939 from before and on that business tax had been charged under the Act of 1918 and that it was succeeded by a company as owner of the business as a result of a transfer by an instrument executed on February 7 1948.
20 All the partners hereby agree that they in their individual capacity are and shall be Partners also along with Hemchand Veerjee Sait in a Partnership business in Soaps and Umbrellas carried on in Calicut and Madras under the name and style of Sait Nagjee Purushotham and Co Soap and Umbrella Merchants and in Bombay under the name and style of Shah Nagjee Purushotham  Co the terms and conditions whereof are embodied in an Agreement of Partnership dated 30 5 1939 signed by all the Partners.
This is clear from the terms of the instrument which we have earlier set out.
There is no reference in annexure C I to the firm constituted by the instrument of December 6 1918.
The word firm in annexure C I refers to the partnership brought into existence by it.
 Now when the business on which tax was charged under the Act of 1918 which it is not disputed happened in this case was discontinued in 1937 it could not have been carried on April 1 1939.
That being so there can be no question of the succession to the business carried on at the commencement of the Indian Income tax Amendment Act 1939 that is April 1 1939 and on which tax was charged under the Act of 1918 having taken place in 1948 as claimed by the appellant.
On May 30 1939 two 110 deeds were executed.
C2 was executed by Nagjee Narayanjee and Manecklal.
The firm name shall be Sait Nagjee Purushotham  Co Bankers Piece goods Yarn Soap and Umbrella merchants.
We are not concerned with these sub sections.
