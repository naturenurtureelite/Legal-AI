Appeals Nos 884 887 of 1962.
268 of 1954 203 of 1955 4 of 1954 and 27 of 1954.
March 12 1964.
The suit out of which appeal No 887 has arisen was filed by the respondent against the State of Rajasthan.
By May 15 1949 the United State of Rajasthan was formed including the Matsya Union into which the former State of Dholpur had merged on March 17 1948.
Provision was also made in the Covenant that all the assets and liabilities of the covenanting States shall be the assets and liabilities of the new State of Matsya.
Thereupon there was a reference to a Full Bench on the question of liability which was formulated by the learned Judges thus Whether the expression Government of the corresponding State  used in article 2952 of the Constitution with reference to Rajasthan properly means the Government of the United State of Rajasthan which was the only Indian State in existence at the time of the commencement of the Constitution or it also includes the Government of any of the Covenanting States which had integrated with the United State before the Constitution came into operation.
The three second appeals were dismissed by the High Court.
In consequence this Court further held that the Covenant by which the new State of Pepsu came into existence was in its entirety an act of State and that article VI therein could not operate to confer any right on the company as against the new State for the principle was well settled that clauses in treaties entered into by sovereigns of independent States whereunder sovereignty in territories passed from one to the other providing for the recognition by the new sovereign of the existing rights of the residents of those territories must be regarded as invested with the character of an act of State and no claim based thereon could be enforced in a court of law.
