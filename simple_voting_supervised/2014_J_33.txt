for determination of the issue involved in c a nos 6169 6171 of 2013 and c a nos 6172 6174 of 2013it is desirable to refer the relevant factual matrix of the case which is as follows.
the proprietors of respondent company namely m s jaswant sugar mills ltd had six business units as under m s.
jaswant sugar mills.
meerut straw board mills.
northern india paper mills.
bindal vanaspati ghee mills.
meduwala open pan sugar bijnor.
the company was in heavy arrears as on 3rd january1977 to the extent of rs 1 14 crores.
accordingly the district collector meerut appointed a receiver under section 286 a of u p zamindari abolition and land reforms acthereinafter referred to as the zamindari abolition act.
subsequently the company was acquired by the state on 28th october1984.
as per provisions of the u p state sugar undertakings acquisition act1971 hereinafter referred to as the acquisition act1971as amended in the year 1984free from all encumbrances and the said unit was vested with the u p state sugar corporation hereinafter referred to as the corporation.
since the company was in arrears to the extent of rs 1 29 crores the district collector meerut by order dated 28th november1984attached all the remaining five constituent units except the sugar mill.
the general manger of the aforesaid sugar unit was appointed as a receiver with reference to all the aforesaid remaining five units.
in between 1977 to 1984for smooth functioning of the sugar mill payment of dues to sugarcane grower repairing of machinery etc.
on the request of the receiver the state government granted loan of rs 6 13 crores to the company and was to be recovered as the arrears of land revenue along with interest.
the district collector meerut taking into consideration the dues to the extent of rs 1 62 crores as on 24th october1990 were to be paid by the company extended the tenure of the receiver till further orders.
the order of the extension of tenure of the receiver was challenged by the ex proprietors of the company in a writ petition no 184961991 subsequently the receiver was withdrawn on 18th december1995therefore the writ petition was also withdrawn.
pursuant to uttar pradesh imposition of ceiling of land holdings act hereinafter referred to as the ceiling actland admeasuring 723 3 bigha belonging to the company was declared surplus.
during the pendency of the aforesaid writ petition the state government issued a notification dated 14th august1987 u s 4 read with s 174 of the land acquisition act1894 for the meerut development authority.
it was followed by a notification dated 4th september1987 issued u s 6 of the acquisition act.
in the said case compensation amount of rs 4 33 crores was awarded by special land acquisition officer vide award dated 22nd february1990.
the district collector meerut pursuant to a report of the tehsildar ordered to pay the compensation amount after adjustment of different dues payable by the company 11 pursuant to a court s order the district collector meerut passed a speaking order dated 20th february1992 showing the details of adjustments to be made out of compensation amount of rs 4 34 crores payable by the company as detailed below.
the state government filed the deduction statement for recovery of the dues before the prescribed authority constituted under u p sugar undertaking acquisition act1971 however the aforesaid claim was rejected by the prescribed authority by order dated 4th october1994 in claim no 13 of 1999.
against the said order dated 4th october1994 passed by the prescribed authority the appellant filed appeal no 195 before the appellate tribunal.
hence the appointment of receiver was terminated with immediate effect.
against the interim order the appellant state filed the special appeals.
it was ordered to dispose of the writ petition expeditiously.
with direction to the appellant to pay the compensation amount to the company.
the grievance of the appellant state is that the high court while passing the impugned order has not noticed the liability incurred by the undertaking and the loan paid to the company.
it is not in dispute that the company was under heavy arrears as on 3rd january1977 therefore the district collector meerut appointed the receiver.
the high court though noticed that s 8 of the u p state sugar undertakings acquisition act1971 empowers the prescribed authority to decide any dispute regarding the amount payable to any person or authority in respect of earlier liabilities of the undertaking but it wrongly held that in view of the provisions of the u p sugar undertakings acquisition act1971.
it is always open to the competent authority to seek recovery of the amount if due from the company or to adjust the dues.
the collector tulsi gaur was not a party by name.
the order dated 20th february1992 passed by the collector was also not under challenge inspite of the same the high court declared the order dated 20th february1992 as illegal.
the same is accordingly set aside.
on the other hand if any amount is found payable by the company the competent authority may recover the amount in accordance with law.
for determination of the issue involved in c a nos 7122 of 20037123 7124 of 20037125 of 2003 and 7126 7129 of 2003 relevant factual matrix of the case is as follows.
ltd being aggrieved by the said judgment preferred review application under order xlvii rule 1 cpc for review of the judgment and order dated 27th april2001 passed by the high court.
another application was filed by m s ltd under order xivii rule 1 cpc for review of the order dated 3rd september2001 the said review application was dismissed by the impugned judgment dated 15th march2002.

in a situation like in the present case one can not hold of any statute entitling the auction purchasers to claim interest in case the auction got cancelled or set aside by the court of law.
counsel for the parties also could not refer any of the clauses of auction prescribing interest on refund of amount in case of cancellation of auction or sale.
the question arises as to whether in such a situation an auction purchaser can claim interest on equitable ground.
in state of maharashtra and others vs maimuma banu and others2003 7 scc 448 2003 indlaw sc 625the question arose as to whether interest was payable on rental compensation.
in the said case government resolution provided for payment of rental compensation expeditiously but no provision was made to pay interest in case of delayed payment.
this court in the said case held 10 the crucial question is whether there can be any direction for interest on rental compensation once it is held that the same has to be paid within the time frame notwithstanding the fact that there is no statutory obligation.
11 it is not in dispute that in certain cases payments have already been made.
though the inevitable conclusion is that the high court is not justified in directing grant of interest on the logic of various provisions contained in the act yet there is an element of equity in favour of the landowners.
it is however seen that the writ applications were filed long after the possession was taken.
this factor can not be lost sight of while working out the equities.
it would therefore be appropriate if the appellants pay interest.
6 from 1 4 2000 till amounts payable as rental compensation are paid to the landowners concerned.
in the present case we find that there was no mis representation on the part of the auction purchasers they deposited the total auction amount within the time stipulated.
it has not been in dispute that the title of the land was also transferred in their favour.
but for the reasons mentioned by the high court the sale has been cancelled.
it has been ordered to refund amount in favour of the auction purchaser appellants we find no reason as to why on equitable grounds the appellants should not get interest on the said amount.
taking into consideration the aforesaid factor while working out equities it would therefore be appropriate to direct the state to pay interest at the rate of 6 on the amount to be refunded as per the high court s order with effect from 27th april2001 and 3rd.
september2001the day the high court passed the impugned order.
the concerned respondents are directed accordingly.
c a nos 6169 6171 of 2013c a nos 6172 6174 of 2013c a no 7122 of 2003c a nos 7123 7124 of 2003c a no 7125 of 2003 are allowed in terms of the directions as above.
the appeals c a nos 7126 7129 of 2003 filed by the commissioner meerut are dismissed.
