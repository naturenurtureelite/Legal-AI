the main question raised in this appeal by special leave at the instance of state of gujarat and the collector of sabarkantha against the gujarat high court 's judgment and order dated january 30311975 allowing the writ petition of the respondent is whether once the competent authority under s 24 i of the bombay merged territories and areas jagirs abolition.
no xxxix of 1954 declares that a particular jagir is a proprietary one a further inquiry under s 37 2 of the bombay land revenue code bombay act.
No v of 1879 with a view to determining whether the jagirdar had any rights to mines or mineral products in his jagir granted or recognised under any contract grant or law for the time being in force or by custom or usage is competent.
the general question is whether once the competent authority under s 2 4 i of the act declares that the particular jagir is a proprietary one a further inquiry under s 372 of the land revenue code with a view to determining whether the jagirdar had rights to mines and mineral products in such jagir subsisting on the appointed date is competent.
the other specific question is whether in the facts of the case and having regard to the nature of evidence considered and the specific finding made by the competent authority while determining the question under s 24.
ithe further inquiry initiated by the collector under s 372 was misconceived and uncalled for.
the facts giving rise to the said question are these by hajur order no 116 dated october 271933the respondent maharaj shri amar singji himatsingji was granted daljitgarh jagir comprising of 10 villages mentioned in the said order in jivarak for maintenance by the then ruler of idar by another hajur order no 807 dated january 121934the respondent was given a further grant in jivarak of 3 villages mentioned in that order with effect from october 11933 by yet another hajur order no 964 dated november 21194714 villages including kapoda and isarwada were granted in jivarak to the respondent by the ruler of idar in substitution of the villages mentioned in the previous two orders.
according to the respondent by these grants parvanas read together he was given full proprietary rights in the soil of the said villages that is to say it was a proprietary jagir that was granted to him by the then ruler.
admittedly on the coming into force of the bombay merged territories and areas jagirs abolition act1953 hereinafter referred to as the act i e with effect from respondent 's daljitgarh jagir stood abolished and all his rights in the jagir villages save as expressly provided by or under the act were extinguished and the respondent became entitled to compensation under s 11 of the act.
aggrieved by this order passed by the collector on february 231973the respondent preferred a writ petition special civil application no 1224 of 1973 under art 227 of the constitution to the gujarat high court and writ of certiorari quashing the order dated february 231973 and a direction restraining the collector from further proceeding with the inquiry under s 372 of the land revenue code were sought.
the appellants seek to challenge the said judgment and order of the gujarat high court in this appeal.
according to learned counsel the mere circumstance that the respondent 's jagir was found under s 24.
on the other hand learned counsel for the respondent contended that a determination under s 2 4 i of the act that a particular jagir was a proprietary one necessarily implied that the grant was of soil and the grantee was entitled to mines and mineral products which were expressly saved under s 10 of the act and in any event on the facts obtaining in the instant case the competent authority acting under s 2 4 i of the act while coming to the conclusion that the respondent 's jagir was proprietary one bad relied upon the unqualified nature of the grant and also considered the evidence led before it touching upon the several rights such as right to sell fire wood babul trees saltrees timru trees right to sell agriculture land and house sites right to sell stones and gravel right to sell or allow use of land for manufacture of bricks enjoyed by the respondent since the time the grant had been made in his favour by the then ruler and it was on the basis of such evidence that tile competent authority had come to the conclusion that the respondent 's jagir was a proprietary one.
he further urged that the two letters addressed by the respondent one to the collector on october 111968 and the other to the mamlatdar on october 41971merely contained a request to make appropriate entries in the revenue records based on the mamlatdar 's order dated november 241959 and therefore the collector could not pronounce upon those letters as containing a claim put forward by the respondent for the first time to mines and mineral products in the said jagir villages to initiate an inquiry under s 372 of the bombay land revenue de.
he therefore urged that the high court was right in quashing the collector 's order dated february 231973.
dealing with the first question which is of a general character it is clear that the answer thereto depends upon the true scope and ambit of the inquiry under s 2 4 i of the act and to determine the same it will be necessary to consider the scheme and object of the act and in particular the purpose of the said inquiry.
the aforesaid survey of the material provisions of the act will bring out two or three aspects very clearly.
in the first place the preamble and s 3 of the act clearly show that the object of the enactment is to abolish jagirs of all kinds in the merged territories and merged areas in the state of bombay and to convert all jagir villages into unalienated villages liable to the payment of land revenue in accordance with the provisions of the bombay land revenue code.
secondly compensation is made payable under s 11 of the act to jagirdars whose jagirs and other incidental rights have been extinguished but it will be pertinent to note that no provision has been made for payment of compensation in respect of rights to mines and mineral products in a jagir village obviously because if by the grant in question the jagirdar has not been given any rights to mines and mineral products no compensation would be payable and if there be a grant of mines and mineral products the same have been saved to the jagirdar under s 10 of the act.
there is yet one more aspect emerging from the definition of the expression proprietary jagir which leads to the same inference.
it is therefore not possible to accept the contention of learned counsel for the respondents that a determination under s 2 4 i of the act to the effect that a particular jagir is a proprietary one necessarily implies that the grantee is entitled to mines and mineral products in the villages comprised in the grant especially when having regard to the definition given in s 2xviii a jagir could be proprietary without a right to mines and mineral products.
i of the act a further inquiry under s 372 of the bombay land revenue code into the question whether a jagirdar had any subsisting rights to mines and mineral products in the jagir villages on the appointed date would be competent unless the grant of a right to mines and mineral products or the actual enjoyment thereof in keeping with the grant happens to be the basis of the determination under s 2 4 1 of the act.
the main valid objection to the said inquiry is that the condition precedent the existence of which canlead to the initiation of such inquiry is absent here.
that being the position there was no occasion for the collector to initiate the inquiry under s 372 of the code in fact he had no jurisdiction to do so the condition precedent not being satisfied.
besides while determining the proprietary nature of the grant under s 241 of the act the competent authority had on evidence led before it alluded among others to the respondent 's right to excavate and sell gravel and stones and enjoyment thereof by the respondent.
in this view of the matter we feel that the high court was right in its final conclusion whereby it has quashed the inquiry initiated by the collecor under s 372 of the code and issued the necessary injunction prayed for by the respondent.
s 2vii defines jagirdar as meaning a holder of a jagir village and includes his co sharer.
i whether a jagir is proprietary or non proprietary iiwhether any land is ghatked or jiwai or iiiwhetherany person is a permanent holder.
provided that the state government may authorise any officer to decide questions arising under any of the subclausesiii and iii and subject to an appeal to the state government his decision shall be final.
section 3which contains the main provision dealing with abolition of jagirs provides that notwithstanding anything contained in any usage grant sanad order agreement or any law for the time being in force on and from the appointed date which under s 2 1 i is a date on which the act comes into force which is august 11954all jagirs shall be deemed to have been abolished and save as expressly provided by or under the provisions of this act the right of a jagirdar to recover rent or assessment of land or to levy or recover any kind of tax cess fee charge or any hak and the right of reversion or lapse if any vested in a jagirdar and all other rights of a jagirdar or of any person legally subsisting on the said date in respect of a jagir village as incidents of jagir shall be deemed to have been extinguished.
s 8 declares that all public roads lands paths bridges titches dikes and fences on or besides the same the bed of the sea and of harbours creeks below high water mark and of rivers streams nalaps lakes wells and tanks and all canals and water courses etc situated in jagir village shall vest in the state government and shall be deemed to be the property of the state government and all rights held by such jagirdars in such property shall be deemed to have been extinguished s 10 contains an express saving provision relating to rights to mines and mineral products and it provides that nothing in this act or any other law for the time being in force shall be deemed to affect the rights of any jagirdar subsisting on the appointed date to mines or mineral products in a jagir village granted or recognised under any contract.
ss 13 and 14 provide for methods of awarding compensations to jagirdars by the collector and against the awards of the collector under either of these provisions a appeal has been provided at the instance of the aggrieved party to the revenue tribunal under s 16 s 17 provides the procedure for disposal of appeals by the revenue tribunal while s 18 prescribes a period of limitation for preferring such appeals and s 20 gives finality to the award made by the collector subject to appeal to the revenue tribunal.
the rest of the sections are if formal character and not material for our purposes.
under sub s 3the decision of the collector under sub s 2 is rendered final subject to the result of a suit that is required to be instituted in a civil court within one year of the said.
the appeal is therefore dismissed with costs.
