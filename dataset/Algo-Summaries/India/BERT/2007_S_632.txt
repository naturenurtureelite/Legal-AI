a r khan secretary revenue has made many appointments of mandols process servers zilladars in the recent months against which i have been complaining that the secretary revenue has no power or authority to make any appointments of field staff as per rules provided under m l r act1960 in this regard i have apprised the matter to the honourable minister revenue already and also informed the chief secretary manipur explaining that the secretary revenue can not make such appointments of field staffs even if he wanted to do so all the relevant files should have been routed through the undersigned so that the same may be brought to the notice of the honourable minister revenue his action has created lots of misunderstanding and confusion
on the other hand md
he has been making false and wrong allegations against the commissioner revenue and putting him false position
it is for this reason i have been writing to all the deputy commissioners in the districts even by sending w t messages clarifying the actual position of making any appointment of revenue field staff
i therefore deny making of such appointments
i still deny that i have made any appointment of field staffs of revenue department during the recent months

in view of the aforementioned stand taken by the said shri tayeng the offers of appointment issued in favour of the respondents were cancelled by an order dated 17 02 1998 a corrigendum thereto was however issued on 21 02 1998 stating no 21593 comrev

an inquiry was therefore made to find out the authority which had issued the said offers of appointments
with reference to the u o letter no 21593 comr pt
the state of manipur had not framed any recruitment rules for appointment inter alia in the revenue department and in particular the field staff thereof
shri tayeng by a uo note dated 12 01 1998 denied to have made such an appointment stating confidential u o no 21593 com r pt
the appointing authority in absence of any delegation of power having been made in that behalf was the state government

a detailed and emphatic criticism of the useless formality theory has been made much earlier in natural justice substance or shadow by prof d h clark of canada 1975 pl27 63 contending that malloch and glynn were wrongly decided
it appears that the appointment orders were issued after complying the formalities prescribed there for which can be ascertained from the relevant official file
the said decision is not an authority for the proposition that the principles of natural justice are required to be complied with in all situations
