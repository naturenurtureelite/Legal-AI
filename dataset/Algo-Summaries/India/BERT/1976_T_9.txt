there are a few other s s in chapter vi which deal with payment of compensation
section 28 states how the amount of compensation is to be determined and the methodology of payment
the act also provides for appeal second appeal and revision the last being to the high court and the earlier ones being to the collector and a board constituted under section 22
the rule making power is vested in the government under section 47 and there is a routine removal of difficulties clause contained in section 50
section 26 has great relevance as it lays down the method of arriving at the gross asset and section 27 has like significance as it focuses on the manner in which the net income from an estate shall be computed by deducting certain items from the gross asset of the estate
these furnish in bare outline the provisions with which we are directly concerned
of course when there is joint ownership section 24 stipulates that the compensation shall be determined for the estate as a whole and not separately for each of the shares therein
against the background of law just projected we may set out shri purohit s points which if we may say so are substantially the same as have been argued by him in revision before the high court with partial success
for convenience of reference we may extract the statement by the high court of the contentions urged before it and repeated before us by the appellant
the provisions of section 373 read with section 262
three civil appeals stemming from three revision petitions to the high court of orissa under the orissa estates abolition act 1951 orissa act i of 1952 for short the act have reached this court thanks to special leave granted to the appellant who is common in all the cases
if we may anticipate ourselves none of the nine submissions has appealed to us save to the extent the high court has upheld
we have listened with patience to all his submissions good bad and indifferent
a compensation assessment roll containing the gross asset and net income of each estate together with the compensation payable in respect of such estate has to be prepared by him
where the actual income is to be included in the gross assets in the case of forests the assumed income and not the actual income is to be included
even so a minimal narration of the facts and a brief consideration of each argument is necessary and we proceed to do so
the high court after deciding various issues remanded the cases to the compensation officer under the act after over ruling most of the contentions pressed before it by the appellant
b v of the act make it clear that the date of vesting is the last date by which the calculation of compensation should have been made
he has argued in person and with passion
during the agricultural year immediately preceding the abolition the petitioners had not actually derived any income from the forests and as such they were under no obligation to pay any income tax on such income
6 unlike in case of fisheries etc
the compensation officer is charged with fixing the quantum in the prescribed manner
while his arguments did not impress us we were touched by his concluding words that he had been born and had grown in an adivasi village in the only brahmin family and in his evening years of life proposed to give a substantial part of the compensation the state would give him for adivasi welfare
we are directly concerned with the issue of compensation which is dealt with as earlier stated in chapter v of the act
shri achutananda purohit appellant was the intermediary in respect of vast forests and other lands comprised in the estate of jujumura in the district of sambalpur
although he waxed sentimentally on this note he did not convince us on his contentions
the power to approve implies the power to disapprove or modify but not to report or arrive at an income de hors the forest officer s report altogether
with these prefatory observations we proceed to formulate the many points urged and give our findings and reasons one after the other
shri purohit appellant is an advocate by profession and is 83 years old
the report of the chief conservator of forests is also invalid because of the fact that the appraisement is made only with reference to the area of the disputed forests without taking into consideration the density of growth therein
the section is clear that the gross income from forests must be calculated on the basis of appraisal of the annual yield on the date of vesting firstly by a forest officer and secondly by the chief conservator of forests screening it and approving it
the integrated process has already been explained by us and will be followed in the proceedings to ensue on remand
certainly the chief conservator can not be ignored by the compensation officer nor can the chief conservator ignore the assessment made by the forest officer and go through an independent exercise
therefore deduction of income tax from the gross assets is illegal and unwarranted
the said order the relevant portion of which we are concerned runs thus he would immediately call upon the divisional forest officer to make appraisement within three months from the receipt of the record
with these directions and observations we affirm the orders under appeal but while dismissing the appeals direct the parties to bear their costs in this court
as admittedly compensation had not been calculated by the date of vesting the compensation officer lost his statutory jurisdiction to do so
and this holds good after the second remand order that the forest officer will do the appraisement of the annual income forward his report to the chief conservator of forests who will take the said report into consideration and if necessary make modifications therein or approve it with such changes as he deems fit
this estate vested in the state on april 1 1960 by force of the act and the crucial question agitated before us consequentially turns on the quantum of compensation awardable under chapter v of the act
