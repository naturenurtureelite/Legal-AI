the vesco had no managing director but at each meeting of its board of directors one of the directors used to be elected chairman
the vesco had its own board of directors while the aeco had also its own separate board of directors
the same practice was followed at the meeting of the general body of the shareholders
the aeco on the other band always had a managing director first of whom was d l n raju
a mention may be made of the fact that in june 1952 the vesco undertaking was acquired by the government under the provisions of the electricity undertaking acquisition act but nothing turns on it
he died in the year 1939 and was succeeded by r k n g raju an advocate of rajahmundry
the original managing agency agreement in favour of aeco with respect to vesco was for a period of 15 years i e from 1933 to 1948 and was later renewed for the remaining term of the currency of the licence granted by the government under the electricity act
this person however did not shift to visakhapatnam on his becoming the managing director but continued to stay most of the time at rajahmundry
according to the prosecution both these concerns were running smoothly and efficiently during the lifetime of d l n raju because he was personally attending to their affairs
his successor however apart from the fact that be continued to be staying mostly at rajahmundry was also interested in several other ventures including a sugar factory at dewas in central india
i was tried before the court of sessions visakhapatnam for offences under section 120 b indian penal code section 409 section 477 a and section 471 read with section 467 i p c while respondent no 2 was tried for an offence under section 120 b and for offences under sections 409 read with section 109 477 a and 471 read with section 467 i p c each of the respondents was convicted of the first two offences but
the prosecution case in so far as it is material for the decision of this appeal is as follows
the state of andhra pradesh has come up before this court in appeal by obtaining special leave under article 136 of the constitution
rajahmurthy were started apparently by raju himself and the aeco was appointed the managing agent of each of these concerns
the knowledge of the financial position of vesco obtained by them used to be derived essentially from the respondent no 1
in the year 1929 the andhra engineering co which was originally a partnership firm formed by one d l n raju was converted into a private limited company with its headquarters at visakhapatnam
the respondent no i alone was convicted of the other two offences
mr bhimasankaram supports the reason given by the high court for coming to the conclusion that there was a misjoinder of charges
eventually many of those ventures failed
the high court allowed the two appeals acquitted the respondents and dismissed the application for revision preferred by the state
as secretary of vesco it was his duty to convene the meetings of the board of directors to present before them the periodical statement of receipts and expenditure of vesco to convene meetings of the general body to prepare the managing agents report and the director s report as also to see to the presentation of auditors report and the statement of accounts
the accounts maintained by the vesco used to be explained by him not only to the directors but also to the shareholders
some time later other industrial concerns the andhra cements ltd vi jayawada and the east coast ceremics
we shall refer to this company throughout as the aeco
the aeco was appointed managing agent for each of these corporations under separate agreements
various sentences were passed against them by the additional sessions judge visakhapatnam who presided over the court
it obtained licences from the government under the electricity act for supply of electrical energy to visakhapatnam anakapalli and some other places
amounts which were misappropriated used to find their way in this account
as the aeco did not have the necessary capital to undertake the work raju floated in the year 1933 a public limited company called visakhapatnam electric supply corporation ltd and another in the year 1936 called the anakapalli electric supply corporation ltd the aeco transferred its licences for the supply of electrical energy to the consumers of visakhapatnam to vesco and similarly transferred to aeco the licence to supply electrical energy to consumers at anakapalli
p c for the enhancement of the sentences passed on the respondents
a new cash book was also said to have been prepared by the conspirators with the object of covering up the misappropriations which had been made
his dual capacity enabled the respondent no i to earn the confidence not only of the directors of aeco but also of those of vesco
on the face of it this is a valid charge
but certain objections have been taken to it with which we will deal at the appropriate place
mr bhimasankaram appearing for the two respondents however has not sought to support the judgment of the high court on all these points
finally the high court held that the examination of the respondent under section 342 of the code was unfair for a number of reasons and that the additional sessions judge had failed to perform an important duty in that he did not call the attention of the respondents to the provisions of section 342 which enable an accused person to give evidence in his own behalf
the explanations of the managing agents and the directors of vesco with respect to the items mentioned in the orders of the board used also to be placed by him before the shareholders
in january 1952 he therefore brought one section g krishna aiyar who had vast experience in the maintenance of accounts of electrical undertaking s having been chief accountant of the south madras electric supply corporation to undertake an investigation and then to act as financial adviser
the first charge is in respect of the conspiracy alleged to have been entered into by the two respondents k v ramana the approver and others known and unknown to commit criminal breach of trust of the funds of vesco and in order to screen its detection to falsify the accounts of vesco and to use forged documents as genuine
according to the prosecution the second raju was not bestowing sufficient care and attention on the affairs of vesco
the high court has further stated that inadmissible evidence was taken on record by the additional sessions judge namely account books of billimoria brothers maintained in gujrati and further that the additional sessions judge was in error in allowing the prosecution to use those account books for establishing absence of entries with regard to certain payments alleged in the vesco books to have been made to them
the respondents preferred appeals before the high court challenging their convictions and sentences
the second charge is for an offence of criminal breach of trust punishable under section 409 and the accusation therein is that the two respondents along with ramana misappropriated 69 items aggregating to a little over rs 3 20 000
a lakh of rupees passed through that account
in the meantime on november 29 1951 there was a meeting of the general body at which the accounts were among other things to be considered
the state on the other hand preferred an application for revision under section 439 cr
the points which he urged are briefly these 1 that there was a misjoinder of charges and persons in that the various provisions of section 239 were clubbed together and an omnibus charge of conspiracy was framed which on its face was one likely to embarrass the respondents and make their task of defending themselves difficult
the high court has also held that his evidence is unreliable and further that the additional sessions judge was in error in allowing him to refresh his memory by referring to various documents in a manner not permitted by section 159 of the evidence act
he was thus all important with respect to the every day affairs of vesco
subba raju was not satisfied with the nature of supervision exercised by c section raju over the affairs of vesco because he used to look only at the cash book entries of the days on which he paid visits to vesco s office to which he used to go with previous intimation
he however was unable to obtain any information
it is clear from the charge that some of the amounts were misappropriated between april 1947 and march 1950 some between april 1947 and march 1949 some between april 1947 and march 1951 and quite a large number between september 1947 and march 1950 and a still large number between april 1951 and march 1952
the approver s evidence was held by the high court to be inadmissible because the pardon granted to him was illegal
he agreed and was elected managing director of aeco in the middle of 1948
ramana forged six documents on different dates between march 28 1949 and november 12 1951 and thus committed an offence under section 471 read with section 467 i p c as we have pointed out earlier the respondent no i alone was convicted by the additional sessions judge in respect of the third and fourth charges
the first question for consideration is whether there was a misjoinder of parties and of persons
the respondent no 1 even after his appointment on two posts connected with vesco continued to work with the aeco also whose business had by then been confined only to that of managing agents of the four companies floated by d l n raju
it is the prosecution case that as secretary of vesco and the resident representative of the managing agents the respondent no i was attending to the day to day affairs of vesco which included the receiving of all sums of money due to vesco spending money for the purpose of vesco attending to the appointment supervision and control of the staff of vesco purchasing materials required for the purpose of vesco and supervising over the accounts of vesco
he was also told that apart from signing important papers which may be sent to him by the respondent no i from time to time to manchili or wherever be might be would have no work to do
all this is not disputed
in fact in april 1952 the collector attached vesco properties for realising this amount
on april 30 1952 the respondent no 1 by selling some of his property himself paid rs 50 000 to the andhra power system towards the sum due to it from vesco and had promised to pay the balance shortly thereafter
in so far as the respondent no 2 is concerned the high court has held that since he was charged with a specific offence under s 409 i p c he could not be convicted of mere abetment of an offence
further scrutiny of the accounts was being carried out by krishna aiyar and in his subsequent report he pointed out that rs 2 38 000 which were shown as having been paid to the andhra power system had actually not been paid
he was given time for doing so but he failed to pay it
it is thus apparent that offences committed within a space of 12 months were tried along with offences committed beyond that period
on february 12 1952 the respondent no i wrote to the managing director admitting his responsibility and agreed to make good the amounts found short or such other amounts as would be found short up to the end of march 1952
the procedure adopted in the investiga tion and committal stages was irregular
upon this understanding he accepted the position offered to him
charge of conspiracy according to the high court can be validly made only when the prosecution establishes that every conspirator expected to receive a personal benefit from it and that the prosecution has not been able to establish that the respondent no 2 or the approver evidently had any such expectations since they did not in fact receive any corresponding benefit
subbaramayya took his work seriously and called for information on a number of points from the respondent no 1
he pressed his claim for appointment as secretary of vesco and representative of the managing agents at visakhapatnam and r h g raju appointed him to that post
besides that c section raju s management of andhra cements had landed it into a loss of rs 30 000
there was a considerable uproar at that meeting because the respondent no 1 said that the auditor s report had not been received
r k n g raju took till towards the end of 1947 and died at madras in april 1948
according to the prosecution the respondent no i wanted to take advantage of this fact and conceived of a scheme for misappropriating as much money belonging to vesco as possible before the managing agency agreement of aeco came to an end in october 1948
the directors of vesco thereafter authorised k section dutt one of the directors to lodge a complaint with the police which he accordingly lodged on may 19 1952
the interim report showed that there was a shortage of about rs 90 000 for this period
he was assured that by consenting to become the managing director be would not be required to discharge onerous duties and that the respondent no i would look to all the affairs of vesco
further according to the high court where a conspiracy has yielded its fruits the conspirators can be charged with the actual offences committed and not with conspiracy to commit those offences
it was also his duty to have the accounts of vesco audited by the auditors elected by the general body and to produce before the auditors the relevant accounts vouchers bank statements and so on
the aeco as managing agents of vesco had appointed in the year 1939 one d v appala raju a trusted employee as its representative and as the secretary of vesco
because of all these things he had c section raju replaced towards the end of the year 1951 by one subbaramayya a retired finance officer from the madras electricity board both as a director of andhra cements and as a supervisor over the accounts of vesco
apparently subba raju was fully satisfied with this and other explanations and therefore he appointed one c section raju who was the manager of andhra cements to supervise over the affairs of vesco apparently because of this a new method of misappropriation was adopted by the respondents by starting in the vesco account books an account called suspense account
i secured the promotion of the approver k v ramana who was originally accounts clerk to the post of senior accountant
of which the respondent no i was a director
unless therefore the provisions of section 239 are applicable it would follow that there was a misjoinder of charges
the respondent no 1 on being asked to explain said that he would give his explanation to the managing director
therefore they could not be jointly tried
we shall deal with mr bhimasankaram s contentions in the order in which we have set them out
on the next day the police placed an armed guard around the office of the respondent no i and seized a number of papers
similarly k v gopala raju was transferred from the post of stores clerk to the general department and k s n murty the discharged accused was appointed stores clerk in his place
ramana made false entries on seven different dates in the account books between september 19 1947 and march 18 1952 and thus committed an offence under section 477 a i p c the fourth charge is that the two respondents along with the approver
ganeswara rao was also an old employee of aeco having been appointed a stenotypist in the year 1923 on an initial salary of rs p m eventually he became the head clerk therein
section 409 and section 471467 are of different kinds and are not capable of joint commission
it is said that this person has not received much education and knows only bow to sign his name in english
then according to the high court offences under
the vesco used to receive large amounts of money from high tension power consumers such as the railways k g hospital the port administration the andhra university etc
i opened four personal accounts in different banks including the imperial bank of india
the third charge is that the two respondents along with the approver
later however murty was also got transferred to the general section and replaced by p w 18
this person was auditor for greenlands hotel at visakhapatnam
3 irrelevant evidence was introduced and some evidence was introduced in a manner not authorised by the evidence act
that report showed that during the period 1948 49 rs 33 271 10 0 shown as paid to the andhra power system were in fact not paid
next according to the high court even if section 239 is applicable its provisions are subject to those of section 234 and as such the trial being for more than three offences was impermissible
when the respondent no i had to issue a personal cheque on any of these banks he used to ask the second respondent to send an equivalent amount to the bank concerned for being credited to his account
in 1944 this person resigned from his appointments and started his own business in radio and electrical goods in the name of d brothers
as a result of investigation they found that there was a total misappropriation of rs 3 40 000
srinivasa rao originally a stores boy
he was succeeded by t visweswara rao p w 6 an employee of the aeco
the approver who was originally an accounts clerk with the aeco was it may be mentioned appointed a cashier in vesco in 1946 at the instance of the respondent no i and was thus beholden to him
he was later promoted as senior accountant and in his place the respondent no 2
laksbminarayana rao was appointed the cashier
on the basis of the entries in the handover book the final accounts were written up
the shareholders felt that the report had been received but was being suppressed or deliberately withheld
according to it the provisions of section 239 were of no avail
according to the prosecution the respondent no i took both the approver and lakshminarayana rao in his confidence as also some other persons known and unknown for carrying out his nefarious purpose namely the misappropriation of the funds of vesco during the subsistence of aeco s managing agency of vesco
eventually their choice fell on g v subba raju p w 25 a resident of manchili who held a large number of shares in the aeco and who was besides related to r k n g raju by marriage
there were no complaints about the management of the affairs of vesco or the aeco till the end of 1946 or the beginning of 1947
one b rajan was elected auditor not only for vesco but for all the other four concerns including aeco
if the evidence of the approver is left out the remaining evidence would be inadequate to sustain the prosecution case
the conspiracy is said to have been hatched in the year 1947 and falsification of accounts and misappropriation of funds of vesco went on till the end of the accounting year
section g krishna aiyar after his appointment in january 1952 made close enquiry and submitted an interim report
at that time it used to be represented to him that the amounts which were shown to be in the safe and not found therein had been sent to the bank for being deposited
these amounts also used to be noted in the private note book and entered
on may 13 1954 a chargesheet was filed against the two respondents as well as murti and the approver ramana
but domestic consumers usually paid their bills in cash to the bill collectors who used to hand over their collections to the respondent no 2
the term of the managing agency was renewed in 1943 and aeco con tinued to be managing agents until the vesco was taken over by the government in 1952
i and some of his friends were in search of a rich and substantial man who would be amenable to them to fill the post of managing director of aeco
this amount was posted in vesco s cash handover book as by safe indicating that this amount was kept in the safe though in fact it was not
4 that the court abused its powers under s 342 cr
till the year 1945 messrs c p rao co a firm of chartered accountants were the auditors of vesco but after the respondent no i became secretary
i continued to be the secretary of vesco and resident representative of the managing agents throughout the period of conspiracy
in the first place according to the high court joint trial of two or more persons in respect of different offences cornmitted by each of them is illegal and that here as they were charged with having committed offences under section 120 b section 409 section 477 a and section 476467 i p c they could not be tried jointly
one significant fact however which occurred prior to 1946 is referred to by the prosecution
this amount was however paid by the aeco from the funds of vesco
after the death of r k n g raju it was discovered that the aeco was indebted to many concerns which were under its managing agency the liability being shown either as that of aeco or that of r k n g raju personally
again the vesco was shown as indebted to the andhra cement to the extent of rs 42 000
that was also the feeling of a number of shareholders who wanted to see the original but one dutt who was chairman of the meeting after seeing exhibit p 234 said that the report seemed to be a genuine one
the respondent no 2 was asked by the respondent no i to maintain a private note book
the evidence of the approver was inadmissible because the pardon granted to him was illegal that in any case it is unreliable was so found even by the sessions judge and must therefore be rejected
in that book payments which used to be made by respondent no 2 on the basis of slips issued by the respondent no i used to be noted and the amount totalled up at the end of the day
od september 13 1954 ramana offered to make a full confession to the additional district magistrate independent who was empowered to grant pardon under section 337 of i he code of criminal procedure
p c while conducting the examination of the respondents
another thing which the respondent no i initiated was opening a heading in the ledger called advance purchase of materials
however the meeting was postponed and eventually held on december 9 1951
the high court set aside the conviction of the respondents on a number of grounds
it may be mentioned that subba raju used to visit visakhapatnam twice a month and check up the account books
he however directed ramana to make his confession before a submagistrate
according to the prosecution the report is a forged document
amounts which had been misappropriated used to be posted therein though in fact no orders were placed for any material
as already stated the additional sessions judge convicted both the respondents the respondent no i in respect of each head of the offences with which he was charged and the respondent no 2 in respect only of the offences of conspiracy and misappropriation
the latter accordingly made a confession on november 15 1954 and on november 17 1954 the additional district magistrate independent granted him pardon and that is how he came to be examined as a witness in this case
on that date the respondent no 1 produced the auditor s report
