the assistant commissioner ghaziabad examined the printed wrappers
the appellants claimed that it has been using the wrapper since beginning and since 1991 the use of the trade name or brand name meghraj has never been challenged
he came to the conclusion vide his orders that the trade name meghraj was in the form of a logo printed on the wrapper of the biscuits and therefore the appellants were not entitled to the benefit of notification no 193 ce dated 28 2 93 as amended by notification no 5994 dated 1 3 94 consequently the adjudicating authority called upon the appellants to pay differential duty for the period april 1994 to june 1994 amounting to rs 374948 plus short paid duty for the period april 1995 to may 1995 amounting to rs 92992
aggrieved by the decision of the adjudicating authority the assessee preferred appeals to the commissioner a the said appeals were rejected on the ground that the appellants were using the brand name meghraj of another manufacturer m s kay aar biscuits p ltd on their products biscuits and therefore they were not entitled to the benefit of exemption under notification no 193 ce as amended
meghraj biscuits industries ltd or meghraj
it was held that the word meghraj was printed on all the printed wrappers and therefore it was wrong to say that the appellants were not using the brand name meghraj on its products
at this stage it may be noted that the appellants herein claim to have started manufacture of biscuits in 1991 the biscuits were sold in wrapper mentioning the name of the appellantsm s
in this connection reliance was placed by the commissioner a on the said agreement dated 22 11 89 before the commissioner a the appellants herein contended that they had used the name m s meghraj biscuits industries ltd on the wrapper and not on the product
and therefore they were entitled to exemption
this argument was rejected by the commissioner a saying that the appellants were using the brand name meghraj on their products
aggrieved by the decision of customs excise and gold control appellate tribunal cegat dated 11 4 2000the appellants assessee have come by way of civil appeals under section 35l of the central excise act1944
party no 1 under the agreement
under the said agreement m s kay aar biscuits p ltd was
the said agreement was valid for three years commencing from 22 11 1989
notification no 193 ce dated 28 2 93 was issued to help the ssi units to survive in the market dominated by brand name trade name
it was declared that m s kay aar biscuits p ltd was the owner of the registered trade mark meghraj
appellants were engaged in the manufacture of biscuits classifiable under sub heading 1905 11 of the central excise tariff
according to the commissioner athe appellants used the trade name meghraj in the form of a logo which was printed on the wrapper
ltd ghaziabad and m s rich food products p ltd noida
the object of the notification therefore was to help the ssi units and thereby increased industrial production
one more fact needs to be mentioned that on 30 6 2000 the registrar of trade marks appears to have issued registration certificate on 30 6 2000 registering the trade mark meghraj in favour of the appellants with effect form 30 9 91 it appears that issuance of this certificate was mentioned before the cegat which rejected the rectification application on 8 12 2000
ltd to use its trade mark for the manufacture of wafers alone
it was stated that m s kay aar biscuits p ltd was using the aforestated trade mark meghraj for the manufacture of biscuits
the said agreement m s kay aar biscuits p ltd gave permission to m s rich food products pvt
the biscuits were sold under the brand name meghraj
under the agreement there was a recital under which it was stated that m s
u s 28 of the trade marks act1999registration gives to the registered proprietor of the trade mark the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation to the goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered and to obtain relief in respect of infringement of the trade mark in the manner provided by the trade marks act
ltd had put up a unit for manufacture of wafers in noida which it sought to manufacture under the brand name meghraj
by order dated 8 12 2000cegat rejected the above rectification application made by the appellants
that agreement was between madan verma director of a company known as m s
it is correct to say that the registrar trade marks can issue registration certificate u s 28 of the trade marks act with retrospective effect
i have also pointed out that the statute which came to be enacted in england in 1875 and the subsequent statutes did nothing more than to embody the rights in relation to trade marks which were already laid down by the courts of equity
that was enough in the eyes of the courts of equity to entitle him to a relief by way of an injunction in case of an infringement of his mark by some other trader
under para 4 of the said notification the benefit of exemption was not available for excisable goods bearing brand name or trade name registered or not of another person
then came the english trade marks act of 1875which was substituted later by later acts
before the commissioner ait was argued in the alternative that the logo belonged to m s
all that was necessary for the plaintiff to prove was that he had used that mark in respect of his particular type of goods
under show cause notices it was alleged that the appellants herein assessee have sold the biscuits under the brand name meghrajwhich was a registered trade mark of kay aar biscuits p ltd who was using the said trade mark on manufacture of biscuits themselves and therefore the appellants were not eligible to the benefit of ssi notification no 193 ce dated 28 2 1993 as amended by notification no 5994 ce dated 1 3 1994
the trade marks act1999 has been enacted to amend and consolidate the law relating to trade marks to provide for registration and better protection of trade marks and for prevention of the use of fraudulent marks
the english acts enabled registration of a new mark not till then used with the like consequences which a distinctive mark had prior to the passing of the acts
the above show cause notices were issued by the department demanding differential duty for the period april 1994 to june 1994 amounting to rs 374948 plus short paid duty for the period april 1995 to may 1995 amounting to rs 92992 the said demand was based on an agreement detected by the department
as a matter of fact the statute enabled a person to have registered a mark not only which he had been using but also a mark which he proposed to use
there was no other basis on which those courts could give any relief to the plaintiffs in such cases and for the purpose of such relief the courts of equity did not require the plaintiff to prove that his mark by any length of user was associated in the minds of the public with his goods
it was further pointed out that in fact the appellants had applied for ownership of the brand name meghraj vide application dated 30 9 91 to the registrar trade marks under the trade marks act and that the said application for registration was pending before the competent authority and since the above arguments were not recorded in the impugned order of the cegat dated 11 4 2000 the same warranted rectification
the question before us is what is the effect of issuance of registration certificate with retrospective effect
the first trade marks act in england was passed in 1875 even prior thereto it was firmly established in england that a trader acquired a right of property in a distinctive mark merely by using it upon or in connection with goods irrespective of the length of such user and the extent of his trade and that he was entitled to protect such right of property by appropriate proceedings by way of injunction in a court of law
applying the above test to the facts of the present case madan verma is a common director in the two companies
even if it is found to be necessary to decide this question as to property in a trade mark i have already pointed out that the courts of equity in england granted relief in cases of infringement of trade marks on the basis of infringement of the right of property in the trade mark
it was further held that the burden is on the assessee to satisfy the adjudicating authority that there was no such intention
to complete the chronology of events it may be pointed out that after the impugned decision of the tribunal dated 11 4 2000the appellants herein moved an application for rectification on 12 5 2000 rom no 722000 in that application it was urged on behalf of the appellants herein that the said brand name meghraj did not belong to m s kay aar biscuits p ltd that the department has failed to discharge its burden to prove that the trade name meghraj belonged to m s kay aar biscuits p ltd that a mere agreement between m s
rich food products p ltd would not be sufficient to prove that m s kay aar biscuits p ltd was the lawful owner of the brand name
the orders of the commissioner a have been confirmed by order dated 11 4 2000 passed by cegat
in many of those cases the dispute was between a foreign trader using a foreign mark in a foreign country on goods which were subsequently imported by indian importers and sold by them in this country under that very mark
in short it was a competition between a foreign trader and the indian importer for the proprietorship of that mark in this country
in our opinion it is not necessary in this case to go into details about facts in the various decided cases dealing with importer s marks
as already stated by me while referring to the observations of sir john romily it is not really necessary for me to decide in this case as to whether there could or could not be any property in a trade mark for the purpose of deciding this case
we have already reached a conclusion that so far as this country is concerned degoumois co have totally disclaimed any interest in the proprietorship of that mark for watches etc
several authorities were cited and were considered and principles deduced and relied upon in that behalf
he has filed an affidavit enclosing the registration certificate dated 30 6 2000
the latter type of mark would evidently refer to a distinctive mark a mark which does not directly describe the nature or quality of the goods to which it is attached
our trade marks law is based on the english trade marks law and the english acts
apparently in such a case there is no question of infringement of any right of property in a trade mark for which any relief is sought nor is there any question of passing off so that it might be necessary to enter into questions of nicety as regards whether there could or could not be any property in a trade mark
accordingly the commissioner a dismissed the appeals
further there is no evidence to show as to whether m s kay aar biscuits p ltd was an eligible manufacturer
this question has been decided by the bombay high court in the case of sunder parmanand lalwani and others v caltex india ltd air 1969 bombay 24 1965 indlaw mum 1419 in which it has been held vide paras 32 and 38 as follows a proprietary right in a mark can be obtained in a number of ways
this aspect is important since one of the arguments advanced by the appellants herein before the commissioner a was that the trade mark belonged to m s ltd which was registered ssi unit lying closed since 1 3 1993
the effect of the relevant provision of the english acts was that registration of a trade mark would be deemed to be equivalent to public user of such mark
in india the mark caltex was a totally new mark for watches and allied goods
