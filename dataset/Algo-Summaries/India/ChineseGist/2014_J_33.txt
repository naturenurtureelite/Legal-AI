for determination of the issue involved in c a nos 6169 6171 of 2013 and c a nos 6172 6174 of 2013it is desirable to refer the relevant factual matrix of the case which is as follows.
the proprietors of respondent company namely m s jaswant sugar mills ltd had six business units as under m s.
jaswant sugar mills.
meerut straw board mills.
northern india paper mills.
bindal vanaspati ghee mills.
meduwala open pan sugar bijnor.
subsequently the company was acquired by the state on 28th october1984.
in between 1977 to 1984for smooth functioning of the sugar mill payment of dues to sugarcane grower repairing of machinery etc.
during the pendency of the aforesaid writ petition the state government issued a notification dated 14th august1987 u s 4 read with s 174 of the land acquisition act1894 for the meerut development authority.
it was followed by a notification dated 4th september1987 issued u s 6 of the acquisition act.
against the said order dated 4th october1994 passed by the prescribed authority the appellant filed appeal no 195 before the appellate tribunal.
hence the appointment of receiver was terminated with immediate effect.
during the pendency of the said case the chairman board of revenue by order dated 3rd august1996 directed that out of the total amount of rs 4 33 crores received as compensation from meerut development authority after deduction of a sum of rs 1 62 crores along with interest and collection charges the balance amount shall be refunded to the company.
in the said case the u p state sugar corporation ltd filed a counter affidavit refuting such stand taken by the company.
a separate counter affidavit was filed by the deputy secretary sugar and cane development lucknow giving details of dues payable by the company as detailed by the district collector meerut by his order dated 18th december1995.
against the interim order the appellant state filed the special appeals.
it was ordered to dispose of the writ petition expeditiously.
the said notice was also challenged by the company.
with direction to the appellant to pay the compensation amount to the company.
subsequently impugned common judgment and order dated 1st.
march2011 was passed in writ petition no 313781996etc.
with observation and directions as referred to above.
according to the appellant the aforesaid issue has not been decided.
it was in arrears to the extent of rs 1 29 crores.
in between 1979 and 1984the state government extended a facility of loan to the extent of rs 6 13 crores to the receiver appointed by the state government for smooth functioning of the sugar mill including payment of dues to sugarcane grower repairing of machinery etc.
it is also not in dispute that labour and other dues were payable by the company apart from sale tax dues and the loan was given by the state government between 1977 1984 for payment of such dues.
the high court by the impugned judgment dated 1st march2011though noticed the aforesaid facts including the fact that the collector tulsi gaur by order dated 20th february1992 held that there were dues of about rs 10 44 crores payable by the company part of which can be adjusted from the compensation amount paid by the meerut development authority even thereafter an amount of rs 6 09 crores will remain payable by the company but the high court failed to address such issue.
the high court though noticed that s 8 of the u p state sugar undertakings acquisition act1971 empowers the prescribed authority to decide any dispute regarding the amount payable to any person or authority in respect of earlier liabilities of the undertaking but it wrongly held that in view of the provisions of the u p sugar undertakings acquisition act1971.
the collector tulsi gaur was not a party by name.
the same is accordingly set aside.
on the other hand if any amount is found payable by the company the competent authority may recover the amount in accordance with law.
for determination of the issue involved in c a nos 7122 of 20037123 7124 of 20037125 of 2003 and 7126 7129 of 2003 relevant factual matrix of the case is as follows.

as against the said order c a nos 7126 292003.
commissioner meerut division meerut ors.
jaswant sugar mills ltd have been preferred by the commissioner meerut division meerut.
the said case was also tagged with the aforesaid appeals.
the question arises as to whether in such a situation an auction purchaser can claim interest on equitable ground.
this court in the said case held 10 the crucial question is whether there can be any direction for interest on rental compensation once it is held that the same has to be paid within the time frame notwithstanding the fact that there is no statutory obligation.
this factor can not be lost sight of while working out the equities.
it would therefore be appropriate if the appellants pay interest.
in the present case we find that there was no mis representation on the part of the auction purchasers they deposited the total auction amount within the time stipulated.
taking into consideration the aforesaid factor while working out equities it would therefore be appropriate to direct the state to pay interest at the rate of 6 on the amount to be refunded as per the high court 's order with effect from 27th april2001 and 3rd.
september2001the day the high court passed the impugned order.
the concerned respondents are directed accordingly.
the appeals c a nos 7126 7129 of 2003 filed by the commissioner meerut are dismissed.
