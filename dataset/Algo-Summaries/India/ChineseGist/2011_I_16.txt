this appeal is directed against the final judgment and order dated 03 10 2007 passed by the high court of judicature andhra pradesh at hyderabad in criminal appeal no 436 of 2001 whereby the high court dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant herein and confirmed the judgment dated 19 03 2001 passed by the special judge c b i cases visakhapatnam in c c no 2 of 1998.
brief facts a the appellant accused was working as a head clerk in the traffic cadre section in the office of the senior divisional personnel officer south central railway vijayawada during the period from april1992 to november1997 the nature of duties of the appellant accused included dealing with and processing of the matters like promotions transfers seniority list roster list pay fixation on promotions retirements resignations etc of the personnel.
one k rama rao the complainant who was examined as pw 1was posted as yard points man grade a under station superintendent south central railway tanuku from december1995 to june1997 in june1997due to excess staff at tanuku.
thereafter he went back to tanuku from where he was subsequently transferred to rajahmundry.
thereafter pw 1 made a representation to his senior officer requesting him for posting at vijayawada cheerala vetapalam or tenali.
later pw 1 was transferred to vijayawada.
as the appellant accused was dealing with the transfers the complainant pw 1 met him on 05 11 1997 at his office to pursue about the issuance of the said transfer order.

on 15 11 1997at 7 30 a m.
an fir was registered by the inspector cbi visakhapatnam branch in crime No.
read with s 132 of the act.
heard mr atm rangaramanujam learned senior counsel for the appellant and mr harish chandra learned senior counsel for the respondent.
notice only on quantum of sentence hearing on all aspects.
on 28 01 2008this court consisting of three honourable judges issued notice in this matter confining to the quantum of sentence only.
the trial court ordered that both the sentences of imprisonment shall run concurrently.
the said conviction and sentence was affirmed by the high court.
if we confine ourselves to the limited extent of notice dated 28 01 2008we have to hear both sides only on the quantum of sentence.
however mr rangaramanujam learned senior counsel for the appellant by drawing our attention to the recent judgment of this court in yomeshbhai pranshankar bhatt vs state of gujarat2011 6 scc 312 2011 indlaw sc 370submitted that in spite of limited notice this court while exercising jurisdiction u art 142 of the constitution in order to do complete justice while hearing the matter finally can go into the merits of the orders passed by the trial court and the high court.
in the reported case the appeal was against the concurrent finding of both the courts convicting the appellant u s 302 ipc and sentencing him to suffer imprisonment for life.
this court referred to the supreme court rules1966 which have been framed u art 145 of the constitution and also considered scope of its power u art 142 as well as order 47.
rule 6 of the code of civil procedure1908.
the question whether the court will enlarge the scope of its inquiry at the time of final hearing depends on the facts and circumstances of the case.
since in the facts of this case we find that the appellant should be heard on all points we have come to the aforesaid conclusion.
as a matter of fact the last sentence in para 18 makes it clear that in the facts and circumstances of that case they permitted the appellants to urge all points on merits.
the high court as an appellate court once again analysed all the material discussed the oral and documentary evidence and finding that the prosecution had proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt concurred with the conclusion arrived at by the trial court and dismissed the appeal of the appellant.
inasmuch as both the courts have thoroughly discussed the oral and documentary evidence with reference to the charges leveled against the appellant and in view of the limited order dated 28 01 2008 by this court issuing notice confining to quantum of sentence only and even applying the analogy enunciated in yomeshbhai 2011 indlaw sc 370 suprawe feel that it is not a case of such nature that the appellant should be heard on all points consequently we reject the request of the learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant.
quantum of sentence.
whether requires any reduction.
with this factual position let us consider whether the request of the learned senior counsel for the appellant is to be accepted and sentence be reduced to the period already undergone.
it is not in dispute that the provisions of the prevention of corruption act1988 alone are applicable since the incident occurred on 14 11 1997 i e subsequent to the act.
s 13 deals with criminal misconduct by a public servant.
for clarity we reproduce the said section hereunder criminal misconduct by a public servant  1.
s 52 of the 1947 act mandates that any public servant who commits criminal misconduct shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than one year but which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine.
such relaxation in the form of a proviso has been done away with in the 1988 act.
no other interpretation is permissible.
other circumstances pleaded for reduction of sentence.
we have gone through the facts in that case.
thereafter the same was challenged before this court.
this court after holding that the conclusion of the trial court and high court does not suffer from any infirmity considered the alternative submission which related to harshness of sentence.
since the appellant therein was convicted only u s 7 and s 161 cr.
there is no dispute as regards the date of occurrence and the date of conviction passed by the trial court and affirmed by the high court.
accordingly we reject the said contention.
about the request based on delay that the appellant has lost his job undergone the ordeal all along etc a lenient view be taken in this case it is useful to refer decision of this court in state of m p vs.

nagar2006 8 scc 693 2006.
the corruption by public servants has become a gigantic problem.
it has spread everywhere.
no facet of public activity has been left unaffected by the stink of corruption.
it has deep and pervasive impact on the functioning of the entire country.
as has been aptly observed in swatantar singh v state of haryana1997 4 scc 14 1997 indlaw sc 1061corruption is corroding like cancerous lymph nodes the vital veins of the body politics social fabric of efficiency in the public service and demoralising the honest officers.
art 142 and its applicability.
however the court rejected the said application vide order dated 01 12 2009 observing that the court was not competent to waive the required statutory period of six months under the act and such a waiver was permissible only under the directions of the supreme court as held by this court in anil kumar jain vs maya jain2009.

the said power is not vested with any other court.
however we have also noticed various judgments of this court taking a contrary view to the effect that in case the legal ground for grant of divorce is missing exercising such power tantamounts to legislation and thus transgression of the powers of the legislature which is not permissible in law vide chetan dass v kamla devi 2001 4 scc 250 2001 indlaw sc 20206 and vishnu dutt sharma.

this court held as under sympathy or sentiment by itself can not be a ground for passing an order in relation whereto the appellants miserably fail to establish a legal right.
despite an extraordinary constitutional jurisdiction contained in art 142 of the constitution of india this court ordinarily would not pass an order which would be in contravention of a statutory provision.
emphasis added.
after saying so the court rejected the request of the parties to waive the statutory period of six months under the act.
in mota ram vs state of haryana2009 12 scc 727 2009 indlaw sc 682this court while reiterating the above principles has concluded that art 142 can not be exercised to negate the statutory provisions.
the question is having held that rule 44i to be invalid whether we can permit the continuation of the ban on sale of non iodised salt for human consumption for any period.
in supreme court bar association v union of india 1998 4 scc 409.
1998 indlaw sc 688this court observed the supreme court in exercise of its jurisdiction u art 142 has the power to make such order as is necessary for doing complete justice between the parties in any cause or matter pending before it.
indeed this court is not a court of restricted jurisdiction of only dispute settling.
it is a problem solver in the nebulous areas see.

in kalyan chandra sarkar v rajesh ranjan 2005 3.
scc 284 2005 indlaw sc 93this court after reiterating that this court in exercise of its jurisdiction u art 142 of the constitution would not pass any order which would amount to supplanting substantive law applicable to the case or ignoring express statutory provisions dealing with the subject observed as follows.
the advantage that is derived from a constitutional provision couched in such a wide compass is that it prevents clogging or obstruction of the stream of justice.
see supreme court bar association 1998 indlaw sc 688 supra.
u art 142 of the constitution would not ordinarily direct quashing of a case involving crime against the society particularly.
we have perused those orders.
in the absence of such details we are unable to rely on those orders.
in a case of corruption by public servant quantum of amount is immaterial.
merely because the delinquent lost his job due to conviction under the act may not be a mitigating circumstance for reduction of sentence particularly when the statute prescribes minimum sentence.
though art 142 of the constitution gives wider power to this court waiver of certain period as prescribed in the statute imposing lesser sentence than the minimum prescribed is not permissible.
in other words this court can not altogether ignore the substantive provisions of a statute.
consequently the appeal fails and the same is dismissed.
since the appellant is on bail the bail bonds executed by him stand cancelled.
the trial judge is directed to secure his presence for serving the remaining period of sentence.
appeal dismissed.
