the collector has no power to adjudicate the dues under the u p zamindari abolition and land revenue act and is merely a recovery agent to recover sums payable as arrears of land revenue upon receipt of a valid recovery certificate.

as the order dated 18th december1995passed by the district collector meerut is silent about the amount payable to the company the ex proprietor of the company moved an application before the chairman board of revenue and requested to refund the compensation amount to the company.
against the same a writ petition no 39051987 was preferred by the company.
permission to file the special leave petition is granted.
the order dated 20th february1992 passed by the collector was also not under challenge inspite of the same the high court declared the order dated 20th february1992 as illegal.
but for the reasons mentioned by the high court the sale has been cancelled.
the review application was disposed of by an order dated 3rd september2001 with the following observations in view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances in my opinion it will meet the ends of justice if i grant three months time to the respondent no 2 and 3 to refund the amount in question to the auction purchasers application during this time the said amount shall positively be paid to them.
in a situation like in the present case one can not hold of any statute entitling the auction purchasers to claim interest in case the auction got cancelled or set aside by the court of law.
on the other hand if any amount is found payable by the company the competent authority may recover the amount in accordance with law.
