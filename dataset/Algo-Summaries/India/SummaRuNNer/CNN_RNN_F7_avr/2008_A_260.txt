for the sake of convenience we refer to the facts mentioned in civil appeal no of 2008 arising out of s l p c no 15729 of 2008 filed by j mitra co pvt ltd.
this matter is a classic illustration of the confusion which has emerged on account of the postponement of in part commencement of patents amendment act2005.
quite often the commencement of an act is postponed to some specified future date or to such date as the appropriate government may by notification in the official gazette appoint.
after scrutiny the said application stood notified by the patent office on 20 11 2004.
only certain sections of the patents amendment act2005 were brought into force.
thus proceedings commenced before the controller of patents in the year 2000 when the appellant herein sought a patent of their device which was opposed by respondent no 3 in the year 2000 by then the patents amendment act1999 had amended the patents act1970 w e f 26 3 99 s 25 of the patents act1970 as amended by patents amendment act1999 dealt with opposition to a patent vides s 25 at that time appeals against decisions made by the controller pertaining to pre grant oppositions under s 25 were maintainable before the high court u s 1162 of the indian patents act1970.
no 29306would remain in the high court.
under the patents amendment act2005appeal is provided to the appellate board against the order of the controller under s 254 however that statutory appeal is maintainable only in post grant opposition proceedings whereas respondent no 3 herein has instituted first appeals under the law then prevailing challenging the order rejecting pre grant opposition dated 23 8 06.
taking into account the complexities involved in this case on account of a hiatus created by reason of the law not being brought into force in time we are of the view that the first appeals filed by respondent no 3 in the high court being fao.
act1999 continued to be in operation notwithstanding the enactment of the patents.
act1970 as amended by the patents amendment act1999 w e f 26 3 99.
in the present case the legislature intended to provide for two types of scrutiny followed by one statutory appeal to the appellate board against post grant proceedings.
an act can not be said to commence or to be in force unless it is brought into operation by legislative enactment or by the exercise of authority by a delegate empowered to bring it into operation.
in short by the patents amendment act2005for the first time a dichotomy was introduced in the patent law between opposition to the pre grant and opposition to the post grant of patent.
that amended s 117 g is consequential to the enforcement of the jurisdiction of the appellate board u s 64 which results to revocation of patent.
similarly under the patents amendment act2005appeal was restricted to the post grant opposition orders and that appeal lay before the appellate board and not to the high court.
the legislature intended to provide for only one statutory appeal to the appellate board but by not bringing s 61 into force till 2 4 07appeals filed during the interregnum as in this case became vulnerable and liable to be dismissed as misconceived as is contended by the appellant.
on 19 10 06 the old law prevailed under which an appeal lay before the high court.
the result is that although the legislature intended to provide for only one statutory appeal to the appellate board by reason of s 61 of the patents amendment act2005 not being brought into force till 2 4 07 a strange situation developed.
on 19 10 2006 when fao no 29306 was filed in the high court chapter xix of the parent act as amended vide patents amendment.
therefore the legislature intended an appeal under section 117a2 to the appellate board from any decision order or direction of the controller inter alia under s 254 which refers to the power of the controller to maintain amend or revoke the patent.
there is however a radical shift due to incorporation of s 252 where an interested party is granted the right to challenge the patent after its grant.
the legislature enacted the patents amendment act2005 even here not all provisions were simultaneously brought into force.
according to the appellant with the change in s 25 brought about by patents amendment act2005a dichotomy was introduced in the patents act1970 according to the appellant that dichotomy was between pre grant opposition and post grant opposition.
it is during this interregnum that respondent no 3 filed its fao no 29306 in the high court under section 116as.
it stood on 19 10 06 under the patents amendment act1999 on that date the amended section 117a suggested by patents amendment act2005was not brought into force.
in the special circumstances of this case particularly when after 2 4 07 appeals against orders rejecting pre grant opposition are not maintainable and particularly when fao no 29206 and fao no 29306 were filed by respondent no 3 prior to 2 4 07 under the old law we are of the view that these two appeals shall be heard and decided by the high court in accordance with law.
e that the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification is obvious and clearly does not involve any inventive step having regard to the matter published as mentioned in cl b or having regard to what was used in india before the priority date of the claim h that the patentee has failed to disclose to the controller the information required by s 8 or has furnished the information which in any material particular was false to his knowledge i that in the case of a patent granted on convention application the application for patent was not made within twelve months from the date of the first application for protection for the invention made in a convention country or in india by the patentee or a person from whom he derives title j that the complete specification does not disclose or wrongly mentions the source and geographical origin of biological material used for the invention k that the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification was anticipated.
we quote herein below ss 25 and 116 as it stood in the year 2000 under the patents amendment act1999 which read as under s 25 opposition to grant of patent.
here also s 25 of the patents act1970 as amended by patents amendment act2005.
which refers to pre grant opposition and post grant opposition was brought into force on and from 1 1 2005 whereas amended section 117a by which appeal was provided for against post grant opposition order was not brought into force till 2 4 2007 one more aspect needs to be mentioned.
we also quote s 61 of the patents amendment act2005 which reads as under s 61 in section 117a of the principal act as inserted by s 47 of the patents amendment act2002in.
the said appeals would be heard and disposed of by the high court in accordance with law u s 116 of the said 1970 act as it stood on 19 10 06 the high court will hear and decide the validity of the order passed by the controller dated 23 8 06 rejecting pre grant opposition filed by respondent.
suffice it to note that under patents amendment act1999 there was only one right given to a person interested to oppose the grant of patent by filing objections at the pre grant stage.
however the legislature intended that there shall be only one statutory appeal against grant of patent.
no 29206 and fao.
the legislature intended to obliterate appeal from pre grant proceedingswhich existed earlier.
the legislature intended to have a dichotomy between pre grant opposition and post grant opposition.
previously the only provision of challenge by an interested party was a pre grant challenge under s 25 1 as it then stood.
having regard to the knowledge oral or otherwise available within any local or indigenous community in india or elsewhere but on no other ground.
therefore the courts had evolved the rule of caution as the patent had not faced any challenge at the hands of interested parties.
the appellate board after 2 4 07 is entitled to hear appeals only arising from orders passed by the controller under s 254i e.
therefore there is no point in transferring the pending fao no 29206 and fao no 29306 to the appellate board which has no authority to decide matters concerning pre grant opposition.
according to the appellant this was a structural change in the principal act.
this section was not brought into force till 2 4 2007.
for some unknown reasons the amended ss 116 and 117a2 were not brought into force till 2 4 07 whereas the concept of pre grant and post grant oppositions were brought into force w e f 1 1 2005 this is where the legislative intent got defeated during the interregnum.
this is the main rationale underlying s 252 of the said 1970 act.
as stated above quite often the commencement of an act is postponed to some specific future date or to such date as the appropriate government may by notification in the official gazette appoint.
act2005 as the amended ss 116 and 117a were brought into force only vide notification dated 2 4 07 one more point needs to be noted.
however s 251 is wider than s 252 as the latter is available only to a person aggrieved.
the ground of challenge under s 251 is identical to s 252 of the said 1970 act.
however it was left to the executive to bring the enacted law into force vide notification.
vide cl 47 of notes on clauses attached to the statement of objects and reasons it has been clarified that s 64 is also amended vide patents amendment act2005 to confer wider jurisdiction on the appellate board in matters of revocation of patent therefore amended section 117 g which is brought into force only from 3 4 2007 dealt with transfer of pending proceedings from the high court to the appellate board.
