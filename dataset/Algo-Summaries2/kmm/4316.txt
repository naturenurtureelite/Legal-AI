Taking all these factors into consideration, it made an award dated 20th December, 1978 prescribing the following revision in the existing scales of wages: Grade & Category Existing Grade/ Revised Grade/ Scale Scale I Peon/Helper/ Rs
Nothing those facts, the Tribunal observed that compared with the increased paying capacity of the appellant, an inference drawn from the prosperity enjoyed by the appellant over the years, there was definite need for revising the wage scales
But it rejected the demand of the Union for dearness allowance on the basis of a slab system, because that would have imposed an unacceptable burden on the appellant 's financial capacity and there was no reason why the existing scheme of dearness allowance should be disturbed when a substantial increase was being made in the level of the basic wage
The Tribunal took note of the elaborate scales of wages already existing in the wage structure of the appellant and decided "to modify the existing structure of the scales with flat increases in each category "
The need for revising the wage scales was not disputed by the appellant
100/ in other categories resulting from the order dated 22nd December, 1978
Holding it impossible in the circumstances to apply the principle of industry cum region basis, the Tribunal turned to a consideration of the financial capacity of the company to bear an additional burden
In proceeding to revise the wage structure the Tribunal took into account the two principles involved in the process, the financial capacity of the industry to bear the burden of an increased wage bill, and the prevailing wage structure on an industry cum region basis
170 The Union filed a statement before the Tribunal claiming an upward revision of the wage scales and dearness allowance and an increase from fifteen years to twenty years in the span for earning annual increments
7 crores, a burden which would dry up the appellant 's resources and would be impossible for it to bear
We have been taken through some of the material on the record in the attempt to support the contention, but after giving careful thought to the matter, I think there is ample justification for what the Tribunal did
The Tribunal also noted that after the salaries of the employees had been fixed in the respective scales, senior employees would have to be given some more increments in the new scales according to their completed years of service
We are not impressed with the submission of the learned counsel for the Company that the corrigendum was in effect a fresh award

It functions as a consulting organisation and a service industry, and does not manufacture any product or carry on trade
It decided also that there was no ground for deducting the notional value of gratuity
In travelling outside and beyond the terms of the original award, the Tribunal has committed a jurisdictional error
This liability taken with the liability accruing on the need to increase the salaries of the other staff determined the Tribunal 's deliberations in regard to the several features of the award, including the grant of increments related to completed periods of service, the expansion of the span from 15 years to 20 years for earning increments, and other benefits
The only contention of the workmen is that the Tribunal should have fixed the dearness allowance in communion with the cost of living index
The Union modified its demands but even the modified terms, according to the Tribunal, appeared to be on the high side inasmuch as the resulting total burden of Rs
Taking into account the circumstance that besides the staff of 306 workmen represented by the Union there were several other employees who would also have to be paid, the Tribunal considered it fair, in paragraph 23 of the award, to give a flat increase of Rs
Further, it appears that the Tribunal intended to grant the increase of Rs
On the same date, the Tribunal disposed of the application by the following order: "There can be no doubt that a flat increase of Rs
The Tribunal maintained the existing schemes of dearness allowance and house rent allowance, and observed that in view of the revised basic wages there would be a resultant increase in the dearness allowance and house rent allowance
Individual workmen were not present to the mind of the Tribunal
The Tribunal has given satisfactory reason for adopting a different mode and we are not disposed to interfere with the award of the Tribunal
None of the alternatives was actually adopted by the Tribunal, because when the award was made the Tribunal proceeded instead to restructure the wage scales by the addition of Rs
Thereafter the Tribunal made an order on the same day in the following terms: "There can be no doubt that a flat increase of Rs
Dearness allowance became payable at 10% of the basic wage subject to a minimum of Rs
There will be no explanation why the initial start of the revised pay scales has been increased by Rs

It also observed that the category of Draughtsmen needed a special increase
173 Two days after the award was made, an application was made by the Union stating: "In the said award, your Honour has observed, at the end of para 22, "In view of the increase that is being allowed in the basic pay, I do not propose to revise the existing scheme of Dearness Allowance "
Having regard to the not inconsiderable improvement in the level of the basic wage, it observed that there would be a consequent increase in the dearness allowance and house rent allowance
Reference was also made to Bengal Chemical & Pharmaceutical Works Limited vs Its Workmen

For the purpose of determining the financial capacity of the appellant, the Tribunal followed Unichem Laboratories vs Their Workmen(1) where it was held that the gross profits should be computed without making deductions on account of taxation, development rebate and depreciation
Reliance was placed on The Hindustan Times Ltd, New Delhi vs Their Workmen where it was observed by this Court that dearness allowance should not 179 remain fixed at any figure but should be on a sliding scale in order to neutralise a portion of the increase in the cost of living
Implicit and intrinsically connected with the question of revision of the wage scales were the questions of fitment of employees into the wage scales and flat or ad hoc increase of salaries of workmen wherever considered necessary
Having regard to the net profits earned by the appellant from 1968 to 1977 it found that the acceptance of the demands of the Union would result in an increased burden of Rs
Revising the figures on that basis, it computed the annual gross profits for the years 1968 to 1977 and determined the annual average at Rs
The appellant had introduced various pay scales in 1973 and some time later they were revised
