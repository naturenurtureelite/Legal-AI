It may also be observed that by ordering that a question may properly to put to a witness who was being examined, no case was decided by the Trial Court
On September 1, 1963, Filmistan filed suit No
In the view of the Trial Court the question whether the legal relationship arising out of the agreement dated December 1, 1960 was in the nature of a lease or of other character had to be decided at the trial and the previous judgment being a judgment by consent , 'could not operate as res judicata", for, it was not a decision of the Court, and that the consent decree in suit No
441 In the present case the Court of Small Causes had only decided that a question seeking information about the true legal relationship arising out of the document could be permitted to 'be put to the witnesses for Filmistan
It is not open to any Court of law to try an issue over again or reopen the same if an earlier decision operates as res judicata
But the High Court has recorded a finding that the agreement dated November 27, 1954, created a lease and that the consent decree operated as res judicata
This suit was filed against the receivers in insolvency of the owners of the theatre, against Raval and Faraqui, against Tejabwala and also against Baldevdas Shivlal who claimed to be the owner of the theatre
After issues were raised on June 20, 1966, the plaint was amended and additional written statements were filed by the Defendants
Filmistan then applied to the Court of Small Causes for an order that issues Nos
being recorded, counsel for the defendants asked in cross examination the question whether the "agreement between the plaintiff and defendant Nos
Counsel for Filmistan contended that an enquiry into the nature of the legal relationship arising out of the agreement dated December 1, 1960 "was barred by the principle of res judicata and estoppel under the provisions of section 92 of the Evidence Act", since the question was already concluded by the consent decree in suit No
A matter in contest in a suit may operate as res judicata only if there is an adjudication by the Court : the terms of section II of the Code leave no scope for a contrary view
The Court also rejected the contention that there was any bar of estoppel, and held that evidence as to the true nature of the transaction was not inadmissible by virtue of section 92 of the Evidence Act
Again it was for the Trial Court in the first instance to decide that question and there after the High Court could, if the matter were brought before it by way of appeal or in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction, have decided that question
The learned Judge was then requested to frame three additional issues in view of the amended pleadings : the issues were: 1
The learned Judge will not proceed with the trial"
11, 12 and 13 will be rectified by the learned Trial Judge
The objection was raised as 439 an attempt to reopen the previous decision given by the Trial Judge refusing to try issues Nos
The High Court referred to a number of authorities and observed that the correctness of the findings of the Trial Court on issues Nos
Thereafter elaborate arguments were advanced and the Trial Judge passed an order disallowing the objection
The Trial Judge in overruling the objection did not decide any issues at the stage of recording evidence : he was not called upon to decide any issues at that stage
in the theatre, and that one Shabeer Hussain Khan Tejabwala had no right, title or interest in the theatre, that the defendants in the suit be ordered to hand over vacant and peaceful possession of the theatre, and the defendants, their servants and agents be restrained by an injunction from interfering directly or indirectly with its rights to obtain and remain in possession of the theatre or any part thereof and to exercise its right of exhibiting "motion pictures" and entertainment performances etc
The learned Judge observed that the issues were not purely of law, that in any event the case or any part thereof was not likely to be disposed of on these issues, and that ordinarily in "appealable cases" the Court should, as far as possible, decide all the issues together and that piecemeal trial might result in protracting the litigation
