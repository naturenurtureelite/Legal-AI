it Petition No 459 & 460 of 1988
(Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India)
Harish N Salve, SV Kamdar and MN Shroff for the Petitioners
PK Goswami, Additional Solicitor General, Kailash Vasdev and Ms A Subhashini for the Respondents
The Judgement of the Court was delivered by SC AGRAWAL, J These petitions under Article 32 of the Constitution raise a common question as to the validity of sub para (10) of para 218 of the Import & Export Policy for the period April, 1988 to March, 1991
236 The petitioners in both these writ petitions are partnership firms carrying on business of import of rough diamonds and export of cut and polished diamonds
The Import & Export Policy for the period April 1978 to March 1979, in para 174, made provision for grant of certain import facilities to Export Houses which were registered in accordance with the provisions of the said Policy
One of the said facilities was grant of an Additional licence in terms of para 176 of the said Policy for an amount to be calculated at one third the fob value of the exports of select products made by the Export House in the year 1977 78
The petitioners submitted application for registration as Export Houses and for grant of Export House Certificate which would have entitled them to the grant of such Additional licence
The said applications of the petitioners were rejected by the authorities on the view that petitioners had failed to diversify their export of "Other Products" during the year 1977 78
The said order refusing the Export Certificate was challenged by the petitioners by filing writ petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution before the Bombay High Court
One of those writ petitions (filed by the petitioners in writ petition No 460 of 1988 herein) was dismissed by a learned Single Judge of the High Court and the said petitioners filed an appeal before a Division Bench of the High Court
While the said appeal and the other writ petition (filed by the petitioners viz writ petition No 459 of 1988 herein) were pending in the Bombay High Court, this Court decided Civil Appeal No 1423 of 1984, Union of India vs Rajnikant Brothers, and other connected matters by order dated April 18, 1985, wherein it was observed that there was no requirement of diversification of exports as a condition for the grant of Export House Certificates in theImport Policy for the year 1978 1979, and the authorities were directed to issue necessary Export Certificates for the year 1978 79
In that order this Court laid down the following conditioned: "Save and except items which are specifically banned under the prevalent import policy at the time of import, the respondents shall be entitled to import all other items whether canalised or otherwise in accordance with the relevant rules"
The writ petition and the appeal were decided by the Bombay High Court in accordance with the aforesaid decision of this Court in the case of Union of India vs Rajnikant Brothers, (supra) and the High Court directed the authorities to grant Export House Certificates to the petitioners under the Import Policy 1978 79 within three months
While giving the said direction the High Court imposed a condition in 237 the same terms as laid down by this Court in its order dated April 18, 1985, referred to above
While construing the aforesaid direction contained in its order dated April 18, 1985, in Rajnikant Brothers case (supra) this Court has held that the grantees of the Additional licences were not only prohibited from importing items which were excluded under the Export Policy 1978 79 but also from importing items excluded under the Import Policy prevailing at the time of import and that the word "banned" was intended to take in terms which were banned altogether as well as items which were banned for import by the holder of an Additional licence
(See: Raj Prakash Chemicals Ltd & Anr
vs Union of India & Ors
; In Union of India vs M/s Godrej Soaps Pvt Ltd & Anr, ; this Court construed the words 'whether canalised or otherwise ' contained in the order dated April 18, 1985, passed in Rajnikant Brothers case (supra) and it was observed that the Court would not know whether in the future certain canalised items could be imported directly by an Export House holding an Additional licence and that the possibility of a policy being framed in the future enabling an Export House holding an Additional licence to directly import items which are `non canalised ' and also item which are `canalised ' could not be ruled out and it was in this light that the Court can be said to have used the words "whether canalised or otherwise" in the order dated April 18, 1985
The matter was further clarified by this Court in DNavinchandra & Co Bombay & Anr
vs Union of India & Ors
, ; , wherein this Court has observed: "Analysing the said order, it is apparent, (1) that the importation that was permissible was of goods which were not specifically banned, (2) such banning must be under the prevalent import policy at the time of import, and (3) whether items which were canalised or uncanalised would be imported in accordance with the relevant rules
These conditions had to be fulfilled
The Court never did and could not have said that canalised items could be imported in any manner not permitted nor it could have given a go bye to canalisation policy"
(P 1000) In accordance with the directions given by the Bombay High Court the petitioners in writ petition No 459 of 1988 herein were granted the Export House Certificate and were also granted an Additional licence dated November 16, 1987
Similarly, the petitioners in 238 writ petition No 460 of 1988 herein were granted the Export House Certificate and an Additional licence dated August 31, 1987
These licences were valid for a period of 12 months and they contained the following endorsement: "This licence in valid for import of items permissible to Export Houses under the Additional Licence category as per para 176 of Import Policy for the period 1978 79 excluding those items which were banner in the policy for the period 1978 79 and those which have been specifically banned in the prevailing Import Policy, 1985 88, pursuant to and subject to the decision of the Supreme Court dated 531986 in M/s Raj Prakash Chemicals case civil appeal No 4978 of 1985; the decision dated 1551986 in the case of M/s Indo Afghan Chamber of Commerce writ petition No 199 of 1986, the decision dated 12986 in the case of M/s Godrej Soap Pvt
Ltd civil appeal No 3418/1986; the decision dated 1291986 in the case of M/s Star Diamonds Company of India in civil misc
petitions No 20021 22 of 1986 in civil appeal No 2924/1984; and the decision dated 1541987 in the writ petition No 1483 of 1987 filed by M/s D Naveen Chandra & Company
xxx" It appears that the petitioners were not able to make imports under the said Additional licences till March 31, 1988
With effect from April 1, 1988, the Government of India issued the revised Import & Export Policy for the period April, 1988 to March 1991
The Import & Export Policy 1988 1991 also contains in para 214 and 215 provisions for grant of Additional licences to Export Houses
