You may think now that you own Him as you wish to own our land; but you cannot
was interested in a property known as the Hastings House Property and that the Taj Group of Hotels who considered the Hastings House property unsuitable may be offered four acres out of the eight acres of Begumbari land
On January 7, 1982, there was a joint meeting of the Establishment and Finance sub committees of the Zoo and it was decided to recommend to the Committee of management that the demarcated area of four acres may be relinquished in favour of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services Department subject to the requirement that the Zoo will continue to get the services and facilities in the existing structures until they were reconstructed on the adjacent land
These persons and institutions had made several points, none of which had been taken into account by the Government before it took the decision to lease the land
Shri Dipankar Gupta, learned counsel for the Taj Group of Hotels and Shri Gooptu learned counsel for the State of West Bengal argued that the former facilities available in the four arce plot of land were not displaced but were replaced and preserved by better facilities in the adjacent plot of land
It was suggested that the Government may consider abandoning the proposal to set up a hotel on the Eastern side of the Zoo
The learned counsel for the appellants urged that the second Cabinet Memorandum dated September 9, 1981 on which date the Government took the final decision to grant the lease made no mention of the needs and interests of the Zoo or the facilities provided in the Begumbari land for the Zoo
In the meanwhile, WEBCON, a West Bengal Government Consultancy Undertaking, was asked to examine the proposals and to advise the Government
On January 11, 1982 the Managing Committee endorsed the view of the sub committees and this was communicated to the Government
Ini tially the relief sought was primarily to restrain the Zoo authorities from giving effect to the two resolutions dated January 7, 1982 and January 11, 1982 to hand over the four acres to the Animal Husbandry Department of the Government
It is this giving away of land, that was challenged before the High Court and is now challenged in this Court in this appeal by two citizens of Calcutta, one of them the Secretary of the Union of workmen of the zoological garden and the other a life 243 member of the zoo, both of whom claiming to be lovers of wild life and well wishers of the zoo
In the face of all this material, we do not see how it can be seriously contended that the interests and the requirements of the Zoo were totally ignored and not kept in mind when the decision was taken to lease the land to the Taj Group of Hotels
, The last and final submission of the learned counsel for the appellants relates to the commercial and financial aspects of the lease
Tata, a copy of which has been placed before us
We do not have the original grant before us
Regarding the commercial and financial aspects of the lease also there is nothing secretive though they came in for sharp criticism at the hands of the appellants before us
We are unable to agree with the submission of Dr Singhvi, learned counsel for the appellants, that the Gov ernment of West Bengal decided to grant the lease of the Begumbari land to the Taj Group of Hotels without applying their mind to very important relevant considerations
Several authorities and insti tutions like the Director of the Zoo, the Managing Committee of the Zoo, the Public Undertakings Committee of West Ben gal, the Indian Wild Life Board, leading ornithologists of the country, etc
Still, we did not have before us any of their grievances ventilated, which, if there were any, we would have willingly considered
The Chief Minister 's attention was expressly drawn to the Managing Committee 's first Resolution expressing its opposition to the proposal to give the land for the construction of a hotel and detailing the objections and the Chief Minister had expressly noted that all facili ties necessary for the Zoo would be provided by the Govern ment
The area proposed to be taken for Hotel construction is already used by the zoo for fodder cultivation, burial ground for dead animals, animal hospital, operation theater, quarantine area, segrega tion wards, postmortem room and nursery both for zoo animals and horticultural section
An affidavit to that effect was also filed before the trial court
In their writ petition or in course of their submissions before us the appellants did not try to make out a case of personal malice against the State Government or its Ministers and Civil Servants  
" The Division Bench held that the decision taken was neither unreasonable nor arbitrary and that taking away of four acres of land from the Zoo was not detrimental to public interest
One would have thought that the concurrent decisions of the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench, on the facts of the case, would have persuaded the appellants, to rest content with the litigation by accepting the verdicts so given
On appeal, a Division Bench of the High Court confirmed the judgment of the learned Single Judge
First a learned Single Judge dismissed the Writ Petition
The Division Bench in an equally reasoned Judgment, adverting to all the factual aspects of the case, upheld the Judgment of the learned Trial Judge and dismissed the appeal
The same five persons figured as appellants before the Division Bench
We must straightaway say that no objection was taken either before the single judge or before the Division Bench either to the authenticity or to the admissi bility of the documents
The appellants failed before the learned Trial Judge on all the points raised by them
In the result, the judgments of the learned single judge and the Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court are affirmed and the appeal is dismissed
Did the Act deal with the land at all?
Section 3 unables the State Government, by notification in the official Gazette "to declare that any specified land, bridge or pontoon shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to be included 266 in any park "
3, it does not mean that the land has become the property of the park; it only means that the various things, the doing of which is regulated or prohibited by the Act and the rules will not be done or will be regulated on the adjacent land also
We do not think that the provisions of the Bengal Public Parks Act have any relevance to the question of the power of the Government to transfer the Begumbari land to the Taj Group of Hotels
"As per clause 11 of the Alipore Zoological Garden (Management) Rules, 1957, the disposal of properties and funds are vested in the Managing Committee of he Garden
(4) post mortem room for carrying out pm findings, (5) dumping ground for dumping huge garbages coming out of the Zoo daily, (6) fodder cultivation area for growing fodder for the harbivorous animals and (7) pathological laboratory for carrying pathological tests of animals and birds
This was noticed and mentioned in the note prepared for the consideration of the Cabinet and it was suggested that separate provision would have to be made for them
Like similar volumes going by whatever name, pub lished by the Boards of Revenue of other States, the West Bengal Land Management Manual also is compendium of (1) statutes and rules framed either by the Government or by the Board of Revenue pursuant to a statutory power conferred on them; (2) Orders issued by the Government from time to time; and (3) Orders, circulars, instructions and memoranda issued by the Board of Revenue from time to time
This method was also subject to criticism by the appellants ' counsel and he in support of his submission handed over to us a calcula tion, which according to me, betrays unawareness with the method of calculation to be adopted in similar cases
There is infact no provision which deals with the vesting of property in a park
The Chief Minister further drew the attention of the Prime Minister to the fact that the hotel was likely to be a six storeyed one and would not be the only tail building near the Zoo
In fact, as the grounds of the zoo between the lake and Belvedre Road are covered with high trees, the climbing or descent angle which the birds have to negoti ate to get over the trees is already steeper that it will be between the lake and the proposed hotel
The next question is whether the Government was alive to the ecological considerations, particularly to the question of the migratory birds when they took the decision of lease the land to the Taj Group of Hotels
The Chief Minister was certainly aware of the question of the migratory birds before it was finally decided to allot the Begumbari land to the Taj Group of Hotels
The question raised in the present case is whether the Government of West Bengal has shown such lack of awareness of the problem of environment in making an 242 allotment of land for the construction of a Five Star Hotel at the expense of the zoological garden that it warrants interference by this Court?
The land allotted to the hotel was, as we have seen, not used for the main purpose of the 260 zoo and was not in fact part of the main Zoological Garden
272 In Ram & Shyam Company vs State of Haryana (supra) dealing with the question of disposal of State property Desai, J speaking for the court said, "Let us put into focus the clearly demarcated approach that distinguishes the use and dis posal of private property and socialist property
It was said that the principles of Natural Justice had not been observed and that those who are most interested in the Zoological Garden were not heard in the matter before the decision was taken
In fact, as we have seen, the matter had been considered and approved by the Cabinet itself and all Departments must necessarily have been appraised of the proposal
2 & 3 are the life members of the Zoo and the remaining two, bona fide residents of Greater Calcutta and lovers of wild life
On June 9, 1981, the Secretary of the Animal Husbandary and Veterinary Services Department complained to the Secre tary of the Metropolitan Development Department that they were not aware of the decision to lease the Begambari land
While so, the Managing Committee of the Zoo, on June 11, 1981, passed a resolution expressing itself against the proposal to construct a hotel on land belonging to the Zoo
On June 29, 1981, the Director of the Zoo wrote to the Secretary of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services Department stating his objections to the Proposal to lease the land for construction of a hotel
On February 12, 1981, the Cabinet took a decision ap proving the proposal contained in the last paragraph of the Cabinet Memorandum, thus clearing the way for negotiations with the Taj Group
It was on September 10, 1981 that the Cabinet finally took the decision to lease the Begumbari land to the Taj Group
The Bengal Parks Act, 1904 was enacted "to protect public parks and gardens in Bengal from injury and to secure the public from molestation annoyance while resorting to such parks and gardens "
On January 7, 1981 a memorandum was prepared for the consideration of the Cabinet explaining the need for more Five Star Hotels in Calcutta and the benefits flowing out of the construction and establishment of such Five Star hotels
On September 10, 1981 the Cabinet took the final decision to grant a ninety nine years lease of the Four acres of Begumbari land to the Taj Group of Hotels
The West Bengal Land Management Manual, 1977 is pub lished under the authority of the Board of Revenue, West Bengal
The WEBCON submitted its report on July 14, 1981 and on the request of the Committee of Secretaries a further report was submitted on July 22, 1981
It will be necessary and in any case advisable to shift the dumping ground, while ade quate space can be made available for growing grass else where in the same area "
This was passed by the majority of the members present, the President Justice Shri RK Banerjee dissenting
This case goes by the name "Public Interest Litigation "
In appropriate cases, the Court may go further, but how much further must depend on the circum stances of the case
The calculation handed over has no bearing to the facts of this case at all
Accordingly, I am not inclined to stay this matter any further
The Chief Minister also pointed out that the lessee and their experts on wild life has assured them that in any case adequate precaution would be taken in regard to illumination of the hotel and the layout of the surrendings so that no disturbance would be caused to the flight path of the birds or animals
On a consideration of all the facts and circumstances of the case, we are satisfied that the Government of West Bengal acted perfectly bona fide in granting the lease of Begumbari land to the Taj Group of Hotels for the construc tion of a Five Star hotel in Calcutta
It is important to note that unlike Mohinder Singh Gill 's case where that Court was dealing with a Statutory Order made by a statutory functionary who could not therefore, be allowed to supplement the grounds of this order by later explana tions, the present is a 264 case where neither a statutory functions nor a statutory functionary is involved but the transaction bears a commer cial though public character which can only be settled after protracted discussion, clarification and consultation with all interested persons
In the present case as earlier explained by us direct negotiation with these who had come forward with proposals to construct Five Star Hotels was without doubt the most reasonable and rational way of proceeding in the matter rather than invit ing tenders or holding public auction
