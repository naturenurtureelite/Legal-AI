Some disputes arose between the appellant No
On December 13, 1951, the Conciliation Officer wrote to the appellant No
On December 31, 1951, the appellant No
I was asked to appear before the Conciliation Officer on January 9, 1952, and after getting one adjournment the appellant No
The next date of hearing was January 31, 1952, and the proceedings went on till June 2, 1952, when the appellant No
On March 18, 1952, the appellant dismissed Louis Pereira, a bus conductor and proceedings were taken on a complaint by Assistant Commissioner of Labour under section 33 read with section 31 of the Act against 5 accused persons the two appellants and the partners of appellant No
The argument raised on behalf of the appellant is that the object of conciliation is to get a settlement made with expedition and therefore under section 12 the Conciliation Officer was bound to make his report within 14 days of the commencement of the conciliation proceedings or within such shorter period fixed by the appropriate Government
It was next contended that on this interpretation the conciliation proceedings could be prolonged much beyond what was contemplated by the Act and the termination would depend upon how soon a report is received by the appropriate Government
He is required to bring about settlement between the parties and must begin his investigation without delay and if no settlement is arrived at he is to submit his report to the appropriate Government
