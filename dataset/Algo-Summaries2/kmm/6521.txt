549 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by RANGANATHAN, J
A very interesting question comes up for consideration in this appeal
The question to be ultimately decided falls within a very narrow compass but it is neces sary to set out the facts leading to the present appeal at some length
The property, which is the subject matter of the present dispute, originally formed part of an extent of land situat ed on Mount Road, Madras, bearing door Nos 2 and 3 and measuring 41 grounds and 2005 sq
It belonged to several co owners
These co owners had leased out the properties under two lease deeds in favour of M/s India Automobiles, which was then the sole proprietary concern of one of them selves, Ganshyamdas Girdhardas (GG), but was converted subsequently, in 1961, into a partnership concern of GG and his four sons
The firm and its partners arc hereinafter compendiously referred to as 'the tenants '
The first lease (Ext
P 1) was dated 229
1947 and related to Door No 2 (Item No1 in Schedule A to the plaint)
This was a property comprising of an area of 4 grounds and 151 square feet with certain buildings thereon
The rent for the premises was Rs 150 per month
The second lease deed (Ext
P 2), dated 310
1947 relating to Door No 3 (Item 2 in Schedule A to the plaint) covered an area of 8700 sq
and some building thereon
The rent as per lease deed was Rs200 per month
On 3071953, all the co owners of the property (includ ing GG) sold the property to the United India Life Assur ance Company and the New Guardian of India Life Insurance Company Ltd In 1956, the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) stepped into the shoes of these two insurance companies and became the owner of the property
On 20765, the LIC moved two applications (being HRC Nos 3310 and 3311 of 1965) in the court of the Rent Con troller (Sri A Varadarajan who later became a Judge of the this Court) for fixation of a "fair rent" for each of the premises
The fair rent claimed was computed at Rs2,39903 per month in respect of item No 1 as against the rent of Rs 150 pm fixed under the lease deed
In respect of item 2 the fair rent claimed was Rs326650 as against Rs200 pm payable under the lease deed
The defendants (GG and his sons) filed their objections to the above applications
They claimed that, under both the lease deeds, what had been leased out to them was only a vacant land and that the superstructure had been built by them
They claimed, there fore, that they were entitled to relief under the Madras 550 City Tenants ' Protection Act and that the Rent Controller Court had no jurisdiction to fix a fair rent
The Rent Controller accepted the above argument so far as item was concerned
So far as item 2 was concerned, it appears that, at the time of the hearing, it was conceded before the Rent Controller that the respondents were tenants of the entire properties covered by the lease deed and that they had not constructed any of the premises thereupon
In view of this the Rent Controller dismissed HRC 3310/ 65 relating to item No 1 and, in HRC 3311/65, fixed the fair rent in respect of item No 2 at Rs 1451 pm
The order of the Rent Controller was dated 93
There were appeals to the Court of Small Causes
In respect of item No 1, in HRA 534/66, the Court, on a perusal of the sale deed dated 30753 filed by the LIC before it, came to the conclusion that the buildings on the land leased under exhibit P 1 had also been conveyed to the LIC and that the LIC was entitled to seek fixation of fair rent in respect of this premises also
The fair rent fixed by the Rent Controller at Rs994 pm was upheld
The order of the Rent Controller in respect of item 2 was also upheld
It may be mentioned here that, even in certain earlier proceedings for fixation of fair rent and eviction (HRC 867/73 and HRC 2557/64), it had been held by the Rent Controller that item No 1 (door No 2) belonged to the LIC but his order of eviction had been set aside by the appellate court on some other ground
In the circumstances, the Court of Small Causes, in the appeals now being referred to (HRA
534/66), did not treat the earlier decision as res judicata but came independently to the same conclusion that item No 1 belonged to the LIC
This was on 19th April, 1967
The tenants filed revision petitions against the order of the Court of Small Causes but these were dismissed on 20111968
After the Civil Revision Petitions by the tenant were dismissed, the LIC filed CS 64/1969 on the original side of the Madras High Court against the tenants for recovery of arrears of rent on the basis of the fair rents fixed, which were computed at Rs98,25097 in respect of the two items of property
Further interest at the rate of 12% thereon from date of plaint to the date of decree and at 6% thereafter till the date of realisation was also claimed
It may be mentioned here that the tenant filed CS 87 of 1972 claiming protection under the Madras City Tenants ' Protection Act but this suit and further appeals therefrom have been dismissed
Turn 551 ing now to CS No 54 of 1969 (which was disposed of along with CS No 87 of 72 by a common judgment dated 23101972), the contention urged on behalf of the tenants was that, since the subject matter of the lease under exhibit P 1 was only a vacant site, the Rent Controller had no juris diction to fix the fair rent in respect thereof and that, therefore, the claim in the suit for arrears of rent, based on the Rent Controller 's order in respect of the premises covered by exhibit P 1 had to fail
The Court addressed itself to this question
It came to the conclusion that exhibit P 1 did not, in law, create a valid lease between the co owners and the tenants
After referring to the terms of the sale deed (exhibit P 3), the superstructure constructed on the land was held to have been conveyed to the vendee under the sale deed dated 30 7 1953 and to have thus vested in the LIC
The Rent Controller was, therefore, held to have had juris diction to fix the fair rent in respect of the premises
It was, therefore, held that the plantiff 's claim in the suit should succeed
The suit was decreed accordingly
The tenants filed an appeal being OSA No 62 of 1973
The Appellate Bench confirmed the decree in respect of item No 2 subject to certain modifications which are not here relevant
However, so far as item No 1 was concerned, the Appellate Bench vacated the decree passed by the trial court
It held that there was a valid tease between the quondam owners and the tenants under Exts
P 1 & P 2
Having regard to the express recitals in exhibit P 3, the Appellate Bench held that it was impossible to hold that the build ings, which admittedly belonged to the defendants and had been constructed by them on the vacant land taken on lease under exhibit P 1, ever were or could be the subject matter of the sale under exhibit p 3
In view of this finding, it was held that the Rent Controller had no jurisdiction to entertain the application for fixation of fair rent in respect of the property which was only a vacant piece of land
In conse quence, it was held, the LIC could not maintain the suit for recovery of rent based on the order made by the statutory tribunal under the Rent Control Act and claim the difference between the so called fair rent and the contract rent
The claim of the LIC for recovery of Rs39,22471, as arrears of rent, in respect of item 1 was thus held to be not maintain able
OSA 62 of 1973 was, therefore, allowed to that extent
The present appeal, by Special Leave granted on 37
1979, is from the order of the Division Bench rejecting the appellant 's claim for arrears of rent in respect of item No 1 of the property set out in Schedule A to the plaint based on the difference between the fair rent fixed by the Rent Controller and the rent payable therefore under exhibit P 1
