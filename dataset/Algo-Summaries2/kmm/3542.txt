The letter in question was addressed by the deponent to the President of India with copies to others with the sole object of conveying the opinion that the public expression by the Hon 'ble Judge of his personal views on controversial political matters con cerning the merits and demerits of the present system of the Government was not in keeping with the well accepted role of proverbial aloofness of a Judge
The elementary basis of acceptance of apology is that there is to be a finding of committal of contempt
In view of the fact that the High Court proceeded on the basis that the allegations in the letter were unchallenged we are of opinion that the matters did not constitute any contempt
We should state here that the Advocate General of Haryana quite fairly stated that the letter did not consti tute any contempt
These are appeals under section 19(1)(b) of the against the judgment and order dated 1 December, 1975 of the Full Bench of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana
The deponents stated that if the Court is of the view that the letter of the deponents constitute for any reason contempt of court, the deponents tender apology
Then the Honourable Judge turned down the request and replied that it is never possible in the present system of Government of India
In that letter they further stated as follows: "The learned Judge met the members of the Bar on 15 February, 1975 in the Bar Room, Bhiwani
Tewatia and urge the Government to take appropriate action in this regard"
