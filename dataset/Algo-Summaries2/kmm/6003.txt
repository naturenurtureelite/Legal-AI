It is now n ot disputed that the appellants of this appeal have in purs u ance of the order of this Court dated 2nd February, 19 81 been given a back date promotion to the post of Chargeman II synchronising with the dates of completion of their 2 yea rs of service as Supervisor 'A '
According to learn ed counsel the Rules did not prescribe the minimum number of years of service as Supervisors 'A ' which would make th em eligible for promotion as Chargeman II and the circul ar dated 6th November, 1962 which was in the nature of an executive instruction prescribed 2 years ' service as Supe r visor 'A ' to make him eligible for promotion
9357 of 1983 also namely that the responden ts may be restrained from promoting officers to the next high er posts on the basis of recommendations of certain Departme n tal Promotion Committees without complying with the dire c tions of this Court in its order dated 2nd February, 198 1
Moreover, we do not think any case, on t he basis of violation of Article 16 of the Constitution can be found in favour of the appellant petitioners only becau se some 99 supervisors, equally placed, were promoted against the rul es of service
If a large number of other persons similar ly situated have been promoted as Chargeman Grade II aft er completing two years of service, there is no reason why t he appellants should also not be similarly promoted aft er completing the same period of service
In paragraph 2(i) it has be en stated that during 1962 63 due to sudden expansion of Or d nance Factories Organisation in the wake of Chinese aggre s sion a large number of posts of Chargeman 11 and other pos ts were created and as a result thereof persons already in service as Supervisors 'A ' were promoted to the posts of Chargeman II on completion of 2 years ' service
It h as further been stated therein that after the newly creat ed posts were thus filled by promotion, chances of promotion of those who were appointed subsequently diminished and f or want of sufficient number of 108 vacancies as Chargeman II they could not be promoted to th at post soon after the completion of 2 years ' service
a person will not be entitled to any p ay and allowance during the period for which he did not perfo rm the duties of a higher post although after due considerati on he was given a proper place in the gradation list havi ng deemed to be promoted to the higher post with effect fr om the date his junior was promoted
Its only effect was that t he chance of promotion which had been accelerated by the circ u lar dated 6th November, 1962 was deferred and made depende nt on selection according to the Rules
441 of 19 81 vide its order dated 2nd February, 1981
the leg al position pointed out above the aforesaid circular could n ot be treated to be one affecting adversely any condition of service of the Supervisors 'A '
Howeve r, merely on completion of two years ' service a Supervisor ' A ' could not claim automatic promotion
It appears that a lar ge number of persons have been promoted to those posts thou gh they have completed only two years of service
The Gover n ment now appears to insist that in so far as the appellan ts are concerned they cannot be considered for promotion unle ss they complete three years of service
A rule which merely affects chances of promoti on cannot be regarded as varying a condition of service
Learned counsel for the petitioners contended that t he reason which weighed with this Court in allowing Civ il Appeal No
Rule 12 provides 104 that no appointment to the posts to which these rules app ly shall be made otherwise than, as specified in these rule section This right of promotion as provided by the Rules was neith er affected nor could be affected by the circular
"Our attention has been invited by learned counsel for bo th the sides to the relevant rules which govern promotion to the post of Chargeman Grade II
We see no force in this argument becau se chances of promotion are not conditions or service "
Having heard learned counsel for the parties we fi nd substance in the submission made by the learned counsel f or the respondents
T he learned Single Judge, however, did not go into the merits of the controversy and dismissed the writ petition on t he ground of unexplained laches and also on the ground that a previous petition for similar relief had not been presse d Against the 98 judgment of the learned Single Judge the appellants pr e ferred a special appeal before a Division Bench of th at Court
While repelling this submission the Constituti on Bench held: "All that happened as a result of making promotions to t he posts of Deputy Collectors divisionwise and limiting su ch promotions to 50 per cent of the total number of vacanci es in the posts of Deputy Collector was to reduce the chanc es of promotion available to the petitioners
This was an argument, neither pleaded as a ground for the petition nor was raised before the learn ed Single Judge
The learned Judges who decided the special appeal d id not consider it appropriate to uphold the dismissal of t he writ petition on the technical ground which found favo ur with the learned Single Judge and they went into the meri ts of the respective contentions of the parties
[109F] & ORIGINAL JURISDICTION: Writ Petition (Civil) No
They are as hereunder: "(i) pass appropriate orders directing the respondents to implement in true letter and spirit, the judgment of th is Hon 'ble Court dated 221981 in Civil Appeal No
(ii) All those Diploma holders who work satisfactorily as Supervisor 'A ' (Tech) or in equivalent grades for 2 years in Ordnance Factory should be promoted to Chargeman
441 of 1 98 1; (ii) issue appropriate directions commanding the responden ts to promote the appellants to the next higher posts of Chargeman Grade I, Assistant Foreman, and Foreman, wi th effect from the date they are entitled to, after giving th em the benefit of the directions of this Hon 'ble Court dat ed 221981; (iii) issue appropriate directions to the respondents to give all consequential benefits to the appellants, includi ng payment of arrears "
It is thus apparent that an executive instruction cou ld make a provision only with regard to a matter which was n ot covered by the Rules and that such executive instructi on could not override any provision of the Rule
This right was co n ferred by Rule 7 which inter alia provides that subject to the exception contained in Rule 11, vacancies in the pos ts enumerated therein will normally be filled by promotion of employees in the grade immediately below in accordance wi th the provisions of Rule 8
has decided that Diploma holders serving as 97 Supervisor 'A ' (Tech)/Supervisor 'B '/(Tech) and in equiv a lent grades should be treated as follows (i) All those Diploma holders who have been appointed as Supervisor 'B ' (Tech) (and in equivalent grades) should on completion of one year 's satisfactory service in ordnan ce factories be promoted to Supervisor 'A ' (Tech) and in equi v alent grades)
This, it was urged, affected the ir chances of promotion which were protected under the provi so to Section 115, sub section (7)
This contention was neg a tived and Wanchoo, J, (as he then was), speaking on beha lf of this Court observed: "It is said on behalf of the r e spondents that as their chances of promotion have be en affected their conditions of service have been changed to their disadvantage
441 of 1981 in t he case of Virendra Kumar and Others vs Union of India & Ors , [1981] 3 SCC Page 30 may require reconsideration, the pet i tions were directed to be placed before a three Judge Ben ch "where inter alia the correctness of the judgment could be looked into and the nature of relief available to the pet i tioners on the 101 facts now stated would also be considered "
