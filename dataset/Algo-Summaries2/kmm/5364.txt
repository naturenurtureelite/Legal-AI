The teachers then employed in those schools, thus became State employees
The Act provided for the establishment and incorporation of the Corporation
The proviso to that sub section provided that nothing contained in sub section (1) of section 11 of the Act would apply to any such employee who had by notice in writing given to the Central Government prior to September 1, 1956 intimated his intention of not becoming an employee of the Corporation
The whole time employees of the erstwhile insurers whose services were thus transferred to the Corpo ration are hereinafter referred to as 'the transferred employees ' of the Corporation
Provided further that during the three years, beginning from 1st September, 1956, the Executive Committee may, at its discretion, extend the service of a class I employee, who has completed sixty years of age for such period as may be specified but not exceeding one year at a time if such extension is considered necessary in the inter est of the Corporation
The sub section envisages alteration by the Corporation
There is provision for the transfer of the assets and liabilities pertaining to the business, of provident funds, 206 superannuation and other like funds, of the services of existing employees of insurers to the Corporation and also of the services of existing employees of chief agents of the insurers to the Corporation, and finally for the payment of compensation to the insurers for the transfer of the busi ness to the Corporation
Already 30 years have elapsed from the date of the establishment of the Corporation
The Government and the Corporation felt that the services 16 persons who were working in the Department of Insurance were required by the Corporation
The resignation of those 16 persons from the service of the Government of India was accepted on 15th March, 1966 and from that date those per sons became the employees of the Corporation
It, therefore became necessary to bring about uniformity in the conditions of service of the transferred employees
On the absorption of the services of the servants of the previous railway companies it became necessary for the Indian Railway Administration to frame rules with regard to their conditions of service including the determination of the age of retirement of those railway employees
The above regulation fixed the age of retirement of an employee at 55 years while empowering the authority to extend the service of an employee, at its discretion, every year upto 60 years of age
Out of those 16, 13 have already retired from service on attaining the age of 60 years
We do not also find much substance in the contention of the 1st Respondent that there cannot be any discrimination as regards the age of retirement between the employees belonging to Class I and Class II on the one hand and Class III and Class IV on the other
In other words the contention of the 1st Respondent before the High Court was that since he had the fight to continue in service if he had remained in Class III only till he attained the age of 60 years as a Class III employee by virtue of the settlement and the amendment of the regula tion 19 in the year 1965, the age of retirement in his case could not be reduced to 58 years only because he had been promoted to a Class I post
Most of the insurers permitted their officers to continue in service upto 60 years of age and even beyond, depending upon their efficiency
We have given extracts from the above decisions which are fairly long since they relate to the identical provi sions of law and also cover a large part of the arguments urged before us
; , in support of his case before us
Petitioners have contended that the disparity in the age of retirement between two groups of employees gives rise to discriminatory treatment
It accordingly held that the 1st Respondent was entitled to continue till he attained the age of 60 years as other Class I employees belonging to the category of transferred employees
Ltd, directed the retirement age of the clerical staff of the Refinery Division of respondent 1 to be fixed at 60 years
Even the High Court in the instant case accepts that it was just and proper to extend the benefit of the higher age of retirement to the trans ferred employees but it has held that when once a trans ferred employee is promoted he would lose the right to a special treatment as regards the age of superannuation
The longitudinal division of the employees was as follows
The Court, therefore, held that the notification was discriminatory
All life, including administrative life, involves experiment, trial and error, but within the leading strings of fundamental rights, and, absent unconstitutional 'exces ses ', judicial correction is not right
In the Workmen case itself, this Court did not extend the benefit of super annuation at the age of 60 to all clerical staff but limited the same to that category of employees working in the Refin ery Division, Bombay
That decision was rendered in an appeal against an award passed by an Industrial Tribunal
The two decisions, referred to above, have been rendered by two different Division Benches
Hence in order to remove all doubts the President of India promulgated an ordinance (which was replaced by Act 17/1957) substituting a new sub section in the place of the original sub section (2) of section II of the Act making it more comprehensive and thus enabling the Central Government to alter suitably all conditions of service of the transferred employees
Sub section (2) of section 11, by its first limb, confers power on the Central Government to alter the scales of remuneration and other terms and conditions of service applicable to transferred employees
There is no danger of an order made by the Central Government under the second limb of sub section (2) in respect of transferred employees being struck down on the ground that it violates the equality provisions of Part 111 of the Constitution because similar action has not been taken in respect of newly recruited employees
By virtue of section 7 of the Act on the appointed day all the assets and liabilities appertaining to the controlled business of all insurers, the management of which it had been taken over earlier by the Central Govern ment, stood transferred to and vested in the Corporation
Transfer of service of existing employees of insurers to the Corporation (1) Every whole time employee of an insurer whose controlled business has been transferred to and vested in the Corporation and who was employed by the insurer wholly or mainly in connection with his controlled business immediately before the appointed day shall, on and from the appointed day, become an employee of the Corporation, and shall hold his office therein by the same tenure, at the same remuneration and upon the same terms and conditions and with the same rights and privi leges as to pen 190 sion and gratuity and other matters as he would have held the same on the appointed day if this Act had not been passed, and shall continue to do so unless and until his employ ment in the Corporation is terminated or until his remuneration, terms and conditions are duly altered by the Corporation: Provided that nothing contained in this sub section shall apply to any such employee who has, by notice in writing given to the Central Government prior to the ap pointed day, intimated his intention of not becoming an employee of the Corporation
Under regulation 21 of the (Staff) Regulations, 1956 provision was made regarding superannuation and retirement of the employ ees of the Corporation
Clause 13 of the above Order, therefore, modified regu lation 21 of the (Staff) Regulations, 1956 to the extent indicated therein with effect from the commencement of the Corporation
Regula tion 19 of the (Staff) Regulations, 1960 dealt with the subject of superannuation and retirement of the employees of the Corporation
Explanation: The compensation payable to an employ ee under this sub section shall be in addition to and shall not affect any pension, gratuity, provident fund money or any other benefit to which the employee may be entitled under his contract of service
In Christopher Pimenta and Others vs Life Insurance Corporation of India, the High Court of Bombay opined that under section 11(2) of the Act the Central Government could alter the terms and conditions of service of the employees only as to the remuneration and that the said sub section had no reference to the other terms and conditions of the service
It should be stated at the outset that some of the questions raised before us are already covered by pronounce ments made by this Court
Bahadur & Ors, ; which unfortunately was not brought to the notice of the High Court
vs The State of Haryana & Ors, ; The facts of that case were these
vs The State of Haryana & Ors, (supra) appointed in the local bodies Schools before 'provincialisation ', challenged the validity of the 1961 Rules
We do not find any substance in the argument urged on behalf of the 1st Respondent rely ing upon the judgment of this Court in Roshan Lal Tandon vs Union of India; , which lays down that when employees are 214 recruited to a lower grade from two sources no favourable treatment should be extended to recruits from one source on their promotion to the higher grade
By making the above observation this Court has virtually accepted the position that when there are special circumstances justifying the difference, it is open to fix different ages of retirement for the employees of an establishment in appropriate cases
In Govindarajulu vs The Management of Union Bank of India & Ors, (Writ Petition No
On appeal, the judgment of the High Court was affirmed by this Court in Railway Board vs A Pitchumani (supra)
v The State of Haryana & Ors
We may at this stage refer to a recent decision of this Court in Miss Lena Khan vs Union of India and Ors
It is true that originally employees belonging to Class III and Class IV categories amongst the transferred employees were given the benefit of retirement at the age of 60 years but the employees belong ing to Class III and Class IV categories recruited after 1st September, 1956 were required to retire on the completion of 58 years of age
Hence, he was not retired on the 30th June, 1984 as originally notified and allowed to continue in service
As already seen, ever since 1937 and even before, the two categories of teachers have always remained distinct, governed by different sets of rules, recruited by different authorities and having, otherwise than in the matter of pay scales and qualifications, differ ent conditions of service
1 of his retirement which was due on 30th June, 1984 on his completing the age of 58 years
6849 of 1984 on the file of the High Court of Allahabad questioning the validity of regulation 19(2) of the (Staff) Regulations, 1960 as it stood then and praying for the issue of a writ in the nature of mandamus to the Corporation not to retire him before he completed the age of 60 years
It was only in 1965 under the settlement the age of retirement of employees in Class III and Class IV who joined service after September 1, 1956 was raised to 60 years
A ministerial railway servant who entered Government service on or before the 31st March, 1938 and held on that date (i) a lien or a suspended lien on a permanent post, or 219 (ii) a permanent post in a provision al substantive capacity under Clause (d) of Rule 2008 and continued to hold the same without interruption until he was confirmed in that post, shall be retained in service till the day he attains the age of sixty years
He was asked to retire from service on April 14, 1968 on which date he was completing the age of 58 years
On a careful consideration of all 223 the aspects of the case we feel that the High Court erred in striking down regulation 19(2) of the (Staff) Regulations, 1960 as amended in the year 1977, and in directing the Corporation to continue the 1st Respondent in its service till he completed the age of 60 years
All the employees belonging to Class III and Class IV irrespective of the fact whether they were transferred employees or employees appointed after 1st September, 1956 were entitled to continue in service till 60 years of age, but the employees belonging to Class I and Class II, who were appointed to the service of the Corpora tion on or after 1st September, 1956 had to retire on the completion of 58 years of age subject to the usual clause relating to premature retirement
These employees demanded that their age of retirement should also be fixed at 60 years as in the case of Class III and Class IV employ ees belonging to the category of transferred employees
In the case of those 16 people the Corporation passed a separate order fixing their age of retirement as 60 years having regard to the negotiations which had taken place between the Corporation and the Government before the taking over of their services by the Corporation
In the amended Regulations approved by the Board, this provi sion of the Standardisation Order was incorporated as far as employees in Classes III & IV are concerned but in the case of transferred officers and Field Officers, the retirement age was fixed at 55 extensible to 58 with a further proviso that in special circumstances only the competent authority may extend the services 197 beyond age 58 and upto 60 years of age
In the case of the transferred employees the regula tion was in conformity with the standardisation order passed in respect of Class III and Class IV transferred employees in whose case the age of retirement was fixed at 60 years
It is not, therefore, liable to be upset by a decision of the Court
We, therefore, set aside the judgment of the High Court and dismiss the writ petition filed in the High Court
The fixation of 60 years as the age of superan nuation in the case of transferred employees cannot be considered to be unreasonable in view of the history of this case
This decision has no relevance to the present case although the High Court has relied on it in deciding this case
It has to be observed in the case before us also that the transferred employees belong to a diminishing cadre
As regards new recruits, it was thought that there was no justification to bring down the retirement age from 60 to 55 all of a sudden nor was it considered necessary to maintain any distinction between officers and staff
