The Act itself lays down a proce dure which is less advantageous to the accused than the ordinary procedure, and this fact must in all cases be the root cause of the discrimination which may result by the application of the Act
On 21st of May following, a similar application for quashing a pending criminal trial was filed by Gajen Mali, the respondent in the other appeal, who along with 5 other persons is being tried for offences of murder and conspiracy to murder before Mr M Bhattacharya, another Special Judge, appointed under the West Bengal Special Courts Act
Be that as it may, this is not the only matter upon which the normal procedure has been departed from in the Special Courts Act
It vests an unrestricted discretion in the State Government to direct any cases or classes of cases to be tried by the Special Court in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Act
It will be noticed that the sub section refers to four distinct categories, namely, "offences", ' 'classes of of fences", "cases" and "classes of cases" and empowers 339 the State government to direct any one or more of these categories to be tried by the Special Court constituted under the Act
To achieve this object, offences or cases have to be classified upon the basis of some differentia which will distinguish those offences or cases from others and which will have a reasona ble relation to the recited object of the Act
The argument is that although there is no apparent reason why an offence of theft in a dwelling house by a stranger should require speedier trial any more than an offence of theft in a dwelling house by a servant should do, the State government may nevertheless select the former offence for special and discriminatory treatment in the matter of its trial by bringing it under the Act
Further, as I have already explained, the object of the Act cannot, by itself, be the basis of the selection which, I repeat, must be based on some differentia distinguishing the ' 'case" from other ' 'cases" and having a relation to the 45 346 object of the Act
If an uncontrolled or unguided power is conferred without any reasonable and proper standards or limits being laid down in the enactment, the statute itself may be challenged and not merely the particular administrative act
The State Government may even arbitrarily determine the classes of cases to be tried by the Special Court and if it does so its action will be well within its powers conferred by the Act
As I have said already, in the present case the discrimination arises on the terms of the Act itself
Article 14 of our Constitution, it is well known, corre sponds to the last portion of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the American Constitution except that our article 14 has also adopted the English doctrine of rule of law by the addition of the words "equality before the law
This test, if accepted, will amount to adding at the end of article 14 the words "except in good faith and in the 336 general interest of administration "
It has, on the other hand, acted under that part of the section which authorises it to direct" cases" to be tried by the Special Court, for by the notifications it has directed certain specific cases identified by their individual numbers in the records of the particular than as to be tried by the Special Court
He found it" impossible to cut down the plain meaning of the word 'cases ' as used in the section"
The Court observed on the main contention that "it was competent for the legislature to lay 355 down a general rule, and then establish an administrative tribunal with authority to fix the precise width or thick ness of pillar that will suit the necessities of the partic ular situation, and constitute a compliance with the general rule"
If the statute makes no classi fication at all, or if the classification purported to be made is not reasonable or rational but is arbitrary and illusory, as in this case, Section 5 would be void as con travening article
What we have to find out is whether the statute now m question before us offends to any extent the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by our written Constitution
In my opinion, this contention cannot be accepted for more reasons than one
The learned Attorney General contended that if the object of the legislation was a laudable one and had a public purpose in view, as in this case, which provided for the speedier trial of certain offences, the fact that dis crimination resulted as a bye product would not offend the provisions of article 14
The Act is intituled "An Act to provide for the speedier trial of certain offences ", and the preamble declares that "it is expedient to provide for the speedier trial of cer tain offences "
Accordingly a Special Bench was constituted, consisting of the Chief Justice and four other Judges who heard both these cases
Turning to the pream ble, I find that the object of the Act is "to provide for the speedier trial of certain offences" and not of a partic ular case or cases
The preamble of the Act under consideration recites the expediency of providing for the speedier trial of certain 341 offences
This differentia quite clearly has a reasona ble relation to the object sought to be achieved by the Act, namely, the speedier trial of certain offences
He next refers us to the different sections of the Act and urges 340 that all the procedural changes introduced by the Act are designed to accomplish the object of securing speedier trial
In any case, there is no particular bond connecting the circumstances of the first mentioned case with the necessity for a speedier trial
The High Court by a Full Bench consisting of the Chief Justice and four other Judges quashed the conviction and directed the trial of the respondent and the other accused persons according to law
be construed as meaning cases requiring speedier trial"
The learned Attorney General urges that the principle of classification upon which the differences have been made between cases and offences triable by the Special Court and those by ordinary courts is indicated in the preamble to the Act which runs as follows: "Whereas it is expedient to provide for the speedier trial of certain offences"
The respondent and 49 other persons were charged with various offences alleged to have been committed by them in the course of their raid as an armed gang on a certain factory known as the Jessop Factory at Dum Dum, and they were convicted and sentenced to varying terms of imprison ment by the Special Court to which the case was sent for trial by the Governor of West Bengal by a notification dated 26th January, 1950, in exercise of the powers conferred by section 5 (1) of the Act
The learned Chief Justice rejected the argument that the word "cases" in the sub section should, in view of the title and preamble of the Act
On the contrary, it is to be presumed that a public authority will act honestly and reasonably in the exercise of its statutory powers, and that the State Govern ment in the present case will, before directing a case to be tried by a Special Court, consider whether there are special features and circumstances which might unduly protract its trial under the ordinary procedure and mark it off for speedier trial under the Act
The result of accepting it would be that even where discrimination is quite evident one cannot challenge the Act simply because it is couched in general terms; and one cannot also challenge the act of the executive authority whose duty it is to administer the Act, because that author ity will say : I am not to blame as I am acting under the Act
Curiously enough, what I regard as the weakest point of the Act (viz, its being drafted in such general terms) is said to be its main strength and merit, but I really cannot see how the generality of language which gives unlimited authority to discriminate can save the Act
To this general rule, however, there is an exception, which comes into play when there is evi dence of mala fides in the application of the Act
The basic question however still remains whether the Act itself is fair and good, which must be decided mainly with refer ence to the specific provisions of the Act
In my opinion, it is no classifi cation at all in the real sense of the term as it is not based on any characteristics which are peculiar to persons or to cases which are to be subject to the special procedure prescribed by the Act
It has laid down no yard stick or measure for the grouping either of persons or of cases or of offences by which measure these groups could be distinguished from those who are outside the purview of the Special Act
For the same reason I cannot agree with the learned Attorney General that in cases like these, we should enquire as to what was the dominant intention of the legislature in enact ing the law and that the operation of article 14 would be excluded if it is proved that the legislature had no inten tion to discriminate, though discrimination was the necessary consequence of the Act
The order in question laid down that it would be unlawful for any person to engage in laundry business within the corporate limits "without having first obtained the consent of the Board of Supervi sors except the same to be located in a building constructed either of brick or stone "
In the former case it was held by a majority of 5:4 that a law which denied the remedy of injunction in a dispute between employer and his ex employees was a denial of the equal protection of laws, aS such a remedy was al lowed in all other cases
It is to be observed that equality in the abstract is not guaran teed but only equality before the law
Indeed the very idea of classification is that of inequality, so that it goes without saying that the mere fact of inequality in no manner determines this matter of constitutionality"
While in Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe R Co vs Ellis (3) a Texas statute imposing an attorney 's fee in addition to costs upon railway corpora tions which unsuccessfully defended actions for damages for stock killed or injured by their train was struck down as discriminatory because such corporations could not recover any such fee if their defence was successful, a similar provision in a Kansas statute in respect of an action against railroad companies for damages by fire caused by operating the rail road was upheld as not discriminatory in Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe R
