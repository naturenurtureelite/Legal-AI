The Judgment of the Court was delivered by JAGANNATHA SHETTY, J
This appeal by special leave is from a judgment of the High Court of Allahabad dated November 6, 1985 passed in Civil Misc
Writ Petition No 4211 of 1983
The appeal raises a question of considerable importance
The question is whether it is permissible to have two pay scales in the same cadre for persons having same duties and having same responsibilities
The High Court has answered the question in the negative
It is said that it would be violative of the Constitutional right of "equal pay for equal work"
The facts are not in dispute
They will be found correctly stated in the judgment under appeal and may briefly be stated thus: Prior to 1965, in the High Court of Allahabad, Bench Secretaries were on a higher pay scale than that of Section Officers
They were in the pay scale of Rs 160 320 as against the pay scale of Rs 120 300 to Section Officers
In 1965 the State Government appointed a Pay Rationalisation Committee with wide ranging reference
The Committee was asked to consider the duties and responsibilities of different categories of posts
It was required to consider and recommend changes to reduce the number of then existing pay scales
It was also asked to recommend as far as possible equal emoluments for identical duties and responsibilities
The Committee submitted a detailed report, in which Bench Secretaries became casualties
The Committee recommended for them a pay scale slightly lower than that of Section Officers
Rs 150 350 was recommended for Bench Secretaries as against Rs200 400 for Section Officers
The State Government accepted the recommendations
Subsequently, these pay scales were raised to Rs 200 450 and Rs5 15 715 respectively
Being dissatisfied with the down grading, the Bench Secretaries made representation to the Government
They demanded that they should at least be put at par with Section Officers if not on higher scale
The High Court supported their case but half heartedly
The High Court suggested "that in view of financial exigencies the Government may grant for the time being pay scale to 10 PG NO 292 Bench Secretaries as admissible to Section Officers
" When this matter was pending consideration, the Government appointed the Pay Commission (1971 72) headed by Shri Ali Zahir
On February 1, 1973, the Pay Commission submitted its report
The report did not accept the claim of Bench Secretaries for giving them pay scale equal to Section Officers or Private Secretaries
The report was in fact very much against them
The following remarks of the Pay Commission would be pertinent: "9 Bench Secretaries (Sakna Suchiv) A memorandum from the Bench Secretaries given to us states that the post which are at present in the scale of Rs 100 450 are of a great responsibility for which experience and special qualifications are required
They have claimed that their duties are equivalent to Private Secretaries of Hon 'ble Judges and have demanded the same pay scale which is given to Private Secretaries and the Section Officers
The Registrar of the High Court while forwarding the memorandum has suggested that they should also be given the same pay scale which is given to Superintendents ie Rs515 40 715 or to the Section Officers ie Rs350 750
It is not necessary to emphasise that in comparison to Bench Secretaries, the Section Officers of the secretariat has to bear more responsibilities in their Section and have to control over its subordinates
Section Officers have to prepare a lengthy and original notes in complicated and important matters
Therefore, the responsibilities of the two posts cannot be said to be equal
Keeping in view the present scale of pay
the pay scale recommended by the Pay Rationalisation Committee, the nature of duties and responsibilities and the fact that every Hon 'ble Judge will have one Private Secretary in the scale of Rs500 1,000 we feel that the Bench Secretaries cannot be given the same scale of pay which is being given to Superintendents or the Section Officers
Since the Bench Secretaries are promoted from Upper Division Assistants, they should feel satisfied if they are placed in a scale of pay a little above the Upper Division Assistants
Therefore, we have recommended for them a pay scale of Rs400 15 475 20 575 25 750
" It will be seen that the Pay Commission refused to equate Bench Secretaries with Section Officers in view of their differential duties
It was found that the nature PG NO 293 of work of Section Officers was quite different and more onerous than that of Bench Secretaries
Section Officers have to bear more responsibilities in their Sections
They have to exercise control over their subordinate
They have to prepare lengthy original notes in complicated matters
The Commission, therefore, recommended Rs400 750 for Bench Secretaries and Rs500 1,000 to Section Officers
The Bench Secretaries again moved the Government reiterating their demand
The Government appears to have received several such representations against the report of Ali Zahir Commission
To consider all such grievances
a Committee called the "Anomalies Committee was constituted
As the name itself suggests, the Committee was required to examine and remove anomalies in the recommendations of Pay Commission
The Committee appears to have made some patch work
So far as Bench Secretaries are concerned, the Committee suggested: "(1) For this post the recommendations made by the Pay Commission need not have any amendments
(2) It should be appropriate for the Bench Secre taries to accept 10 promotional posts in the pay scale of Rs500 1,000 as recommended by the Pay Commission
" The Anomalies Committee also thus rejected the claim of Bench Secretaries for placing them at par with Section Officers
It however, suggested that ten posts of Bench Secretaries should be upgraded and placed in the pay scale of Rs
