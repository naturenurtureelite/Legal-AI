Daulatram Rameshwarlal, a firm registered under the Indian Partnership Act (referred to later in this judgment as "sellers ") are registered dealers under section 11 of the Bombay Sales Tax Act
In their return of turnover for the period from April 1, 1954 to March 31, 1955, they claimed exemption from Sales Tax in respect of sales of cotton of the total value of Rs 68,493 2 6 and sales of castor oil of the total value of Rs 6,47,509 1 6 on the ground that these sales were oil FOB contracts, under which they continued to be the owners of the goods till the goods had crossed the customs barrier and thus entered the export stream, and so no tax was realisable on these sales in view of the provisions of article 286 (1)(b)
The Sales Tax Officer rejected this claim for exemption and assessed them to sales tax on a taxable turnover including these sales
He also assessed them to purchase tax under section 10(b) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act on their purchase of castor oil which they later sold for the sum of Rs 6,47,509 1 6 as mentioned above
The notice of demand for the total sales tax and the purchase tax assessed was served on the sellers on September 30, 1956
