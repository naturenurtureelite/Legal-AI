B C Misra and P K Chakravarti, for the appellant
A number of other articles were also seized at that time but we are not concerned with them as they have no connection with the charges against the appellant
The mere fact of possession, according to learned counsel, does not suffice to show that the letters were secreted by the appellant
The next and in our opinion the most important question to be considered is whether the prosecution has established that the five registered letters in question were recovered from the possession of the appellant
Before the High Court could take into consideration the circumstance that as between himself and his father the appellant had a better opportunity to 417 get at postal articles it had to find affirmatively that the almirah was in the exclusive possession of the appellant
We may mention that Mr Mathur who appears for the State does not even suggest that the articles were stolen by the appellant
Therefore, the contention that he had an opportunity to get at the articles loses all significance and can possibly have no bearing on the question as to the nature of possession attributable to the appellant
In the circumstances we must hold that the prosecution has failed to prove that these letters were in the exclusive possession of the appellant
according to Mr Misra, the appellant cannot be said to have secreted the letter just because it was found in the almirah which is said to have been in his exclusive possession
