During the extended period of the contract conditions of service of officers shall remain same as are mentioned under their Appointment Order
The High Court further issued a direction to the effect that the respondent was entitled to salary upto the period he was entitled to remain in service
It is on this basis that the High court had while setting aside the order of termination by its order dated 2431988 directed that the respondent was entitled to salary upto the period he was entitled to remain in service and further observed that it was open for the opposite parties to consider the claim of the respondent for continu ation in service or of fresh appointment and no observations in this regard were made by the Court
The respondent aggrieved by the said order of termina tion filed a Writ Petition on the file of the High Court of Allahabad in Writ Petition No
The contention of the respondent was that the said interim order entitled him to be reinstated in service irrespective of the fact whether the Governor had extended the period of his appointment beyond 30th of August, 1985
the date of assumption if it is not terminated earlier by giving a one month 's notice by the Hon 'ble Gover nor or on paying one month 's salary in lieu thereof or by giving one month 's notice, by the Officer "
Letters of accept ance of relevant conditions of service to be obtained from these officers must be submitted to the Government at an early date "
We, however, make it clear that what we have stated above does not affect in any way what the High Court has stated in the penultimate paragraph of the Judgment dated 2431988 which reads thus: "It is open for the opposite parties to con sider the claim of the petitioner for continu ation in service or the fresh appointment and no observations in this regard are being made by this Court "
The Governor is therefore pleased to accord his sanction to extend the period of the contract upto the period mentioned under para 5 subject to the condi tion that their service tenure shall expire on completion of 58 years of age in case the same is completing earlier during the extended period
But on 2931985 the service of the 1st Respondent was terminated by the issue of a notice and payment of one month 's salary
