The Judgment of the Court was delivered by WANCHOO, J
These four appeals arise out of four certi ficates granted by the High Court of Rajasthan and raise a common question
We therefore, propose to set out facts in one of the present appeals (No 887), as the facts in other appeals are similar, except that the commodity involved was different and so was the amount in dispute
The suit out 'of which appeal No 887 has arisen was filed by the respondent against the State of Rajasthan
The respondent was a resident of the former Dholpur State and the dispute which led to the suit related to a time before the merger of former Dholpur State into the Matsya Union
The case of the respondent was that in 1947 certain commodities including chuni with which appeal No 887 is concerned could only be exported from the former Dholpur State on export permits issued by the customs department of the said State
It was also the practice in that State that when permits for export were issued, export duties had to be paid in advance, though the actual export was made later
Consequently, in June 1947 the respondent applied for and was granted a permit for export of 15,000 maunds of chuni, and in connection therewith he deposited Rs 30,000/as export duty in advance
This permit had been granted on June 28, 1947 and remained in force upto December 2, 1947
The respondent however was not able to export the entire quantity of 15,000 maunds for which the permit was granted; he could only export 4,572 maunds and 20 seers of chuni before December 2, 1947
Thereafter he could not export further as his permit was not extended
It was alleged on behalf of the respondent that the reason why he failed to export the entire 176 quantity of the commodity before December 2, 1947 was due to market conditions and inability to get allotment of railway wagons
The respondent 's case further was that as he could not export the entire quantity of 15,000 maunds for which he had paid export duty in advance at the rate of Rs 2/ per maund, he was entitled to refund of the proportionate export duty for the quantity of 10,427 maunds and 20 seers, which he could not export
His case further was that though he asked the State for refund of this advance duty, the State did not pay back the same to him
In the meantime, rapid constitutional changes took place after August 15, 1947
By May 15, 1949, the United State of Rajasthan was formed including the Matsya Union into which the former State of Dholpur had merged on March 17, 1948
The United State of Rajasthan eventually became the Part B State of Rajasthan on January 26, 1950 when the Constitution came into force
