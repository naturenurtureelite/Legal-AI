Krishnan J, stated as follows: "Where succession is by nomination by the holder in office of his successor it seems to be impossible to contend that it is a hereditary succession
The respondents, however, took a different view and proceeded on the basis that trusteeship of the Kumaran Koil was not hereditary
Ramamurthi, Vineet Kumar, L Ramamurthy and Shyamala Pappu, for the appellant
The contention on behalf of the appellant is that the succession is "regulated by usage"
According to the appellant the temple was rounded two hundred years ago by the members of his community and since then the management of the temple and is affairs was always vested in the community of the Sengunatha Mudaliars and no person other than the elected trustee had at any time the right of management and control of the temple
It is not possible to say that there is a succession of As office to another when on the efflux of the period for which A was appointed, there is a vacancy and B is elected to that vacancy
The appellant 'brought the suit in OS
The appellant was elected as a trustee by the Sengunatha Mudaliars of Manjakollai village at a meeting held on June 27, 1957
But the election to the office of trustee in the present case is for a fixed period of one year and not for life
The Subordinate Judge held that the appellant was a hereditary trustee and the suit was not barred by limitation
In Sri Mahant Paramanda Das Goswami vs Radhakrishna Das(1) the Madras High Court took the view that where succession to the mahantship is by nomination by the holder in office, it was not a hereditary succession
It is, therefore, difficult to hold that the office of the appellant is hereditary within the meaning of section 6(9) of the Act
