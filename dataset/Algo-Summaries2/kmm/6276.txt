Having regard to the depreci ation in the value of 413 the rupee and the increase in the cost of ' administration of the State, which is ever increasing, as a welfare State we cannot say that Rs7 is an unreasonably high rate
So a comparison of the relevant rules would show that a larger restriction is imposed both on the area in respect of which a Parwana could be issued and the duration of the Parwana right and as also stated that the persons who take quarrying Parwana are persons belonging to the weaker sections of society and if under rule 21 a concession is shown in their favour it cannot be said that there is no reasonable nexus between the classification for purposes of the proviso to rule 21 to show concession in the matter of payment of royalty and the social policy underlying the Constitution, the statute and the Rules
The mineral may be consumed inside the State and in some cases may latter on be taken outside the State
Many a time absence of such classi fication may itself result in the invalidation of the law or rule
It is no doubt true that the Act is passed for devel opment of minerals, but while discharging its functions relating to development, if the State incidentally allows mining to be carried on in the public interest and levies in that connection a tax, it does not mean that the said tax should be used only for development of minerals and not for other purposes sanctioned by law
The minerals belong to the Government and if anybody wants to have the right as a lessee to exploit the mines in question to the exclusion of all others and to remove the minerals with a view to making profit, he has to pay a royalty imposed in accordance with law
Nariman, learned counsel for the petitioners in some of the petitions had two contentions: 1 that the royalty levied and covered under the Rules should be applied only for mineral development and since the said royalty is being treated as part of the consolidated fund of the State and used for other purposes by the State the levy was bad; and 2
that the impugned notification in question was in contravention of clause (b) of Article 304 of the Constitution
During the pendency of the said petitions in the High Court the impugned notification was issued increasing the royalty payable in respect of Black Trap and Hard Murrum from Rs4 to Rs7
Any tax realised by the State Government forms part of the consolidated fund of the State and the said tax can be used by the State Government for any of the purposes to which its executive powers extend subject to any law made by the State Legislature in that regard
Whoever is given an exclusive right to exploit a mine will have to pay some amount by way of return to the Govern ment of India as authorised by entry 50 of List II of the 7th Schedule to the Constitution
Section 15 as it stood during the relevant time read thus: "15
He depended upon the language of Entry 50 which reads thus: "taxes on mineral rights subject to any limitations imposed by Parliament by law relating to mineral development" We do not find much substance in this contention
We find no substance in this contention too
We do not, therefore, find any substance in the contention urged by Shri Nariman
