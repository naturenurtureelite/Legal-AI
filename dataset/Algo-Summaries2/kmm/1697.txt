There is no warrant for the view for which the appellant contended, that only the terms on which the business under the document of December 6, 1918 was carried were revoked and not the head agreement to do business in partnership
Furthermore, for the reasons earlier stated, it must be held that on April 1, 1939 the business, assuming its identity to have continued in spite of the splitting up, was being carried on by two persons, namely, two firms with different partners
hereinafter called the Partners witnesseth as follows: Whereas under the Agreement of Partnership dated the 6th day of December 1918 (1) Purushotham (2) Nagjee
Indeed the instrument of October 30, 1943 which brought the transferor firm, the appellant before us, into existence, expressly states that "The Agreements of Partnerships dated 30th May 1939
are hereby revoked"
The last instrument to which we have to refer is the agreement of February 7, 1948 between Maneklal, Jayanand, Leeladhar and Prabhulal as partners of the appellant firm and a limited company formed to take over the business
(2) The Agreement of Partnership dated the 6th day of December 1918 is hereby revoked and the affairs of the Firm shall be regulated and governed by the Regulations agreed upon orally and reduced into writing in this Deed and the terms and conditions of the revoked deed shall not in future apply to the 'Firm ' except such as have been repeated in this Deed
The appellant, who is the assessee in these cases, is a firm
Then we get two instruments both dated May 30, 1939, each described as an agreement of partnership
Chief Justice Chagla observed at p 287 thus: "But before us we have a clear and categorical finding that the three businesses of the assessee were distinct businesses and, therefore, it cannot be stated that the relief which was intended for the money lending business which was carried on by the assessee and which was subjected to tax under t he Act of 1918 should be extended to the business of running the ginning factory and the share business which were not in existence and which were not subjected to tax under the Act of 1918
Where any such claim is made, an assessment shall be made on the basis of the income, profits and gains of the said period, and if an amount of tax has already been paid in respect of the income, profits and gains of the previous year exceeding the amount payable on the basis of such assessment, a refund shall be given of the difference "
That clause states that the partners in their individual capacity would be partners with Hemchand in another business the terms of which partnership appear in another partnership agreement of the same date and which is annexure C 1
It is necessary at this stage to read section 25 which deals with assessment in case of discontinued business
Section 25 provides for discontinu ance of business
As regards the words "discontinued" and "discontinuance" in section 25, Lord Simonds pointed out that they had been the subject of numerous decisions and that it had been uniformly decided that the words did not cover a mere change of ownership but referred only to complete cessation of the business
The claim for relief under that section must fail on this ground also
The contention of the respondent, on the other hand, is that these two instruments show that the business of the existing firm had been split up into two and transferred to two different owners, namely, two newly constituted firms with different partners, some of whom were no doubt common, and this amounted to a discontinuance of the business of the old firm
This position is reinforced by the terms of annexure C 11
15,000 as deposit in the Firm of Sait Nagjee Purushotham & Co, Bankers, Piece goods and Yarn Merchants, Calicut and such money shall remain in deposit as long as he remains a Partner and such amount shall carry interest at such rates of interest as the Firm of Sait Nagjee Purushotham & Co, Bankers, Piecegoods and Yarn Merchants may agree from time to time "
123 meaning of the section and to be in line with similar deci sions upon the English Income Tax Acts "
1, 2 and 3 in writing the Partnership, shall not borrow any amount from any one other than the Firm Sait Nagjee Purushotham & Co, Bankers, Piece goods and Yarn merchants referred to in para 8 above
The Tribunal also held that the business in soap and umbrella was different from the business of banking, piece goods and yarn, and the amalgamation of these two businesses in 1943 amounted to a succession by a newly constituted firm
The Tribunal duly drew up a statement of case and referred the question along with it to the High Court
The learned Judge held that there was discontinuance
Satyanarayana Rao, J held that as the unit had disintegrated into its component parts so as to annihilate the unity of the business, each part which was thus divided was not identical with the whole, even though all the parts taken together constituted the whole and that, when the unifying principle of that whole no longer existed, the parts gained their individuality and became separate and distinct
There were really two references as there were two cases before the Tribunal
The claim was rejected by the Income tax Officer and by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and also by the Income tax Appellate Tribunal on appeal to it
(25) all the parties to annexure C I agreed that the firm constituted by Nagjee, Narayanjee and Maneklal was a different firm
Now the person who transferred the business which caused the succession in 1948 on which the appellant relies for relief under section 25(4), was a single firm
(25) All the Partners hereby agree that Partners
(20) All the partners hereby agree that they in their individual capacity are and shall be Partners also along with Hemchand Veerjee Sait in a Partnership business in Soaps and Umbrellas carried on in Calicut and Madras under the name and style of Sait Nagjee Purushotham and Co, Soap and Umbrella Merchants and in Bombay under the name and style of Shah Nagjee Purushotham & Co, the terms and conditions whereof are embodied in an Agreement of Partnership dated 30 5 1939 signed by all the Partners
"This agreement of partnership between (1) Nagjee
ceased to be partners either by retirement or death, and 103 Whereas the remaining partners (1) Nagjee
have carried on a partnership trade in Piecegoods, Banking and other articles in Cali cut with branches at Madras and Bombay, and Whereas (1) Purushotham 
and Tendolkar J that the assessee was entitled to the bene fit mentioned in section 25 (4) only in respect of the money lending business
It would therefore follow that by discontinuance in sub section (3) is meant complete cessation of the business
The business of (1) 129 umbrella and soap which never paid tax under the Act of 1918 could be dealt with by the partners as they liked without affecting the question of relief under section 25 in respect ,of the head business
1 to 3 herein are the Partners of the Firm of Sait Nagjee Purushotham & Co, Bankers, Piece goods and Yam merchants, Calicut "
In that case, a Hindu Un divided family was carrying on three separate businesses, namely money lending, running a ginning factory and a share business
These indicate that there were two firms, namely, one, of which the constitution appeared from annexure C I and which carried on umbrella and soap busi nesses and the other, consisting of Nagjee, Narayanjee and Manecklal carrying on other kinds of businesses the constitution of which appeared from annexure C 11
This court pointed out that though under the law of Partner ship a firm has no legal existence apart from its partners and it is merely a name to describe its partners compendiously, it is equally true that under that law also there is ordinarily no dissolution of the firm by the mere incoming or outgoing of partners
