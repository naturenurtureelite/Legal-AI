The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SABYASACHI MUKHARJI, J
These appeals under Section 35L(b) of the Central Excises & Salt Act, 1944 (hereinafter called 'the 979 Act ') are against the order Nos
450 452 of 1985A dated 4th July, 1985, 473/184A and 474/84A both dated 21st June, 1984 passed by the Customs, Excise & Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as 'the Tribunal ')
The appellant is a division of McDowell & Co Ltd It has its factory at, inter alia, Visakhapatnam
There it manufactures and sells fusel oil/Styrene Monomer falling under Tariff Item No 68 of the Ist Schedule to the Act
The case of the appellant is that the said fusel oil is a com pletely manufactured article and after completion of its manufacture, it is stored in storage tanks duly approved for this purpose
It is at this stage that the quantity of fusel oil/Styrene Monomer manufactured, according to the appel lant, is entered in the RG 1 Register maintained for goods manufactured by the appellant
It is also the case of the appellant that the said fusel oil/Styrene Monomer manufac tured by it is sold in bulk and delivered to the customers at the appellant 's factory
The fusel oil/Styrene Monomer is also capable of being supplied in road tankers to customers
The appellant had filed its price lists in respect of the same
In the said price lists, which were duly approved by the Asstt
Collector, the appellant had shown the value of fusel oil/Styrene Monomer at the rate at which those were sold in wholesale as "naked Ex Works and in bulk"
According to the appellant, the manufacture of fusel oil is complete and it is the fully manufactured fusel oil/Styrene Monomer which is stored in the storage tank
On 2nd July, 1983, a notice in respect of a consignment was issued to show cause as to why value of the drums should not be included in the value of the goods
There the drums had been supplied by the buyer
Another show cause notice as to why value of the drums should not be included in the assessable value of the goods, was issued to the appellant on the 5th April, 1983 pertaining to Gate Pass No 773 whereunder the appellant had cleared 24 KI of fusel oil in drums supplied by the buyer
Replies were duly filed to the said show cause notices by the appellant contending, inter alia, that as the drums were supplied by the buyer, value thereof could not be included in the assessable value
On the 11th August, 1983, two orders were passed by the Assist ant Collector one in relation to each of the aforesaid show cause notices
The Assistant Collector included the value of the drums in the assessable value of the said fusel oil/Styrene Monomer
Appeals were filed by the assessee
The same were allowed by the Collector (Appeals)
He held that the appellant had not collected any amount in excess of the amount indicated in the price lists
Therefore, in addition 980 to this amount, according to the Collector (Appeals), it was not open to the Asstt
Collector to inflate the assessable value without establishing the receipt of the additional consideration by the appellant apart from what had been shown in the invoice
There was a further appeal to the Tribunal
The Tribunal held that at the time of removal the goods were delivered from the factory in packed condition and the containers were not returnable by the buyer, there fore, the value had to be included in the assessable value
The Tribunal, therefore, accepted the revenue 's contention and restored the order of the Asst
Collector
Aggrieved therefrom, the appellant has come up in these appeals to this Court
On behalf of the appellant, Shri Salve contended that the Tribunal had failed to appreciate the admitted factual position that the fusel oil/Styrene Monomer manufactured by the appellant is sold in bulk and is capable of being so sold
Hence, according to the appellant, it is not necessary for the said fusel oil/Styrene Monomer to be supplied to the customers in drums in the aforesaid situation
The Tribunal, therefore, it was urged, ought to have held that the value could not be included in the assessable value of the fusel oil/Styrene Monomer
It was contended that in any event under the Act and the Rules, the duty of excise is payable by the manufacturer on the manufactured goods
The appellant was not a manufacturer of drums
The said drums were sup plied by the customers for the purpose of filling the fusel oil/Styrene Monomer
No duty of excise, therefore, could be collected from the appellant on such drums which were nei ther manufactured nor purchased by the appellant
It was further urged that on a correct and true interpretation of Section 4(4)(d)(i) of the Act, the cost of packing could be included in the assessable value only when the packing is either manufactured by the assessee or is purchased by the assessee
The said sub section does not contemplate, accord ing to the appellant, the inclusion of the cost of packing in the value of goods when the packing is supplied by a customer to a manufacturer on its own cost
It was contended by Shri Salve, appearing on behalf of the appellant, that on a correct analysis of section 4(4)(d), the duty being on the activity of manufacture whatever is necessary to bring the goods into existence alone can be taken into account for duty purposes
Reliance was placed by Shri Salve as well as by the learned Attorney General, appearing on behalf of the revenue, on the relevant provisions of the Act and the position as explained by this Court in Union of India & Ors
vs Bombay Tyre International Ltd, ; 981 Shri Salve has, however, contended that so far as this Court is concerned, this question is concluded by the deci sion of this Court in Collector of Central Excise vs Indian Oxygen Ltd, Learned Attorney General, however, contended that this decision did not deal with the present controversy
The said decision, according to learned Attorney General, was concerned with the rentals of certain oxygen gas cylinders supplied by the assessee
Reference was made to the decision of this Court in K Radha Krishaiah vs Inspector of Central Excise, Gooty & Ors, Shri Salve referred to and relied on the decision of tile High Court of Bombay in the case of Govind Pay Oxygen Ltd vs Asstt
Collector of Central Excise, Panaji & Ors, as also the decision of the Karnataka High Court in Alembic Glass Industries Ltd vs Union of India & Ors, Learned Attorney General urged before us that the question whether for determining the assessable value of the excisable goods sold by the assessee in drums or containers provided by its customers (the asses see itself provided such drums/containers on payment of price in Civil Appeals Nos
4339 41 of 1986) the value of such drums/containers would also have to be included on a correct interpretation of charging sections, namely, sec tions 3 and 4 of the Act
It was submitted that while deter mining the scope and nature of levy, as contemplated under section 3 of the Act, of central excise and the measure of such levy as provided in section 4 of the Act the principles laid down in Union of India vs Bombay Tyre International Ltd, (supra), should be followed and reliance was placed on the several decisions of this Court which we will refer to later
Learned Attorney General emphasised that it is a well settled principle of construction that in taxing statutes one has only to look merely at what is clearly stated
There is no room, he contended, for any intendment
There is no equity about a tax, it was submitted
There is no presump tion as to tax
Reliance was placed for this proposition by the learned Attorney General on the observations of this Court in Gur Sahai Sehgal vs Commissioner of Income Tax, Punjab, ; at 898
Learned Attorney General also drew attention to the decision of this Court in AK Roy vs Voltas Ltd, and also to Atic Industries Ltd vs HH Dave, Assistant Collector of Central Excise, ; at 568 to emphasise the point that percentages of sales do not in any manner affect determination of the assessable value of the excisable goods
In this connection, it may be rele vant to mention that in CA 4339 41/86, in respect of which show notice was issued as to why value of drums should not be included in the assessable value of fusel oil and Styrene Monomer, 90% of Styrene Mono 982 mer had been sold directly in tanks and only 10% of Styrene Monomer had been sold in drums and the show cause notice on 20th October, 1983 had been issued relating to clearance of fusel oil in 45 drums but the said drums had been supplied by the buyer
The Asstt
Collector in those appeals had included the costs of such drums in the value of styrene monomer
Relying on the two decisions referred to hereinbe fore, learned Attorney General emphasised that percentages of sales would not in any manner affect determination of the assessable value of the excisable goods
In AK Roy 's case (supra), it was held by this Court that though in that case that the fact that the assessee had effected sales to whole sale dealers only to the extent of 5 to 10% of its produc tion and that 90 95% of its production were only retail sales would not affect the question of determination of the assessable value of the excisable goods with reference to its value in the wholesale market
Therefore, the learned Attorney General submitted, the mere fact that the assessee in CA No 4339 of 1986 sold only 10% of the excisable goods to its buyer where drums were supplied by the buyers themselves and that 90% of the sales were through tankers belonging to the customers would not in any manner affect the question or determination of the assessable value of the excisable goods inasmuch as the 10% of its sales to whole sale buyers were in drums supplied by the buyers at the time of removal
According to the learned Attorney General, the fact that 90% of the goods were supplied in tankers and not in containers had no relevance at all and the 10% represent ed the entire quantity of excisable goods delivered in packed condition
Learned Attorney General contended that the decision of Indian Oxygen Ltd 's case (supra) cannot be relied on in view of the facts of this case
