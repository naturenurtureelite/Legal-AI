Appeal by certificate under Article 134(1)(c) of the Constitution of India from the judgment and order dated 18 3 1969 of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Criminal Revision Case No
This observation may provide no defence to a prosecution under section 133 but it might well do so in a prosecution under section 134
In this state of difference of opinion among the various High Courts and the absence of a decision of this Court on section 134 this appeal has been filed
What he says is, I may have committed an offence, but the offence that I have committed is not the one with which I am charged
We may now refer to some of the earlier decisions on this Point
414 and profit and loss account can be filed even though the default may be wilful
We may now set out the reasoning which weighed with the Andhra Pradesh High Court in the decision under appeal : "The reference to Section 210 by the use of the word aforesaid" and the emphasis indicated by the words "were so laid" make the filing of copies of those balance sheets and the profit and loss accounts which are laid before the general body meeting an essential prerequisite
Section 32 relates to the preparation of a list of members of the company and of persons who have ceased to be members as well as a summary, and also provides that it shall be completed within 21 days after the day of the first or only ordinary general meeting in the year
Solicitor General who appeared for the State of Andhra Pradesh and the learned Solicitor General who appeared for the Advocate General of Andhra Pradesh fairly placed before this Court all the decisions for and against, which we have already referred to, and also placed before us all the relevant considerations
In our Act various stages have to be gone through before we reach the stage of a copy of the balance sheet and the profit and loss account being filed with the Registrar and the failure to reach any one of the stages within the time prescribed is made penal by the 'Act
While the appeal to a question of principle might be attractive we cannot ignore the clear words of the section
But it appears to us that there is a very clear distinction between sections 32 and 133 on the one hand and section 134 on the other
It is clear, therefore, that on principle and authority it should be held that no offence was committed by the directors in this case under section 134
They might have been guilty of offences under sections 76 and 133 but not under section 134
It also provides that the company shall forthwith file with the registrar a copy of the list and summary, and any default hi complying with the requirements of the section is made punishable
Under section 133 the failure to comply with section 131 is made punishable
F section Nariman, Additional Solicitor General of India and A V Rangam, for the appellants
Therefore the condition precedent or the essential prerequisite of the balance sheet and the profit and loss account being laid before the general meeting of the company not being fulfilled, the requirement of section 134 cannot be complied with
The court there observed : "If it were the case that everything required to be inserted in the list was dependent on the fact of the general meeting having been held, it might perhaps have been contended with 416 some force that it is impossible to calculate a continuing penalty from a day which has never come into existence; but when one sees that section 25 requires a number of most important matters to be included in the list of members which are entirely independent of the holding of a general meeting, this very much weakens the contention that no list need be compiled if, owing to the failure to hold a general meeting, it is impossible to say what day is the fourteenth day thereafter"
417 of section 26 show that the, obligation to file the list is independent of the holding of the general meeting was accepted
This is an appeal against the judgment of the Full Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court reported in AIR
