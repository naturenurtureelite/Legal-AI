In this petition under Article 32 of the Constitution, they are seeking enforcement of their fundamental right to have "equal pay for equal work"
During the period of training, the trainees are paid a stipend by the Corporation
Apart from giving training, the Corporation also ensures marketing support to the artisans and craftsmen by purchasing their products at remunerative prices and sell them through the marketing network of the Corporation
In the first place, even assum ing that the petitioners ' jobs are comparable with the counterparts in the government service, the petitioners cannot enforce the right to "equal pay for equal work"
It has not been extended to employees of the Corporation
The Court, therefore, cannot direct the Corporation to apply the rates prescribed under exhibit P 2 unless the Government makes it applicable to employees of the Corporation
There the Court pointed out that that principle has to be read into Article 14 of the Constitution which enjoins the State not to deny any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the law and also to Article 16 which declares that there should be equality of opportu nity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the State

The Court found that the petitioner therein performed the same func 666 tions and duties as other drivers in the service of Delhi Administration
But the Court held that the principle of equal pay for equal work cannot be invoked invariably in every kind of service particularly in the area of professional services
So long as such value judgment is made bona fide, reasonably on an intelligible criterion which has a rational nexus with the object of dif ferentiation, such differentiation will not amount to discrimination
It is thus a service oriented organisation helping the village artisans and craftsmen to produce and market their products on remunerative prices
The Court held that the principle of "equal pay for equal work" has no mechanical application in every case of similar work
The petitioners are carpenters 1st and 2nd grade employed at the Wood Working Centre of the Himachal Pradesh State Handicrafts Corporation (the "Corpo ration")
They are given bonus under the Bonus Act and provident fund benefits under the Employees ' Provident Fund Act
It may not be necessary here to refer to all those decisions since almost all of them have been consid ered and explained in the recent two decisions to which one of us was a party (K Jagannatha Shetty, J)
