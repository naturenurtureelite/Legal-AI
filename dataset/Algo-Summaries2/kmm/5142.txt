The petitioner/ appellant thereafter filed a writ petition in the High Court of Patna which was dismissed without any speaking order
It further appears from the affidavit f f the District Magistrate filed before the High Court of Patna that the petitioner was absconding from the very day of the issuance of the detention order
There is no indication that this factor or the question that the said detenu might be released or that there was such a possibility of his release, was taken into consideration by the detaining authority properly and seriously before the service of the order
By letter dated 22nd February, 1986 the petitioner/appellant was informed that the Advisory Board had confirmed the order of detention
The petitioner/ appellant was in detention when the petitioner/appellant was served with the order of detention
All the documents which formed the basis of detention were supplied to the detenu
The order of detention though dated 2nd January, 1986 was served on or about 11th January, 1986
The grounds of challenge are all stated in the writ petition as well as special leave petition
It may be mentioned that in the petition it is nowhere stated that the detenu has since been released or that the prospect of his imminent release was properly and with seriousness considered by the detaining authority
331/85 dated 241285 u/s 149/307/32 IPC/27 Arms Act
It, however, appears that after the order of detention was passed and before the actual service of the order of detention, the petitioner was taken into custody
Nor does it appear that before the service there was consideration of this aspect properly
Therefore, though the order of preventive detention when it was passed was not invalid and on relevant considerations, the service of the order was not on proper consideration
910 It is the contention of the petitioner/appellant that the order of preventive detention could only be justified against a person in detention if the detaining authority was satisfied that his release from detention was imminent and the order of detention was necessary for putting him back in jail
The District Magistrate Dhanbad in respect of the petitioner under section 3(2) of the , hereinafter called the 'Act ' on the ground that the petitioner 's activities were prejudicial to the maintenance of public order
The service of order of detention on the petitioner while he was in jail was futile and useless since such an order had no application under section 3(2) of the Act
(crl) No

In the facts and circumstances of this case, therefore, the continued detention of the detenu under the Act is not justified
If, however, the detenu is released on bail in the aforesaid criminal cases, the matter of service of the detention order under the Act on the aforesaid materials may be reconsidered by the appropriate authority in accordance with the law
(crl) 27/86 dt
(Emphasis supplied) 5
In those circumstances it appears that the grounds for forming the satisfaction for the need for the detention were there, and there was rational nexus between the object of the order as contemplated by the Act and the materials on record
From the affidavit of the District Magistrate it does not appear that either the prospect of immediate release of the detenu or other factors which can justify the detention of a person in detention were properly considered in the light of the principles noted in the aforesaid decision and especially in the decisions, in Rameshwar Shaw vs District Magistrate, Burdwan & Anr
