Merely because the Medical Officer stated that the victim could have received the injury if she was standing, it did not follow that the injury could have been received in the circumstances mentioned by the accused
It is, therefore, essential that any view of the evidence in favour of the accused must be reasonable even as any doubt, the benefit of which an accused person may claim, must be reasonable
In cross examination she stated that she did not remember if she had told the Police that the accused made a gesture as if he was stabbing the deceased
The Inspector of Police P W 15, however, stated that P W 3 did not state before him that she saw the accused making a gesture as if he was stabbing the deceased
We do not think that we will be justified in rejecting the evidence of all the prosecution witnesses on the basis of this statement of P W 3
(2), Bhim Singh Rup Singh vs State of Maharashtra(3) it has been said that to the principles laid down in Sanwat Singh 's case may be added the further principle that "if two reasonable conclusions can be reached on the basis of the evidence on record, the Appellate Court should not disturb the finding of the Trial Court"
In this appeal the learned Counsel for the appellant argued that the accused had no motive to kill his wife and that his version was more probable than the version of the prosecution
The learned Counsel for the appellant advanced the usual argument submitted in all cases where an order of acquittal is reversed, namely, that where two views of the evidence are possible, the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt arising from the two views and that where the Trial Court has taken a possible view and acquitted the accused, the High Court should not interfere with the order of acquittal merely because another view is also possible
R Nagarathnam for the Appellant
365 The deceased Subhadramma was the wife of the appellant
He also contended that two views were possible on the evidence and the accused was entitled to the benefit of doubt
The appellant was acquitted by the learned Additional Sessions judge, Chittoor of an offence under Section 302, Indian Penal Code
4 and 5 who came to the scene soon afterwards, the High Court convicted the accused under Section 302 and sentenced him as aforesaid
The learned Sessions Judge thought that when there were two divergent versions given by the prosecution and the defence and when two views were possible, the benefit of doubt should be given to the accused
He urged that at the reasons given by the learned Sessions Judge had not been met by the High Court
We have perused the relevant evidence as well as the judgments of the Sessions Judge and the High Court
1, 2 and 3 were of a minor character and that they have been unduly magnified by the learned Sessions Judge
The Learned Sessions Judge held that the prosecution had failed to establish any motive and that the evidence of the prosecution witnesses was 'discrepant, conflicting and improbable '
The High Court observed that the learned Sessions Judge had magnified the importance to be attached to minor discrepancies
We are afraid the learned Sessions Judge allowed himself to be assailed by airy and fanciful doubts
Where the Trial Court allows itself to be beset with fanciful doubts, rejects creditworthy evidence for slender reasons and takes a view of the evidence which is but barely possible, it is the obvious duty of the High Court to interfere in the interest of justice, lest the administration of justice be brought to ridicule
1 to 3 and that the discrepancies noticed by the learned Sessions 367 Judge were of a minor character
vs State of Rajasthan(1)
"A reasonable doubt", it has been remarked, "does not mean some light, airy, insubstantial doubt that may flit through the minds of any of us about almost anything at some time or other, it does not mean a doubt begotten by sympathy out of reluctance to convict; it means a real doubt, a doubt founded upon reason"(4)
