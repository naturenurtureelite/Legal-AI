Aggrieved by the order of the Sub Divisional Officer, Raghubir Singh filed appeal before the Revenue Appellate Authority, Bikaner, who by his order dated 6th September, 1976 dismissed the same and upheld the order of the Sub Divisional Officer
Mr Subhagh Mal Jain learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant submitted that the State having not filed an appeal under section 225 of the Act of 1955 and or revision under Section 230 of the Act of 1955, the Board of the Revenue could not, while hearing the revision petition filed by Raghubir Singh, set aside the orders of Sub Divisional Officer and the revenue appellate authority under Section 221 of the Act of 1955
Dissatisfied with the order of the Revenue Appellate Authority, Raghubir Singh filed a revision application under Section 230 of the Act of 1955 before the Board of Revenue for Rajasthan
Jain for the Appellant
The first writ petition was filed by the father Raghubir Singh whereas the second writ petition was filed by his minor son Surendrapal Singh through his next friend Shri Jagjit Singh, maternal grand father of the minor
The matter was taken to the Board of Revenue for Rajasthan by a revision application and the Board by its order dated 14th April, 1975 directed that the ceiling area for Raghubir Singh may be determined according to the old law ie
The High Court by the impugned judgment dated 19th July, 1979 upheld the order of the Board of Revenue for Rajasthan and dismissed the writ petitions
It is clear from the judgment under appeal that the Board had by its order dated 14th April, 1975 directed that the ceiling, area may be determined according to old law ie
From the Judgment and Order dated 1971979 of the Rajasthan High Court in DB
The relief claimed in both the petitions before the High Court was the same, namely for setting aside of the order dated 6th August, 1977 passed by the Board of Revenue for Rajasthan, Ajmer
The contention on behalf of the appellant to that effect was negatived but on merits the High Court held that it was not appropriate for the Board to exercise the powers conferred by Section 9 of the land Revenue Act in view of the fact that the Board had appellate jurisdiction and it could not, therefore, make use of its powers of superintendence and control and the order of the Board could not be held proper with reference to Section 9 of the Land Revenue Act
He sought permission to adduce additional evidence in support of his contention
In that case also the High Court took the view that it is not correct to say that Section 9 is limited to the executive control and superintendence of the Board over subordinate revenue courts and it does not apply to judicial proceedings
The contention of learned counsel for the appellant is that the section confers executive powers of superintendence and control on the Board and it does not vest any power of superintendence on the Board on judicial side
The Division 727 Bench in that case was concerned with the interpretation of Section 9 of the Land Revenue Act
For this purpose he relied or the decision of the Division Bench of the Rajasthan High Court reported as Karan Singh vs Board of Revenue, Rajasthan
The facts of the case briefly are that proceedings under Chapter III B of the Rajasthan Tenancy Act (Act No
Section 221 of the Act of 1955 is not subject to the other provisions of the Act
3 of 1955) (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act of 1955) were commenced for determining the ceiling area for Raghubir Singh
