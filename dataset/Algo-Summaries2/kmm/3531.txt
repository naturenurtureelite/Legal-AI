That was obviously under a mistaken impression of the sickness benefit which the Act allowed for, as has been shown, it does not deal with all aspects of the demand for sickness benefit and does not, at any rate, provide for the grant of leave on full emoluments during the period of the workman 's physical incapacity to earn his normal wages because of his sickness
Even the Alembic Glass Industries Ltd has allowed 6 days sick leave in a year to its employ ees in Bangalore and it is permissible to accumulate it upto 12 days in addition to the current year 's leave, under a settlement dated July 17, 1969, which is being continued even after the coming into force of the Act
As has been stated, the Act came into force in the region concerned on December 14, 1969, and it has not been disputed before us that till then it was the practice in the glass industries to grant sick leave with wages for periods varying from 6 to 10 days
It was also pointed out that the benefit of sickleave of 7 days per year was initially given to the workmen under an award dated August 29, 1958 which contained a specific direction that it would be automatically discon tinued when the benefits of the Employees ' State Insurance scheme would become available to the workmen, and also that the reasonableness of the demand could not be examined by the Tribunal
The argument is however futile because, as has been stated, the Tribunal has cor rectly examined the controversy and given adequate reasons for allowing the benefit of 7 days sick leave in the manner set out in the award
The Company also contended that there was no practice of giving any such sick leave in the industries in Baroda or in the State of Gujarat
It has to be appreciated that a workman is prevented from earning the normal daily wages during the period of his illness and there is no justification for the argument that the rate of benefit at about half his wage, under the Act, should be considered sufficient so as to deny him the bene fit of sick leave on full emoluments for a period of 7 days when he is certified by a competent medical officer to be ill for that or a longer period
The benefit of sick leave was therefore lost when the Act was made applicable to the region from December 14, 1969
The appellants have filed a statement (exhibit 7) containing information regarding the companies which have provided the benefit of sick leave to its workmen in the region
It is therefore futile to contend that the benefit should not be admissible on the ground that it had not been allowed by other companies in the region
of the learned counsel for the parties, and will be disposed by a common judgment
Desai, A P Hathi, Mrs section Bhandare, M section Narasimhan KC
Learned counsel for the appellants have in fact not advanced any argument to the contrary
It would thus appear that the appellants have not been able to show that the awards in question are illegal or unjust; or would adversely affect the economy or the indus trial peace, or lead to imbalance in the conditions of service in other industrial establishments
As against this, the Tribunal has examined the financial capacity of the two companies in question, and has given adequate rea sons for holding that they are in good financial position and can bear the additional burden of sick leave
According to him, what has been awarded by the Tribunal is additional privilege leave for 7 days in the garb of sick leave
