M/s Tarapore & Company hereinafter called the plaintiffs applied in Suit No 118 of 1967 for an interim injunction restraining the Bank of India Ltd the first defendant in the suit from taking any steps in pursuance of a letter of credit opened in favour of M/s V/O Tractors Export, Moscow, the second defendant
Ramamurthi, J, by order dated April 12, 1968, granted an interim injunction restraining encashment of the letters of credit pending disposal of the suit
In appeals under the Letters Patent preferred by the second defendant,
the High Court of Madras set aside that order
Against the orders passed in the two appeals, the plaintiffs applied for certificate under Arts133(1)(a) and 133(1)(b) of the Constitution
The High Court observed that an order granting interim injunction "is a final order, as far as this Court is concerned, determining the rights of parties within this lit or proceeding, which is independent though ancillary to the suit", and they were competent to grant the certificate
By our order dated October 28, 1968, we ordered that the certificate granted by the High Court do stand revoked
We set out the reasons in support of that order
