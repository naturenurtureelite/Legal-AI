The demand made by the workmen was for bonus equivalent to six months ' wages, and the argument was that, if the Tribunal had worked out the surplus available on the correct basis, that surplus would have certainly justified grant of profit bonus at the rate of six months ' wages
It was also urged in the alternative that, even in adopting the latter course, the Tribunal committed an error inasmuch as, in making the calculation, the Tribunal only tried to neutralise about 36 per cent of the cost of living 9n the basis of the rise in Price Index instead 669 of permitting neutralisation to the extent of at least 90%, which could have been done when fixing the minimum wages for the owest, class of workmen
In the majority of the industries, which are being compared with the Company in the region, consequently, the minimum wage is the total wage packet receivable by the workman and there is no extra amount received as production bonus
Instead, what the Tribunal did was to work out the minimum wages, which should be paid, on an entirely different basis
The Tribunal found that there are only two other paper mills in the region
In fact, the Tribunal also accepted them as being comparable 'and that is why, in its conclusion, the Tribunal held that, in its opinion, it would be appropriate under the circumstances of the case to fix the minimum wage in the Company on the basis of the minimum wage prevailing in other industries in that region
On their basis, it appears to us that there will be full justification for fixing the minimum wage in the Company at Rs
The Tribunal should not have proceeded to make the alternative calculation on some other basis so as to arrive at a lower figure of Rs
in the Company must be fixed at the average level of 'wages in the other comparable industries in the region
in the same region
workmen of Orient Paper Mills Ltd, Brajrajnagar, have come up in this appeal by special leave against an award of the Industrial Tribunal, Orissa
Finally, it was argued that other amenities being provided by the Company should also be taken into account when fixing the minimum wage
In fact, in the course of arguments before us, we asked learned counsel for the Company to point out whether such a plea was taken at any stage by the Company and whether evidence was led to show that these concerns were not comparable with the Company
In connection with the fixation of minimum wage, one point vehemently argued by learned counsel for the workmen was that at least the dearness allowance element of the wage should have been made variable with the Price Index, so that the labour could automatically be compensated for further rise in the cost of living subsequent to the making of the award
of arguments at the last stage before us, learned counsel for the workmen confined his arguments to the bonus for the year 1962 63 only
parts of the country
On behalf of the workmen, it was urged before the Tribunal that the proportion should be 3: 1: 1, so that the production bonus and the dearness allowance would both be equal and 1/3rd of the basic wage
12 allowed by the Tribunal
On these facts, the Tribunal held that it would not be proper to compare the wage structure for these Paper Mills with that of the Company
In the present case, the Tribunal chose the course of leaving it to the workmen to ask for increase in minimum wage on any further rise in Price Index and did not consider it advisable to link the wages with it
The Tribunal was, therefore, quite correct in not trying to work out the surplus according to the Full Bench Formula and in awarding bonus on that basis
The Tribunal mentioned that, according to the Coal Award, the minimum wage in the Collieries at the then existing Price Index was Rs
The Tribunal, in its award, held that the minimum wage in so far as it consists of basic wage and dearness allowance,, should be fixed at Rs
Thus, the total minimum wage packet which a workman should be entitled to receive was fixed by the Tribunal at Rs
84 that we think the Tribunal should have substituted the figure of Rs
Consequently, in varying the award of the Tribunal we would direct that the 'total minimum wage packet of a workman in the Company shall be fixed ,at Rs
On this finding, it is clear that the region cure industry principle laid down in the ease of French Motor Car Co Ltd (1) could not have been applied by the Tribunal when fixing the wages in the Company
441 prevailing at the time of the award taking 100 as the basic index for the year 1939 In these circumstances, we think that the minimum wage in the Company should have been fixed by the Tribunalmensera, following the principle laid down by this Court in the case of French Motor Car Co(1)
670 This Court in the same case of the French Motor Car Co (x) further indicated what principles should be adopted in such a situation where there is no concern in the same industry in the region comparable with the concern in which wages have to be fixed
Ltd vs The Workmen,(x) where also the Court did not hold that it was compulsory to link minimum wage with the cost of living index and only envisaged that such linking may be permissible by holding that : "It is thus clear that the concept of minimum wage, does take in the factor of the prevailing cost of essen (1) ; 675 tial commodities whenever such minimum wage is to be fixed
An industrial dispute between these workmen and the management of Orient Paper Mills Ltd (hereinafter referred to as "the Company") was referred by the State Government under section 10(1) (d) of the Industrial Disputes Act (hereinafter referred to as "the Act") for adjudication by the Tribunal enumerating 30 different items of dispute
Further, even in the same line of business, it would not be proper to compare (for example) a small struggling concern with a large flourishing concern "
(x) The Company is paying profit bonus equivalent to three months ' basic wage of each workman

In other industries, which are comparatively close to the paper industry at (1) [1963] Supp
are beingcompared with the Company for the purpose of fixation of the minimum wage Consequently, we do not think that there is any justification for departing from the figure of Rs95 which is the average minimum wage payable by those industries (1) [1963] Supp
