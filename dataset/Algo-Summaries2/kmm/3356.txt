It failed to notice certain broad facts which should definitely weigh with the court while appreciating ocular testimony
But the fact that the witness has stated in the first information report that the deceased was only mentioning the name of accused Karunakaran as his assailant, this earlier version appears to be contradicted by the medical evidence
Another very serious departure from his earlier version is that while PW 4 had stated in the first information report that "my elder brother" (meaning the deceased) was "chasing him from behind" in court he has completely given a go by to this statement and stated that Karunakaran was being chased by PWs 1, 2, and 3

A N Mulla, K Jayaram and P Chandrasekhar for the Appellant
In the first information report which PW 4 lodged at the Thana, which is very close to the place of occurrence, within about 15 minutes of the occurrence, inter alia, stated thus: 4 L159SCI/76 710 At about 1115

There were also no blood stains on the bench where he was said to be sleeping
The High Court further held that PW 4 gave a "candid, natural and truthful version
He ran to his elder brother who came from the side of the bench where he was sleeping and who fell down on the southern side of the sluice
The High Court held that "PW 4 who was afflicted with the fell disease of leprosy
It is difficult to accept this explanation of this witness
