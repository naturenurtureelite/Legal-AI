1 and the Court shall put the appellant in possession of the suit land
Thereafter, a host of writ petitions 122 were filed in this Court under Article 32 of the Constitu tion challenging the constitutional validity of section 15 on the ground that it infringed Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution
Since this Court found certain intrinsic contradictions in the list of relatives covered by the first three clauses, it saw no justification for the classification contained in the said provision conferring a right based on consanguinity and, therefore, struck down those clauses:as discriminatory and violative of Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution
Once conferment of the right of pre emption in favour of co sharers was considered to be a reasonable restriction on the right to hold, acquire and dispose of property under Article 19(1) (f), the same re striction was held to be valid when tested on the touchstone of Articles 14 or 15 of the Constitution
RKKapoor and Anis Ahmed Khan for the Appellant
his share therein derived from his vendors, in favour of the appellant and shall deliver possession thereof to the appellant
In the present case also the appellant seeks to exercise the right of pre emption as a co sharer ie
128 We direct that on the appellant plaintiff depositing the entire amount of sale price together with the amount needed for the stamp duty for the execution of the conveyance in his favour within three months from today, the purchaser respondent No
At the same time it upheld the right conferred on co sharers for reasons stated earlier
Therefore, the petition ers cannot claim the right of pre emption under clause 'Fourthly ' We do not, therefore, find any substance in this contention "
Counsel for the appellant, however, contended that the interpretation placed by the two judge Bench on the expression 'other co sharers ' in section 15(1)(b) requires reconsideration as it leads to certain anomalous situation eg
Since the petitioners admittedly fall either under clause 'First ' or under clause 'Secondly ' of Section 15(1)(b) of the Act they are clearly outside the scope of clause 'Fourthly '
Accord ing to section 15 of this Act before its amendment in1960, in the case of sale of a share out of joint land or proper ty, the right of preemption was conferred firstly on the lineal descendents of the vendor in order of succession; secondly, in the co sharers, if any, who are agnates, in order of succession; thirdly in persons not included under firstly or secondly above, in order of succession, who but for such sale would be entitled, on death of the vendor, to inherit the land or property sold and fourthly, in the co sharers
We find it diffi cult to hold that the purport of the of Court 's decision in Attam Prakash 's case was to deny the right of pre emption to those relative or relatives of the vendor or vendors who were specified in the erstwhile first three clauses of section 15(1)(b) even if they happen to be co sharers
Since in the present case, we are concerned with sale by a single co sharer and not 125 by all the co sharers jointly, the remaining part of section 15(1)(b), with which we are concerned, reads as under: "15(b)
Counsel for the appellant submitted that since the suit land belonged to more than one co sharer and had not been sold jointly by all the co sharers, he, as a co sharer, was entitled to claim the right of pre emption under clause 'fourthly ' of section 15(1)(b)
With respect, therefore, we find it difficult to approve of the interpretation placed on clause `fourthly '; of section 15(1)Co) of the Act by this Court in Jagdish 's case
It is seen that the expression 'other co sharers ' in clause 'Fourthly ' of Section 15(1)(b) of the Act refers to only those co sharers who do not fail under clause 'First ' or 'Secondly ' or 'Thirdly ' of Section 15(1)(b) of the Act
The history of the Punjab Pre emption law may be kept in mind to understand the purport of clause 'Fourthly ' of section 15(1)(b) of the Act
This Court never intended to exclude any speci fied co owners from the scope of clause fourthly of section 15(1)(b) of the Act
Finding no reasonable classifi cation it struck down 124 clauses 'first ', 'secondly ' and 'thirdly ' of section 15(1)(a), clauses 'first ', 'secondly ', and 'thirdly ' of section 15(1)(b) and clause 'first ', 'secondly ', and 'third ly ' of section 15(1)(c) and the entire section 15(2) as ultra vires the Constitution
The right of pre emption to co sharers is held to be intra vires the Consti tution Therefore, it is difficult to hold that this Court intended to deny the right of pre emption of those kinsfolk even if they happened to be co sharers
