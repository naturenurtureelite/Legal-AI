The High Court of Karnataka tided over the difficulty by interpreting the expression "tourist cars" as meaning "tourist vehicles"
It was said that the clause contained sufficient guidelines for the exercise of discretion in granting approval by the Central Government
In the second place, we have no indication as to the manner in which the approval of the Central Government is to be sought and granted and the considerations which are expected to weigh with the Central Government
Desai, J, speaking for the court observed: "However, when an application for a permit is made under Chapter IV, the Undertaking has to compete with private operators who may as well make an application for permit
A large number of applicants filed writ petitions in the High Court
"Tourist vehicle" is defined by section 2(29 A) as "a contract carriage constructed or adapted and equipped and maintained in accordance with such specifications as the State Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, specify in this behalf"
The State Transport Authority, by its proceedings dated April 30, 1984, granted 11 out of the 14 permits to the Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation, one permit to the Indian Tourism Development Corporation and two permits to the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation
A number of appeals were preferred to the Karnataka State Transport Appellate Tribunal
The matter appears to be left to the total discretion of the Central Government, virtually as we said, pre empting the decision of the statutory tribunal
By the time the proviso came into force, 36 permits had been granted by the Karnataka State Transport Authority and 14 remained to be granted
Section 57 deals, generally with the procedure to be followed in applying for and granting permits
Section 52 and 53 deal with private carrier 's permit and sections 54, 55 and 56 deal with public carrier 's permit
Vaidyanathan, learned counsel for the 'Preferred ' Operators has placed before us 'a Scheme for granting approval to tourist transport operators in India '
section 2(33) defines a "transport vehicle" as meaning a "public service vehicle or a goods vehicle"
Section 42 prescribes permits for the use of a transport vehicle in any public place
let it be made clear that while considering the application for stage carriage permit under section 47, the private operator has an equal chance to get a permit even on inter State route if it shows that the Undertaking is either unable to provide efficient and economical service or that the private operator is better equipped to render the same
To the extent that it goes, the clause pre empts the decision of the designated tribunal by executive discretion
The Tribunal rejected their appeals regretfully
In the judgment under appeal, the High Court attempted to distinguish the decision of this Court in Sher Singh 's case on the ground that any other interpretation would have wiped out the difference between Chapter IV and Chapter IV A
In an application under Chapter IV, Corporation has to enter the arena like any other applicant, face the competition and come up to the level of other private operators intending to obtain stage carriage permits and then in respect of the route in question claim preference
The proviso to section 47(1) prescribes that, other things being equal, a registered cooperative society and a person possessing a licence for driving transport vehicles shall be given preference over individual owners in granting stage carriage permits
We have no hesitation in saying that all that has been said about 'preference ' in Sher Singh 's case in relation to section 47(1 H) applies mutatis mutandis to the preference contemplated by the proviso to section 63(7)
A question was raised before us about the vires of the fourth clause of the proviso to section 63(7)
63(7) of the 
Section 47(1) prescribes the matters to be taken into consideration in granting stage carriage permits and the first consideration, naturally, is "the interest of the public generally "
It is as follows: "(7) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub section(1) but subject to any rules that may be made under this Act, any State Transport Authority may, for the purpose of promoting tourism, grant permits valid for the whole or any part of India, in respect of such number of tourist vehicles as the Central Government may, in respect of that State, specify in this behalf, and the provisions of Sections 49, 50, 51, 57, 58, 59, 59 A, 60, 61 and 64 shall, as far as may be, apply in relation to such permits: Provided that preference shall be given to applications for permits from (i) the India Tourism Development Corporation; (ii) a State Tourism Development Corporation; (iii) a State Tourist Department; (iv) such operators of tourist cars, or such travel agents, as may be approved in this behalf by the Ministry of the Central Government dealing in tourism "
Chapter IV A relates to "special provisions relating to State Transport Under takings "
Preference in this context would mean that other things generally appearing to be qualitatively and quantitatively equal though not with mathematical accuracy, statutory provision will tilt the balance in favour of the Undertaking "
Surely it cannot be said that experience of running a tourist taxi is a better qualification than running a tourist bus when the question of granting permits for tourist vehicles arises
