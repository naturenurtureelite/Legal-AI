In the present appeal the appellant ceases to be a public servant as h resigned from the office
We may briefly refer to those contentions not for the pur pose of examining them, since most of them have not been pressed before us, but only to indicate as to how the appel lant projected his case
The President has not been given the sole power or the exclusive power to remove a Judge either of the Supreme Court or of the High Court from his office though the Presi dent appoints the Judge by warrant under his hand and seal after consultation with such of the Judges of the Supreme Court and of the High Court in the States as he may deem necessary for that purpose and in case of the appointment of the Judge of the High Court, the President appoints a Judge by warrant under his hand and seal after consultation with the Chief Justice of India, the Governor of the State and in a case of appointment of a Judge other than the Chief Jus tice, the Chief Justice of the High Court
It is inappropriate to state that conviction and sen tence are no bar for the Judge to sit in the Court
We may make it clear that if a Judge is convicted for the offence of criminal misconduct or any other offence involving moral turpitude, it is but proper for him to keep himself away from the Court
If the Chief Justice of India himself is the person against whom the allegations of criminal misconduct are received the Government shall consult any other Judge or Judges of the Supreme Court
"A legislator or an administrator may be found guilty of corruption without apparently endangering the foundation of the State
But to state that after collection of all material the investi gating Officer must give an opportunity to the accused and call upon idm to account for the excess of the assets over the known sources of income and then decide whether the accounting is satisfactory or not, would be elevating the Investigating Officer to the position of an enquiry officer or a judge
The Constitution, while providing that their position would be akin to that of a Judge of the Supreme Court, could not have intended to place them on a pedestal higher than that of a Supreme Court Judge
In the instant case the then Chief Justice of India was requested to give his opinion whether the appellant could be proceeded under the Act
His first contention is that the Judges of the High Courts and the Supreme Court are not within the purview of the Act, which is a special enactment applicable to public servants, in whose case prosecution can be launched after sanction granted under Section 6 of the Act, which is alien to the scheme envisaged for constitu tional functionaries like Judges of the High Courts and Supreme Court
It is sufficient that the authorities prescribed there under fall within the fair sense of the language of the Section
A trial without a valid sanction where one is necessary under section 6 has been held to be a trial without jurisdiction by the court
In other words, the argument is that not withstanding the fact that no sanction was required for prosecution of the appellant after his retirement, the need and feasibility of grant of the sanction under Section 6 of the Act if he was prosecuted before his retirement is the test to determine the applicability of the Act to a person holding, the office of a Judge or Chief Justice of a High Court
But Parliament, coun sel contended, cannot be the sanctioning authority for the prosecution of a Judge
The last and 231 perhaps the most important contention urged before the High Court was regarding the necessity to obtain prior sanction from the competent authority for prosecution of the appellant as required under Section 6 of the Act
It is argued that if the grant of sanction under Section 6 of the Act for prosecution of the incumbent for the offence is not feasible or envisaged, the clear indica tion is that holder of such office does not fall within the purview of the Act
The grant of previous sanction under Section 6 being a condition precedent for the prosecution of a public servant covered by the Act, it must follow that the holder of an office who may be a public servant according to the wide definition of the expression in the Act but whose category for the grant of sanction for prosecution is not envisaged by Section 6 of the Act, is outside the purview of the Act, not intended to be covered by the Act
It was, however, contended that for the purpose of deciding the question of applicability of the Act to the appellant as a Judge or Chief Justice of the High Court, the office with reference to which the offence under the Act is alleged to have been committed, it is necessary to consider the feasibility of grant of sanction under Section 6 of the Act for prosecution of a person holding such an office
Conversely, if the holder of a public office while continuing in that office could not be prosecuted under this Act on account of inapplicability of Section 6 and, therefore, the non feasibility of previous sanction for prosecution under Section 6, then on his ceas ing to hold the office, he is not brought within the purview of the Act merely because Antulay decides that no sanction for prosecution under Section 6 is 'needed after the holder of a public office ceases to hold that office
He held that post till 20 February 1960 when he was elevated to the Bench as a perma nent Judge of the Madras High Court
On 2021960, he was elevated to the Bench of the Madras High Court being appointed as a permanent Judge of that Court
The standards of judicial behaviour, both on and off the Bench, are normally extremely high
But a Judge must keep himself absolutely above suspicion" to preserve the impartiality and independence of the judiciary
It is, therefore, necessary to evolve some method commensurate with the grant of sanction in cases of serious allegation corruption and acquisition or the posses sion of disproportionate assets which the Judge cannot satisfactorily account for 'or possession of property dispro portionate to the sources of income of the Judge
Thereafter it shall be presented to the President for removal of the Judge
The process and power are 'both integrated in Parliament and Parliament alone is competent to remove a Judge
Mr Tulsi, learned Additional Solicitor General, on the other hand, emphasised on the role of the President in relation to removal of a Judge
Parliament cannot therefore be the proper authority for granting sanction for the prosecution of a Judge
In this view, the President can be considered as the authority to grant sanc tion for prosecution of a Judge since the order of the President for the removal of a Judge is mandatory, The motion passed by each House of Parliament with the special procedure prescribed under clause (4) of Article 124 will not proprio vigore operate against the judge
The expression "public servant" used in the Preven tion of Corruption Act, 1947 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Act ') is undoubtedly wide enough to denote every judge, including Judges of the High Court and the Supreme Court
It was further alleged that he has committed offences under Section 5(2) read with clauses (b)(d) and (e) of Section 5(1) of the Act
Clauses (a), (b) and (c) in Sub section (1) of Section 6 exhaus 286 tively provide for the competent authority to grant sanction for prosecution in case of all the public servants failing within the purview of the Act
It follows that the holder of an office, even though a 'public servant ' accord ing to the definition in the Act, who does not fall within any of the clauses (a), (b) or (c) of Sub section (1) of Section 6 must be held to be outside the purview of the Act since this special enactment was not enacted to cover that category of public servants inspite of the wide definition of 'public servant ' in the Act
Admittedly, such previous sanction is a condition precedent for taking cognizance of an offence punishable under the Act, of a public servant who is prosecuted during his continuance in the office
The argument is that in view of the language of the Act considered along with the provisions of the Constitution especially Article 124, Section 5 of the Act must be held to be inapplicable to the High Court and Supreme Court Judges
It follows that the public servant falling within the purview of the Act must invariably fall within one of the three clauses in Sub section (1) of Section 6
Article 2 18 states that provisions of clauses (4) and (5) of Article 124 shall apply in relation to a High Court
The second proposition relates to the inapplicability of the Act to Judges of the High Courts and Supreme Court
Article 2 18 provides that the provisions of clauses (4) and (5) of Article 124 shall apply in relation to a High Court as they apply in relation to the Supreme Court
The appeal raises the questions of singular importance and consequence to Judges of the High Courts and this Apex Court
In my view the approval of Chief Justice of India can be introduced 268 as a condition for prosecution only by the Parliament and not by this Court
Bansi vs State of Maharashtra), ; Existence thus of a valid sanction is a pre requisite to the taking of cognizance of the enumerated offences alleged to have been committed by a public servant
He must then proceed to record his own finding on the expla nation of the public servant
The question, therefore, arises who is the author ity competent to grant sanction
Antulay; , before a Constitution Bench of this Court where it has been observed: "Section 6 bars the Court from taking cogni zance of the offences therein enumerated alleged to have been committed by a public servant except with the previous sanction of the competent authority empowered to grant the requisite sanction 
Iqbal Ahmed vs State of AP, it was held that the terminus 228 a quo for a valid sanction is the time when the court is called upon to take cognizance of the offence
The learned Solici tor General and the Additional Solicitor General also urged that adequate safeguards in the form of guidelines be sug gested by this Court to prevent any abuse of executive authority or harassment to independent Judges
In other words, the authority itself should be competent to remove or the one to decide the question of removal and not the which merely obeys or implements by the decision of some other authority
Judges should be of stern stuff and tough fibre, unbending before power, economic or political, and they must uphold the core principle of the rule of law which says "Be you ever so high, the law is above you "
On 229 1 May 1969, he became the Chief Justice of the Madras High Court
The inescapable con 304 clusion, therefore, is that the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, as amended by the 1964 amendment is inapplicable to Judges of the High Courts and the Supreme Court
I may also at this stage refer to the recommendations made by the Santhanam Committee which preceded the 1964 amendment in the Act
The 1964 amendment made in the Act pursuant to the recommendations of the Santhanam Commit tee did not make any amendment in the Act to indicate that Judges of the High Courts and the Supreme Court were also brought within the purview of the Act
In 1953 he was appointed as Assistant Government Pleader and in 1959, the Government Pleader at Madras
Criminal Appeal No
This is the main question arising for decision in this appeal
The Act had already been made when the Constitution was framed and the amendment made in the Act in 1964 was after the experience for some time of the functioning of the judiciary under the Constitu tion
Under the British Prevention of Corruption Act, 1906 the power to give consent for prose cution for an offence under that Act has been conferred upon the Attorney General or Solicitor General
In 1917, Justice Archibald of the Commerce Court was 'removed from office by impeachment for soliciting for himself and others, favours from railroad companies, some of which were at the time litigants in his court; in 1936 the removal of Judge Wright of the Florida Court for conduct in relation to a receivership Which evoked serious doubts as to this integ rity, although he was acquitted of specific charges, seem to have restored the wider view
However, in view of the importance of the Constitu tional questions involved in the case the High Court granted certificate for appeal to this Court
Article 217 provides that every Judge of a High Court shall be appointed by the President by warrant under his hand and seal after consultation with the Chief Justice of India, the Governor of the State, and in the case of appointment of a Judge other than the Chief justice, the Chief Justice of the High Court
No such immunity from criminal prosecution has been provided for in the case of a Judge of the High Court or of the Supreme Court
Similarly in the case of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court the Presi dent shall consult such of the Judges of the Supreme Court as he may deem fit and proper and the President shall act in accordance with the advice given to him by the Judge or Judges of the Supreme Court
But that is not the position in the case of removal of a Judge
In the case of Judges of the High Courts and the Supreme Court, there is no such requirement under any provi sion of furnishing particulars of their assets so as to provide a record thereof with reference to which such an opinion can be formed and there is no vertical superior with legal authority enabling obtaining of information from the concerned Judge
It is a well established principle that no person is above the law and even a constitutional amendment as contained in Article 329 A in the case of the Prime Minister was struck 266 down in at 470 C D It has to be remembered that in a proceeding under Article 124 a Judge can merely be removed from his office
It is a settled law that the authority entitled to grant sanction must apply its mind to the facts of the case and all the evidence collected before forming an opinion whether to grant sanction or not
By a catena of decisions, it has been held that the authority entitled to grant sanction must apply its mind to the facts of the case, evidence collected and other incidental facts before according sanction
The investigation of the case by CBI was however, con tinued with the culmination of filing a final report
