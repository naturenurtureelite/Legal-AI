The High Court overruled the prayer made on behalf of the government to stay the operation of its decision till necessary orders were obtained from this Court
Therefore, these appeals were filed after obtaining special leave from this Court
the State government or the High Court
In that case, the State government ordered the transfer of certain district judges without even consulting the High Court
For however well meaning a Minister may be he can never possess the same intimate knowledge of the working of the judiciary as a whole and of individual Judges, as the High Court
It must be presumed that they were taken over by the government with the consent of the High Court
policy decision was duly communicated to the government
We do not think that it was proper for the government to do so
Those officers acted in accordance with the orders of the government
The government as well as the concerned officers in the returns made by them justified the action taken by the government
It was conceded that if those posts had not been included in the cadre of superior judicial service the High Court would not have had any right to fill those posts
There is less chance of success for a person seeking advantage for himself if the Chief Justice and his colleagues, with personal information, deal with the matter, than when a Minister deals with it on notes and information supplied by a secretary
But our Constitution expects all of them to work in harmony in a spirit of service
As mentioned earlier, member, sales tax tribunal, was an ex cadre post
In these circumstances we fail to see how the High Court could have held that they had no authority to hold the posts in question
AS seen earlier, he was holding the post in question ever since 1962In those circumstances, the High Court was entitled to recall him and post him as a district and sessions judge
district and sessions judge
After analysing articles 233 and 235 and noticing the development of the law on the subject this Court held that under article 233, the Governor is only concerned with the appointment, promotion and posting to the cadre of district judges but not with the transfer of district judges already appointed or promoted and posted to the cadre which power is vested in the High Court under article 235 as the control given to the High Court over the district courts under that Article includes control over the officers who preside over those courts

district judges, from one post to another whether as a judge or to one of the posts in the secretariat was in his hands
(1) ; (2) ; 161 namely, whether the power to transfer District Judges is included in the 'control ' exercisable by the High Court over District Courts under article 235, or in the power of 'appointment of persons to be and the posting and promotion, of district judges ' which is to be exercised by the Governor under article 233, albeit in consultation with the High Court
On September 21 1966, this Court rendered its decision in Ranga Mahammad 's(1) case
Now let us consider the ratio of the decisions in Nripendra Nath Bagchi 's case (1), and Ranga Mahammad 's (2) case
In Ranga Mahammad 's case(2), the point that arose for decision was as to who was the authority to transfer a district judge
In Orissa, as in most of the other States, that practice continued till the decision of tiffs Court in the State of Assam vs Ranga Mahammad and others(1)

The order of the High Court consists of two parts, namely, (1) holding that Shri BK
Proceeding further this Court observed: "This is, of course, as it should be, the High Court is in the day to day control of courts and knows the capacity for work of individuals and the requirements of a particular station or Court
Hence the reference by this Court to the cadre is a reference toa cadre consisting essentially ,of officers under the direct control of the High Court
