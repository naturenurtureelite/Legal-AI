Civil Appeal No 3909 of 1986
From the Judgment and order dated 2991986 of the Allahabad High Court in CR No 83 of 1986
Shanker Ghosh and P K Jain for the Appellants
YS Chitale
Madan Lokur, Prashant Bhushan, Beni Parshad, Rajinder Dhawan and Jitendra Sharma for the Respondents
This appeal arises out of a judgment passed by the High Court of Allahabad in Civil Revision No 83 of 1986 wherein the learned Judge of the High Court allowed the revision petition set aside the judgment and decree of the Trial Judge and decreed the plaintiff suit for ejectment of the appellant
The disputed property was let out on June 25, 1976
The accommodation was for the first time assessed for house tax by the Nagar Palika Ghaziabad with effect from October 1, 1976
The suit was filed for eviction after termination of tenancy before the trial court and objection was raised that as the shop and the basement were separately let out the tenancy could not be terminated by a single notice that would be invalid
The trial court therefore dismissed the suit
The High Court set aside this conclusion of the trial court
The main ground which was before the High Court was as to whether the provisions of UP Urban Buildings (Regulation of Letting, Rent and Eviction) Act, 1972 ( 'Act ' for short) will be applicable to these proceedings in view of the fact that although the premises were let out in June 1976 but as the assessment was made on October 1, 1976 the provisions of the Act referred to above will not apply for 10 years from October 1, 1976 and therefore the suit could be decreed as the protection available under this Act will not be available to the tenant
