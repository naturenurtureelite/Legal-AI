The Board points out that over a long period beginning from September 1961 the Department had been receiving various complaints in regard to the conduct of the affairs of the Company
According to the second appellant, the four directors were disgruntled directors, hostile to him and the Company
A meet ing was held on May 10, 1965 between him and the directors of the 345 appellant company
Here Mr Dutt has stated that it was not competent to the Court to go into the question of adequacy or otherwise of the material on the basis of which orders under section 237(b) are passed by the Board
But it was not solely on the basis of this memorandum that action was taken by the Board
By notification dated February 1, 1964 the Central Government has delegated, amongst other powers and functions, those conferred upon it by section 237 upon the Company Law Board
By order dated February 6, 1964 the Chairman of the Company Law Board specified the cases and classes of cases to be considered jointly by the Board and distributed the remaining business between himself and other members of the Board
On May 30, 1964 and July 9, 1964 four of its directors submitted two memoranda alleging irregularities and even illegalities in the conduct of the company 's affairs to the Company Law Board
In paragraphs 5, 8 and 16 of his affidavit, the Chairman stated that he had various materials on the basis of which he passed the order
Coming now to the affidavit of Mr Dang I find that he merely repeats what was stated in the affidavit of the Chairman
In such a case it would not be appropriate for this Court while hearing an appeal by special leave to interfere lightly with the exercise of that discretion
Amongst the matters allocated to the Chairman is the appointment of an Inspector under section 237 to investigate the affairs of a company
It was this difculty of the shareholders which is a reality which had led to the enactment of the section
illegality or action or actions with intent to defraud, as contemplated by the section
In fact, paragraph 16 is no more than a mechanical repetition of the words of the section
In the present case no action under any of the sections noted so far was taken but it was taken under section 237
In the exercise of the power conferred by this rule, the Chairman assigned the business under section 237 to himself
It is in that paragraph alone that the appellants had specifically raised the contention that the recital in the order as to the existence of material is not correct and that in point of fact there was no material before the Board to form the said opinion
As we have said, the section gives the exploratory power only
If the action is questioned on the ground that no circumstance leading to an inference of the kind contemplated by the section exists, the action might be exposed to interference unless the existence of the circumstances is made out
L A Mitchell Ltd No material, however, is placed before us from which it could be reasonably inferred that had the negotiations with Kali Chemie fructified M/s
(b) thereof confers, a discretion upon the Board to appoint an Inspector to investigate the affairs of a company
if, in the opinion of the Central Government, there are circumstances suggesting (i) that the business of the company is being conducted with intent to defraud its creditors, members or any other persons, or otherwise for a fraudulent or unlawful purpose, or in a manner oppressive of any of its members, or that the company was formed for any fraudulent or unlawful purpose; (ii) that persons concerned in the formation of the company or the management of its affairs have in connection therewith been guilty of fraud, misfeasance or other misconduct towards the company or towards any of its members; or (iii) that the members of the company have not been given all the information with respect to its affairs which they might reasonably expect, including information relating to the calculation of the commission payable to a managing or other director, the managing agent, the secretaries and treasurers, or the manager, of the company
The Chairman obtained the opinion of quite a few of his assistants (perhaps more than was altogether necessary) and this fact is stated to establish his fairness to and honest dealing with the Company
He also wanted us to bear in mind the sequence in which certain events occurred and said that these would indicate that the former Finance Minister must have been instrumental in having an order under section 237(b) made by the Chairman of the Board
Clause (a) of sub section (1) of section 637 read with section 10(E)(1) empower the Central Government to delegate its powers under section 237 to the Company Law Board
In this connection he has referred us to sub section 4A of section 10E which was subsequently added but not made retrospective by an amendment of the Act which confers an express power on the Central Government to enable the Chairman to distribute the powers and functions of the Board
According to the learned Attorney General this provision was enacted only to make what was implicit in section 10E(5) read with section 642(1) clear and that the distribution of the work of the Board being merely a matter of procedure the order of the Chairman allocating the power under section 237(b) to himself did not amount to sub delegation of the power of the Board
He acts in the name of the Board and is no more than its agent But even if he is looked upon as a delegate of the Board and, therefore, a sub delegate vis a vis the Central Government he would be as much subject to the control of the Central Government as the Board itself
(3) One of the members shall be appointed by the Central Government to be the chairman of the Company Law Board
(4) No act done by the Company Law Board shall be called in question on the ground only of any defect in the constitution of, or the existence of any vacancy in, the Company Law Board
Similarly could not the fact that the company was continuously showing losses since its flotation and that 1/ 3rd of its 326 share : capital had ,been wiped out could have been suggestive of fraud to the Board
I am all the more persuaded to come to this conclusion having regard to the fact that in paragraph 14 of his affidavit the Chairman has disclosed the circumstances which he took into account in passing the order
in the hands of the Court provided they were not shown to the other side, but no such offer was made in this Court
The maxim does not embody a rule of law
The firm of T T Krishnamachari & Sons approached appellant No
The appellants also say that T T Krishnamachari & Sonswere later a so granted a licence to set up a plant for manufacturing barium chemicals but that on appellant No
T T Krishnamachari & Sons was revoked and as they were not even given sole selling agency for the sale of the products of barium chemicals Mr T T Krishnaniachari wanted action to be taken under this provision either for penalising appellant No
While he was so negotiating, M/s, ,T T Krishnamachari & Co, who were the sole selling agents of the said German Company, approached the 2nd appellant for the sole selling agency of barium products of the plant proposed to be put up by the 2nd appellant
In these circumstances, I cannot go by the allegations made against the Chairman of the Board personally or those made against the Minister, and I find no evidence to hold that dishonesty on the part of the one or malice on the part of the other lies at the root of this action
It would then have been a question whether this Court could or should go behind the affidavit
The matter was enquired into by the Regional Director of the Board at Madras and he, in his report, sent to the Board in September 1964 suggested an urgent and comprehensive investigation into the affairs of the Company
In September, 1964, a meeting was affanged in London between the company 's representatives and the representatives of LA Mitchell Ltd, of which Lord Poole was the Chairman
I before us, since its incorporation in the year 1961 and to report to the Company Law Board inter alia "all the irregularities and contravention in respect of the provisions of the or of any other law for the time being in force and the person or persons responsible for such irregularities and contravention "
On August 25, 1959 and September 23, 1960 appellant No
1626 C of 1965
As a result of the notice Lord Poole visited India in April/May, 1965
Apart from this we do not think that the conclusions set out in paragraph 14 are extraneous to the matters indicated in the order of May 19, 1965
Lord Poole agreed that the British company would put in pound 250,000 in addition to the amount already invested by it and that production would commence from June, 1965
It is also suggested by Mr Setalvad that the action approved of in December, 1964 was delayed till May, 1965 because in the interval some negotiations with Kali Chemie had been started and had they ended fruitfully M/s
On December 5, 1960 M/s
324 order to do justice, then the Board would have no objection to producing the same for the Court 's perusal provided it is not shown to the petitioners "
On this part of the case the appellant 's contention is that the Chairman of the Company Law Board Mr R C Dutt made the order for investigation into the affairs of appellant No
There is nothing to show that the High Court thought that a prima facie case of mala fides had been made out
The Committee rejected the application of M/s
In paragraph 10 Mr Dutt has taken the plea that the petition was liable to be dismissed as it had not been made bona fide but for extraneous reasons and to create prejudice with a view to thwart statutory investigation
My brother Shelat has dealt with this aspect of the case fully and I cannot add anything useful to what he has said
The report was next considered by two Under Secretaries arid by the Secretary of the Company Law board who all agreed "that there was need for a deeper probe into the affairs of the Company"
In paragraphs 6 to 8 he has dealt with the legal aspects of the case
The learned Attorney General submitted that a distribution of business among the members of the Company Law Board is not a delegation of its authority, and the maxim has no application in 341 such a case
The first ground has already been dealt with in part when I considered the malice and influence of the Minister
