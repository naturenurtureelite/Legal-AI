B Dadachanji and section N Andley, for the appellant
Under Secretary to the Government of Bombay
2If you wish to make a representation against the order under which you are detained, you should address it to the Government of Bombay and forward it through the Superintendent, Arthur Road Prison, Bombay
Such a contention as to the mala fide exercise of the power is untenable in the present case having regard to the nature of the 393 grounds on which the detention is based and the nature of activities imputed therein to the appellant
But having regard to the nature of the alleged activities of the appellant, it is not unlikely that no more could be gathered or furnished
It does not appear that he applied to the Government to be supplied with particulars of the grounds furnished to him
Assuming however that the grounds furnished in this case are open to the challenge of vagueness, the further question which arises is whether the validity of the order of detention can be sustained by reason of the claim, in public interest, of non disclosure of facts made by the Under Secretary to the Government of Bombay by means of his affidavit filed in the High Court
These events happened between February to April, 1955
the Government, which for this purpose must be taken to be different from the police
The fact that be bad made no such application for particulars is, therefore, a circumstance which may well be taken into consideration, in deciding whether the grounds can be considered to be vague
But what has been urged before us is that the decision not to disclose the facts as well as the ambit of the non disclosure must be clearly communicated to the detenue at the time when the grounds are furnished
