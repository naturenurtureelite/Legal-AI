It may be stated that the relevant sections of the Travancore Act which govern the two appeals are identically worded with those of the Indian Incometax Act of 1922 (to be called the Indian Act)
259/58 the assessee is a public limited company incorporated in the State of Cochin with branches in that State as well as in what was British India and in Travancore State
260/58 the assessee is a private limited company with its registered office in the former Cochin State
It was carrying on business at its head office in Cochin State and it also carried on business in Travancore State
38,998 arising in Travancore State ? "
But then it was said that as the profits or gains of business in an Indian State were exempted from payment of tax in British India business in section 10 must mean business in British India
Appeals by special leave from the judgment and orders dated August 5, 1955, of the former Travancore Cochin High Court in Income tax Reference Appeals Nos
Rajagopala Sastri, R H Dhebar and D Gupta, for the appellant
It filed its incometax return showing an income of Rs
At the instance of the Commissioner of Income tax the following question was referred to the High Court of Travancore Cochin: Is the aforesaid sum of Rs
267 exception to the main enactment and exclude something which otherwise would have been within the section
That would be straining the language of section 10 and would necessitate addition of words in section 10 which are not there in the section
Counsel for the Revenue did not go to this extent that because profits were exempted losses could not be deducted; his argument was that because before 1939 income was not chargeable unless it was received or accrued in British India therefore business in section 10 could only mean business in British India
Section 3 provided for the charge of income tax in respect of the total income of the previous year
By the addition of this section the loss under one head of profits or gains was allowed to be set off against income, profits and gains under any other bead in any assessment year
Therefore to say that business in section 10 means business in British India or business the profits or gains of which are taxable in British India is to ignore the definitions and sections 3, 4 and 6
In the proviso in dispute there are no positive words which would support an interpretation in favour of the disintegration of the head " business " and compel the application of the proviso to the same head, specially keeping in view the object of the main section, ie
The assessee 's appeal to the Income tax Commissioner was unsuccessful but the Appellate Tribunal held that the banking business of the assessee being one and indivisible for the purpose of determining the amount assessable to income tax it was entitled to deduct the losses incurred outside Travancore State from the profits accruing and arising in that State
The Appellate Tribunal also did not accept the submissions of the assessee and upheld the order of assessment
Indeed it is not disputed that when profit and loss arose under the same head in any place which was not an Indian State recourse had to be had to the provisions of sections 7 to 12B and not to any other section
The main argument has been confined to the question of applicability of section 32(1) and the first proviso to that section of the Travancore Income tax Act (hereinafter called the Travancore Act)
The corresponding sections are as follows: Headings Sections in Section in Travancore Act
Indian Act
(Sections in brackets are the corresponding sections of the Indian Act)
In order to determine the true meaning of the words of the proviso it is necessary and convenient to refer to the scheme of the Indian Act which is admitted by the parties to be same as that of the Travancore Act
In 1939 the idea of 'total world income ' was introduced and the definition of 'total income ' was modified by the Indian Income tax (Amendment) Act (VII of 1939) which also made consequential changes in other sections of the Indian Act
Under section 2(15) of the Act total income ' was defined to mean the total amount of income, profits and gains computed in the manner laid down in that Act
Such sums were to be taken,into account for the purpose of determining the rate under section 16 of the Indian Act
that the intention of the Legislature was to restrict the set off of profits and losses arising in Indian States only to business or to modify the mode of computation under section 10 of the Indian Act
in Abdul Jabar Butt vs State of Jammu & Kashmir (1)
These two appeals by special leave raise a common question of law, and that is, whether business losses incurred in the erstwhile State of Cochin could, under the Income tax Act of Travancore, be set off against the business profits made in the erstwhile State of Travancore
A V Viswanatha Sastri and Naunit Lal, for the respondents in C A
This question was slightly modified by the High Court 260 which after referring to several decided cases answered the question in favour of the assessee
In our view the question referred to the High Court which is common to the two appeals was rightly answered in favour of the assessee
Lord Macmillan in Madras & Southern Mahratta Railway Co vs Bezwada Municipality (3) laid down the sphere of a proviso as follows : " The proper function of a proviso is to except and deal with a case which would otherwise fall within the general language of the main enactment, and its effect is confined to that case
The question for decision is as to how this proviso is to be construed
The mere fact that the word " income " is not used does not justify the construction
We should be averse to lend any countenance to such a mode of construing a proviso unless the language used expressly or by necessary intendment leads to that conclusion
