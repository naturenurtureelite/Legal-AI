ivil Appeal No 196 of 1 970
From the judgment and decree dated April 21, 1969 of the Allahabad High Court in First Appeal No 80 of 1964
ST Desai, ATM Sampath, Mukul Mudgal and Raju Ramachandran for the Appellants
RK Garg, Mrs Urmila Sirur and Shiv Pujan Singh, for the Respondents
(b) of clause (I) of Article 133 of the Constitution granted by the Allahabad High Court against its judgment and decree dated April 21, 1969 disposing of appeals out of a suit for declaration and possession
The plaintiffs filed a suit claiming that the property in dispute belonged to the Math Sauna or the deity Sri Thakur Gokarneshwar 661 Mahadeo Ji installed in the Math Sauna temple, and that Mahant Sadashiva Yati was in possession as Mahant and Sarbarakar
It was claimed that in the event of Mahant Sadashiva Yati being found out of possession a decree for possession should be made
Sadashiva Yati pleaded that on the death of Mahant Shivshanker Yati he was elected Mahant of Math Sauna and was, therefore, entitled as Sarbarakar to all the properties recorded in the deity Mahadeo Ji or in the name of Mahant Shivshanker Yati
These properties included properties in village Amauli
He asserted that Shivshanker Yati possessed no personal property
The suit was contested by the first defendant, Kedar Nath Chaubey, also referred to as Uma Shanker Yati
He alleged that Mahant Shivshanker Yati owned personal properties which included the properties in village Amauli, that he was the chela of Mahant Shivshanker Yati and the Amauli properties had passed to him under a will executed by the Mahant
We are concerned in this appeal solely with the Amauli properties
Math Sauna is an old Math situated in the village of that name in Tehsil Saidpur in the district of Ghazipur
One of the earliest Mahants of the Math Mahant Gokaran Yati, raised a temple in the premises of the Math and installed a deity acclaimed by the name of "Gokarneshwar Mahadeo"
On his death he was succeeded by Mahant Shivbaran Yati, who executed a waqf deed on November 12, 1892 dedicating various properties to the deity with the intent that arrangements for bhog, deepdan and other expenses be met from them
The surplus, the deed directed was to be employed for acquiring further property in the name of the deity and was not to be applied by the Sarbarakar to his personal use
The learned Civil Judge decreed the suit but included a finding in his judgment that Sadashiv Yati was not a regularly constituted Mahant of Math Sauna and Sarbarakar of the deity
Two appeals were filed in the High Court
First Appeal No 80 of 1964 was filed by Kedar Nath Chaubey @ Uma Shanker Yati against the declaration that the Amauli properties were owned by Math Sauna or the deity and that Sadashiv Yati was in possession thereof as Mahant and Sarbarakar
The other appeal, First Appeal No 270 of 1965 was filed by the plaintiffs for the relief that Sadashiv Yati was a properly constituted Mahant of Math Sauna and Sarbarakar of the deity
The High Court allowed both the appeals by its judgment and decree dated April 21, 1969
