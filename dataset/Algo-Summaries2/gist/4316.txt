Immediately after the award was pronounced, while the iron was still hot as it were, the employees apparently realised that the employer might take advantage of the circumstance that it was not clearly mentioned in the award that all the employees were to get additional pay of Rs. 150/ and Rs. 100/ respectively and might contend that the Tribunal had only revised the wage scales by increasing the salary on entry into the service and res 184 tructuring the scale of pay and never granted any ad hoc increase of salary to all employees.
The application before the Tribunal was filed under Rule 31 of the Bombay Industrial Disputes Rules 1957, which is as follows: "A Board, Court, Labour Court, Tribunal or Arbitrator may, at any time, suo moto or on an application made by any of the parties concerned, may correct any clerical mistake or error arising from an accidental slip or omission in any proceedings, report, award or as the case may be, decision".
In the case of several senior employees, the revised scale would yield but a very small and almost a token increase in the size of the pay packet whereas the junior employees would get a large benefit.
Thereafter various other matters were considered and finally the Tribunal revised the wage scales in the manner already mentioned by my brother Pathak, J.
The Tribunal then observed: ". the flat increase of Rs. 150/ in the category of Draftsmen and Rs. 100/ in the case of the other categories would be fair".
Likewise, if a flat increase of Rs. 100/ was given to individual workmen of all categories, including Draughtsmen, the increased financial load would total Rs. 7,64,256/ .
Civil Appeal No. 2300 of 1979 is dismissed.
None of the alternatives was actually adopted by the Tribunal, because when the award was made the Tribunal proceeded instead to restructure the wage scales by the addition of Rs. 150/ in the case of the category of Draughtsmen and Rs. 100/ in the case of other categories to the initial pay in the wage scales pertaining to those categories.
Civil Appeals Nos. 2299 and 2300 of 1979.
(iii) All other employees with more than one year 's service shall be given one increment".
1230 EB 60 1530.
The result of the foregoing discussion is that Civil Appeal No. 2299 of 1979 has to be dismissed in its entirety.
The order dated December 22, 1978 of the Tribunal also does not reveal that there was any opposition by the company to the application for correcting the award.
If the pay of an employee does not coincide with any step in the revised pay scale, and falls between two steps in the reclassified pay scales, the basic pay of that employee shall be fixed at the step higher in the revised scale.
If the dearness allowance is linked with the cost of living index the whole award will have to be reopened and the entire basis on which it has been made will have to be reconsidered.

The second contention of the appellant is entitled to succeed.
On December 22, 1978 that is to say, two days after the Award was made and when everything must have been fresh to the minds of the Tribunal, the respective parties and their Advocates, the employees Union made an application under Rule 31 of the Industrial Disputes (Bombay) Rules, 1957 seeking a correction of an error, which it was claimed, had crept into the Award.

After fixing the salary of the employees in the scales as above, the employees should be given increments in the new scales as noted below: (i) Employees who have completed 5 years or more as on 1st January, 1976, 3 increments.

For some years to come this is likely to be one of the few Consulting Engineers who will be securing major contracts".
On this application, the Advocate for the employer company made the following endorsement: "Submitted to whatever this Hon 'ble Tribunal desires to do".
The statement then goes on to indicate that if a flat increase of Rs. 75/ per month were given to individual workmen of all categories the total increase would be Rs. 5,78,220/ .
The omission of the words to each employee first after the figure Rs. 150/ and again after the figure Rs. 100/ was clearly an accidental slip or omission which the Tribunal was entitled to correct.
The application was as follows: "In the above reference your honour was pleased to pass an award on 20th December, 1978.
The original award was completed and signed by the Tribunal, and it cannot be reopened now except for the limited purpose of Rule 31.
The statement afforded an indication merely of what the additional financial load would be if a flat increase was given to the individual workman on the alternative basis set forth therein.
House rent allowance was also paid.
The only contention of the workmen is that the Tribunal should have fixed the dearness allowance in communion with the cost of living index.

The corrigendum amending the award in consequence is liable to be quashed.
In making the application of 22nd December, 1978, the Union invoked the jurisdiction of the 175 Tribunal under rule 31 of the Industrial Disputes (Bombay) Rules, 1957.
ORDER In view of the opinion of the majority both the appeals are dismissed and there is no order as to costs.
In travelling outside and beyond the terms of the original award, the Tribunal has committed a jurisdictional error.
No second flat increase was envisaged at all.
The revised pay scales of all categories, except the category of Draughtsmen, shows an increase of Rs. 100/ in the initial pay fixed in each scale, the increase in the case of the category of Draughtsmen being Rs. 150/ .
Implicit and intrinsically connected with the question of revision of the wage scales were the questions of fitment of employees into the wage scales and flat or ad hoc increase of salaries of workmen wherever considered necessary.
The Charter of Demands was presented by the Union in July, 1974 and when conciliation proceedings failed the State Government made the reference to the Industrial Tribunal in 1975.
However, this is not clearly mentioned anywhere in the award due to accidental slip or omission.
However, this is not clearly mentioned anywhere in the award due to accidental slip or omission.
In view of the increase so secured, the Tribunal rejected the suggestion that a slab system should be introduced in the dearness allowance or that there should be any other modification of the principle on which dearness allowance was being presently granted.
VI Draughtsman/Site Rs. 380 30 620 40 Rs. 530 40 730 50 Supervisor/ 1020 EB 50 1320.
In its order of 22nd December, 1978, the Tribunal has referred to the statement (Exhibit C 51) filed by the appellant when called upon to indicate the increased financial burden apprehended by it.
The amendment made by the Tribunal has the effect of providing a second increase, this time to each individual workmen.
Again, if the flat increase is Rs. 65/ per month to the individual workmen of all categories, the additional load would total Rs. 4,97,772/ .
The Tribunal then considered the question whether Draftsmen should get a higher flat increase and the question whether the existing scheme of Dearness Allowance should be revised.
Now, if, without any flat or ad hoc increase of salary, the workmen were to be fitted into the revised scales of pay, it would obviously result in serious anomalous situations.
There was no separate dearness allowance until January, 1977 when it was introduced for the first time.
Thereafter the Tribunal made an order on the same day in the following terms: "There can be no doubt that a flat increase of Rs. 150/ to each of the employees in the category of Draftsmen and 181 of Rs. 100/ to each employee in the other categories has been granted under my award.
Draughtsman Rs. 1000 50 1300 Rs. 1100 60 1340 (Diploma Holder) 60 1600 75 1750.
And that is confirmed by what was stated in paragraph 23 of the award: "Considering this outgoing the flat increase of Rs. 150/ in the category of Draughtsman and Rs. 100/ in the case of the other categories would be fair.
Considering the appeal of Tata Consulting Engineers first, the contention of learned counsel for the appellant is that having regard to the financial capacity of the appellant the Tribunal erred in making the wage scales retrospective and, in any event, in ranging the retrospectivity back to 1st January, 1976.

The Tribunal took note of the elaborate scales of wages already existing in the wage structure of the appellant and decided "to modify the existing structure of the scales with flat increases in each category.
In the said award, Your Honour has observed, at the end of Para 22, 'In view of the increase that is being allowed in the basic pay, I do not propose to revise the existing scheme of Dearness Allowance '.
