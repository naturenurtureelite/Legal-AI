During the extended period of the contract conditions of service of officers shall remain same as are mentioned under their Appointment Order.
The order passed on review is wholly unsustainable.

Even the order passed on Review on 26.7.1988 does not make out that the respondent had put forward at that stage such a case.
In the Penultimate paragraph of the judgment the High Court further stated: "It is open for the opposite parties to con sider the claim of the petitioner for continu ation in service or of fresh appointment and no observations in this regard are being made by this Court.
No costs.
The said term was extended retrospectively, first upto 20th August, 1982 by an order passed in September, 1981 and it 'was again extended upto 31st March, 1983 by an order made in February, 1983.
" The contention of the respondent was that the said interim order entitled him to be reinstated in service irrespective of the fact whether the Governor had extended the period of his appointment beyond 30th of August, 1985.
243 The respondent who was not satisfied by the order allow ing the Writ Petition as stated above preferred a Review Petition before the High Court contending that he was enti tled to be reinstated in service on the pronouncement of the Judgment on 24.3.
But on 29.3.1985 the service of the 1st Respondent was terminated by the issue of a notice and payment of one month 's salary.
245 In the circumstances, we feel that while the High Court was right in disposing of the Writ Petition on 24.3.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMIAH, CJ.
His only case was that the interim order that had been passed on 10.7.86 entitled him to be reinstated in service even though there was no order of extension of service.
