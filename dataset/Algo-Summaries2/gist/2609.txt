Mr. section V. Gupte, for the petitioners, points out that the ;Constitution is speaking of State and Union territory.
120 The clause thus enables Parliament to make a law in a special case prescribing any requirement As to residence within a State or Union territory prior to appointment, as a condition of employment in the State or Union territory.
The second clause then specifies a prohibition against discrimination only on the grounds of religion, race, sex, descent, place of birth, residence or any of them.
Under section 5 the Rules had a life of 5 years but by subsequent legislation the period was extended to 10 years.
L12 Sup Cl/69 9 122 For the reasons given above we quash the orders passed and declare section 3 of the Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence) Act, 1957 as also Rule 3 of the Rules ultra vires the Constitution.
section V. Gupte, P. A. Choudhury and K. Rajendra Chaudhuri, for the petitioners.
Petition under article 32 of the Constitution of India for enforcement of fundamental rights.
We accept the argument of Mr. Gupte that the Constitution, as it stands, speaks of a whole State as the venue for residential qualification and it is impossible to think that the Constituent Assembly was thinking of residence in Districts, Taluqas, cities, towns or villages.
By the second clause, there can be no discrimination, among other things, on the ground of residence.
This clause was amended by the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956.
(3) of article 16 of the Constitution making special provision for requirement as to residence and brought into force on March 21, 1959.
For this reason section 3 of the Act is challenged as ultra vires the Constitution.
The claim of Mr. Setalvad that Parliament can make a provision regarding residence in any particular part of a State would render the general prohibition lose all its meaning.
