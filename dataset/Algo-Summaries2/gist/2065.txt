" What was said by the Privy Council about the impropriety of including an execution sale within the meaning of article 134B can, with equal justification, be said about introducing words of limitation in the said article which alone can exclude transfers made by the previous manager of the Hindu religious endowment on the basis that the property transferred belonged to (1) L.R. 77 I.A. 42 at pp.
Column 1 of article 134 B provides for suits brought, inter alia, by the manager of a Hindu religious or charitable endowment to recover possession of immovable property comprised in the endowment which has been transferred by a previous manager for a valuable consideration.
Mr. Tatachari then contends that even on the application of article 134 B, the decision of the High Court is erroneous, because on the facts proved in this case, the High Court should have drawn the legal inference that the transferor had been removed more than 12 years before the suit was filed.

The appellants ' case before the trial Court was that Pachaikandaswamiar had resigned his position about 27 years ago, and that even if article 134 B applied, limitation should be held to have commenced from the date when the alienor either resigned his office or was removed from it.
As trustees appointed by respondent No. 4, they claimed that they were entitled to the possession of the properties.

This suit (No. 103 of 1954) was instituted on the 13th September, 1954, under section 87 of the, Madras Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act (No. XIX of 1951) (hereinafter called 'the Act '), in the Court of the District Munsif at Turaiyur.

This notice was served on witness Raju lyer and Amrithalinga lyer, Chinnasamy Iyer, and Rangaraja Reddiar, who were performing the worship and acting as de facto managers of the temple.
