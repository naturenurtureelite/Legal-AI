The High Court has upheld the action of the Public Service Commission and has dismissed the writ petitions.
We have heard counsel for the parties and are of the view that when no defect was pointed out in regard to the written examination and the sole objection was confined to exclusion of a group of successful candidates in the written examination from the interview, there was no justification for cancelling the written part of the recruitment examina tion.
The State Public Service Commission should have been more careful in dealing with the matter so that four years in the process of recruitment would not have been lost and the public cause would not have suffered; public time would not have been wasted in requiring re doing of what had once been done and the litigation could have been avoided.
1573 1/1987 & 12373/1987.
There shall be no order as to costs.
R.B. Mehrotra for the Respondent.
After the written examina tion was over, on the basis of the results thereof success ful candidates upto a base limit have to be called to be interviewed.
R.K. Garg, S.P. Singh, N.M. Popli, R.B. Misra, Uma Nath Misra and R.C. Kaushik for the Appellants.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MISRA, J.
