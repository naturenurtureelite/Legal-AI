The service of order of detention on the petitioner while he was in jail was futile and useless since such an order had no application under section 3(2) of the Act.
His representation, was duly considered and rejected.
Charge sheet No. 25/84 has already been submitted in this case.
The series of offences against the detenu and the manner of their perpetuation, which have been noted before, indicate a calculated move to create panic and fear in the mind of the people.
In the affidavits on behalf of the detaining authority though there are indications that transfer of the detenu from one prison to another was considered but the need to serve the detention order while he was in custody was not properly considered by the detaining authority in the light of the relevant factors.

The order of detention, therefore, is set aside.

N: Criminal Appeal No. 317 of 1986 From the Judgment and order dated 27.2.1986 of the Patna High Court in C.W.J.C. No. 33 of 1986.
Criminal Appeal No. 317 of 1986 arises out of the judgment and order of the High Court of Patna and the Writ Petition No. 316 is in respect of the same detenu.
A bald statement is merely an ipso dixit 912 of the officer.
In the affidavit of the District Magistrate, the detaining authority, it has been stated that the activities of the petitioner 's brother and the petitioner have disturbed the normal tempo of life in Katras and Jogta Police Stations in Dhanbad area.
There is no statement in the petition that the detenu is on bail.
On or about 2nd January, 1985 the order of detention was passed on an incident relating to the exchange of fire between two rival groups.
From the affidavit of the District Magistrate it does not appear that either the prospect of immediate release of the detenu or other factors which can justify the detention of a person in detention were properly considered in the light of the principles noted in the aforesaid decision and especially in the decisions, in Rameshwar Shaw vs District Magistrate, Burdwan & Anr., ; and Ramesh Yadav vs District Magistrate Etah and others, though there was a statement to the effect that the petitioner was in jail and was likely to be enlarged on bail.
There is no indication that this factor or the question that the said detenu might be released or that there was such a possibility of his release, was taken into consideration by the detaining authority properly and seriously before the service of the order.
This, how ever, will not affect detenu 's detention under the criminal cases.
At the relevant time the petitioner was undertrial in the said criminal case.
Judged on the basis of 911 the said principles there is no ground for interference with the order of detention as passed.
909 Charge sheet No. 20/85 has already been submitted in this case.
910 It is the contention of the petitioner/appellant that the order of preventive detention could only be justified against a person in detention if the detaining authority was satisfied that his release from detention was imminent and the order of detention was necessary for putting him back in jail.
