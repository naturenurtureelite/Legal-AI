It is true that Ujagar Singh did not rush to the village at once and convey the news of the murder of Sheo Sahai There is no enmity between Ujagar Singh and the appellant and therefore no good reasons existed for Ujagar Singh to state falsely The Canal runs beside Ujagar Singh 's field This tends to support Ujagar Singh 's statement that the appellant had a bath in the Canal at that hour The evidence of the appellant 's having enmity with Sheo Sahai, the appellant 's conduct in purchasing a sword and delivering it stained with human blood to the Police and the appellant 's confession to Ujagar Singh, fully establish that the appellant did commit the murder of Sheo Sahai Ujagar Singh was on the field for the purpose of watching it against the neel gais trespassing and grazing the crop The extra judicial confession of the appellant to Ujagar Singh finds ample support from the facts that the appellant did purchase a sword a day before, that very sword was found to be stained with human blood shortly after the murder and that sword was handed over by the appellant himself to the Police Officer at the Police Station
