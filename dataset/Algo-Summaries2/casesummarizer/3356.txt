If the witness is absolutely reliable there can be no infirmity in convicting the accused The High Court acquitted accused Jabamani Nadar alias Kanyakumari Comrade alias Ramu and accepted the reference in respect of the present accused He further saw his two brothers, Gnanasakaran (PW 1) and Thiru gnanasambandam (PW 3) along with Ramasamy (PW 2) chasing them He got up and saw the accused Karunakaran running on the eastern bank of the channel with a knife 8 inches long 709 The police had submitted charge sheet under section 302/34 IPC against the present accused and accused Jabamani Nadar alias Kanyakumari Comrade alias Ramu and Thamizharasan alias Ramaswami, who was shown as an absconder Assuming that his earlier version in the first information report is true that the deceased chased the accused  Even so, later on four eye witnesses were produced implicating not only the present accused but also two other accused The electric lights were burning in the vicinity He also saw two persons running ahead of accused Karunakaran He did not at all refer to the deceased chasing him But the fact that the witness has stated in the first information report that the deceased was only mentioning the name of accused Karunakaran as his assailant, this earlier version appears to be contradicted by the medical evidence There is considerable doubt as to this testimony with regard to seeing the accused running away from the place of occurrence If the statement of PW 4 is to be believed, the crowd had gathered at the place of occurrence already when he arrived on the sole testimony of a single witness We do not find in this case a single witness out of that crowd produced in court for the purpose of corroborating PW 4 has absolutely no motive to implicate the first accused" assailants when he came running to the place of occurrence It was also observed that the High Court "can place no reliance on the testimony of PW 4 in so far as he implicated the second accused and Tharnizharasan in the case of murder of Viswanatham"
