We had told Mahabir as above before we had read the application and affidavit presented before the Nyaya Panchayat , the Nyaya Panchayats proceeded with the case It seems to us that it is not proved on the evidence here that any such application was made before the Nyaya Panchayat At any rate, he has apparently no jurisdiction to stay proceedings before the Nyaya Panchayats when no Proceeding is pending before him Bunna Prasad, in his affidavit, stated that as the Nyaya Panchayat was not satisfied for want of evidence by way of proper affidavit etc 117 It is alleged on the side of the applicant, Mahabir, that immediately after the receipt of the telegram an application accompanied by an affidavit and the telegram of his counsel in the High Court was presented before the Nyaya Panchayat with the prayer to stay further proceedings but the Sarpanch refused to take it On September 10, 1963, the Nyaya Panchayat assembled and evidence was led before it The High Court held : "There was no reasonable ground for the Panchas to have doubted the averments made in the application and affidavit of Mahabir that the High Court had stayed further proceedings before the Panchayat, nor is there any thing in the order sheet to show that the Panchas did not believe the contents of the application, and affidavit of Mahabir Affidavits were filed in the High Court by Baldeo Prasad, pairokar of Mahabir, Burma Prasad, the Sarpanch, and Mahabir, and statements of Phagu Prasad and Bunna Prasad were recorded on oath It was no part of the duty of the Panchas to enquire from the SDM But the Panchas did nothing of the kind No application dated December 21, 1963, which was not accepted by the Nyaya Panchayat, has been produced Panchayat Raj Act, 1947, to SDM, Deoria, to transfer the proceedings on the ground that the complainant Yashoda was father of Bunna Prasad, Sarpanch of Nyaya Panchayat, Jokha Khas In the alternative, they should have verified from the Sub Divi sional Magistrate whether Mahabir had really filed an application and affidavit before him along with the original telegram received from his counsel at Allahabad saying that the High Court had already stayed the proceedings before the Nyaya Panchayat In the affidavit accompanying the application, however, no mention was made about Mahabir having informed the Panchayat Adalat of the stay order or the fact that the order and the application was not being entertained by the Adalat It seems to us that the High Court did not appreciate that the so called affidavit which was filed before the Panchas was in fact not an affidavit at all
