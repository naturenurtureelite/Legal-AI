All be says about Tukaram and Nilia is that"The accused present were striking Ramchander; Pandurang, Bhilia and Tukia were holding axes 1096 Bhilia, Tukia and Nilia are Lambadas, Pandurang is a Hatkar and Tukaram a Maratha Tukaram and Nilia had sticks in their bands" Rasika Bai shouted out to the assailants not to beat Ramchander but they threatened her and then ran away It is also possible that Nilia did hit out at Ramchander but that the blow did not land on his body Rasika says that one of them, Nilia, hit Ramchander on the thigh with his stick and assigns no particular blow to the other We are prepared to disregard the evidence of Rasika and Subhana in so far as they say that Tukaram and Nilia also beat Ramchander because the medical evidence does not disclose any injuries which could have been caused by a stick or sticks Rasikabai and Subhana are agreed that the only person who struck on the cheek is Tukia That leaves the question of sentence in the case of Bhilia and Tukia Rasikabai adds that he also hit Ramchander on the bead Anyway, Rasika Bai heard shouts from that direction, so she ran to the river bank with Subhana and they both say that they saw all five accused attacking Ramchander with axes and sticks Narsabai tells us that the three accused Nilia, Bhilia and Tukia, all of whom are Lambadas used to live in that field The Police Patel tells us that this Tukaram is a cousin of the deceased Subhana does not say that the other two struck any particular blow As a matter of fact Subhana does not ascribe any particular blow either to Tukaram or to Nilia though he does describe in detail what the other three did They say they saw all five accused striking him, the three appellants Pandurang, Tukia and Bhilia with axes, the other two, who have not appealed, with sticks The important thing is that both witnesses are agreed on the following points (1) that Tukia struck Ramchander on his cheek; 1087 Rasika Bai adds that he also struck him on the head; (2) that Pandurang hit him on the head; (3) that after these blows Ramchander fell down and then Bhilia hit him on the neck Pandurang, Tukia and Bhilia, who were sentenced to death, applied here for special leave to appeal Now even if it be accepted that this evidence is indicative of prior concert, it only embraces the three Lambadas, Nilia, Bhilia and Tukia
