gifts, the entries in the books did not complete the gift in whose accounts gifts are effected have overdraft facilities on the date of the gift, then a valid gift by book entries might be possible

in certain circumstances for a donor to make a valid gift by instructing a firm or a company or a HUF The assessee must also have sufficient credit balance to enable him to make the gift In order to constitute a valid gift there must be an existing property In the case of banking companies or other firms and companies who have overdraft facilities, even if the sums are not in credit of the donor

made a gift of Rs50,000 to his son and this amount should be excluded from his taxable net wealth But in the cases of non banking companies or firms, if these companies or firms do not have overdraft

of the firm whose accounts are said to be credited or debited The Court, however, pointed out that it was held that there was no valid gift on the date of the entries, then it could not be held that, subsequently, when the money was transferred by further entries in the same books, it resulted in a valid gift C was not in a position to make gifts in cash of the amounts credited in favour of his wife and relatives The circumstances must be such as to make it clear that there were sufficient funds at the disposal of the donor by reason of which he could make the gift by such book entries On
