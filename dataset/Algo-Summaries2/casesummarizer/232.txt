Here is classification But what then becomes of the classification? His contention is that offences may be grouped into two classes, namely, those that require speedier trial, that is speedier than what is provided for in the Code and those that do not require a speedier trial The Attorney General argued that if the principle of classification has to be applied as a necessary test, there is a classification in the impugned Act as it says that it is intended to provide for the speedier trial of certain offences; and in the opinion of the legislature certain offences may require more expeditious trial than other offences and this was a good enough classification The differen tia and the object being, as I have said, different ele ments, it follows that the object by itself cannot be the basis of the classification of offences or the cases, for, in the absence of any special circumstances which may dis tinguish one offence or one class of offences or one class of cases from another offence, or class of offences or class of cases, speedier trial is desirable in the disposal of all offences or classes of offences or classes of cases Ellis; , 41 314 Speedier trial of offences may be the reason and motive for the legislation but it does not amount either to a classification of offences or of cases This is not a reasonable classification at all but an arbitrary selection The first thing to be noticed is that the preamble of the Act mentions speedier trial of certain offences as its object The Court is expressly empowered to convict a person of an offence with which he was not charged if it transpires from the evidence adduced at the time of trial that such offence was committed by him, and it is immaterial that the offence is not a minor offence The Act is intituled "An Act to provide for the speedier trial of certain offences ", and the preamble declares that "it is expedient to provide for the speedier trial of cer tain offences " The provision for the speedier trial of certain offences is, therefore, the object of the Act The Act accordingly empowers the State government to direct the offences, which, in its view, require speedier trial, to be tried by a Special Court according to the special procedure provided by it for the speedier trial of those offences The preamble of the Act under consideration recites the expediency of providing for the speedier trial of certain 341 offences Minor offences can be summarily tried, while for grave and heinous offences an elaborate mode of procedure has been laid down The Code of Criminal Procedure has by the process of classification prescribed different modes of procedure for trial of different of fences It is not stated that it is only when speedier trial is necessary that the discretion should be exercised What, after all, is classification? The argument is that although there is no apparent reason why an offence of theft in a dwelling house by a stranger should require speedier trial any more than an offence of theft in a dwelling house by a servant should do, the State government may nevertheless select the former offence for special and discriminatory treatment in the matter of its trial by bringing it under the Act The emphasis is on "offences", ' 'classes of offences" or "classes of cases" 309 (3) Certain offences belonging to a particular group or category of offences may be tried under the Act whereas other offences belonging to the same group or category may be tried under the Code Indeed, it does not by its own force make the special procedure provided in the Act applicable to the trial of any offence or classes of offences or classes of cases; for, it is the State Government 's notification under the section that attracts the application of the procedure The liability to be convicted of a higher offence has no parallel in the Code And when it is intended to provide that they should be tried more speedily than other offences, requiring in certain respects a departure from the procedure prescribed for the general class of offences, it is but reasonable to expect the legis lature to indicate the basis for any such classification He first draws our attention to the fact that the Act is inti tuled "An Act to provide for the speedier trial of certain offences" and then points out that the purpose of the Act, as stated in its preamble, also is "to provide for the speedier trial of certain offences" be construed as meaning cases requiring speedier trial" But the question is: how is this necessi ty of speedier trial to be determined ? It is true that the trial by jury is not guaranteed by the Constitution and section 269(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code empowers the State Government to direct that the trial of all offences or any particular class of offences before any sessions court shall be by jury in any district; and it may revoke or alter such orders This classification may be on different bases The learned Attorney General urges that the principle of classification upon which the differences have been made between cases and offences triable by the Special Court and those by ordinary courts is indicated in the preamble to the Act which runs as follows: "Whereas it is expedient to provide for the speedier trial of certain offences" The Act, according to him, purports to deal only with offences of the first class Broadly speak ing, their classification of the offences for the purpose of applying these different sets of provisions was according to the gravity of the offences, though in classifying the offences fit for summary trial the experience and power of the trying Magistrate was also taken into consideration That the Act has prescribed a procedure of trial which is materially different from that laid down in the Code of Criminal Procedure cannot be disputed Persons concerned in offences or cases needing so called speedier trial are entitled to inquire "Why are they being made the subject of a law which has short circuited the normal procedure of trial; why has it grouped them in that category and why has the law deprived them of the protection and safeguards which are allowed in the case of accused tried under the procedure mentioned in the Criminal Procedure Code; what makes the legislature or the executive to think that their cases need speedier trial than those of others like them?" This differentia quite clearly has a reasona ble relation to the object sought to be achieved by the Act, namely, the speedier trial of certain offences They could be told that the law regards persons guilty of offences against the security of the State as a class in themselves Such a classification will not be 344 repugnant to the equal protection clause of our Constitution for there will be no discrimination, for whoever may commit the specified offence in the specified area in the specified circumstances will be treated alike and sent up before a Special Court for trial under the special procedure If the Act does not enunciate any principle on the basis of which the State Government could select offences or classes of offences or cases or classes of cases and the State Government is left free to make 358 any arbitrary selection according to their will and pleasure then the Act is void I have already held, as a matter of construction, that section 5 (1)vests a discretion in the State Government to refer to a special court for trial such offences or classes of offences or 301 cases or classes of cases as may, in its opinion, require a speedier trial Here the law lays an unequal hand on those who have committed intrinsically the same quality of offence The 308 framers of the Code appear to have been generally of the view that the graver the offence the more elaborate should be the procedure for its trial, which was undoubtedly an understandable point of view, and no one has suggested that their classification of offences for the four different modes of trial to which reference has been made is unreason able in any sense In other words, section 5 (1) must, in my opinion, be read as empowering the State Government to direct a special court to try such offences or classes of offences or cases or classes of cases as, in its judgment, require speedier trial Those singled out for treatment under the 316 procedure of the Special Act are to a considerable extent prejudiced by the deprivation of the trial by the procedure prescribed under the Criminal Procedure Code It may be that in making the selection the authorities would exclude from the list of offences other offences of a cognate character in respect to which no difference in treatment is justifiable has taken the view that section 5 of the Act would have been unexceptionable had it only provided for the trial by a Special Court of certain of fences or classes of offences or certain classes of cases and that in his opinion the discrimination arose by the provision for the trial of cases, as distinguished from classes of cases Classifications condemned as discriminatory have been subsequently upheld as being within the powers of the legislature The necessity for speedier trial may be the object which the legislature had in view or it may be the occasion for making the enactment (2) An accused person charged with a particular of fence may be tried under the Act while another accused person charged with the same offence may be tried under the Code Turning to the pream ble, I find that the object of the Act is "to provide for the speedier trial of certain offences" and not of a partic ular case or cases I have already stated that this part of the sub section contemplates a process of classification of "of fences", "classes of offences" and "classes of cases" Even if this difference in the circum stances of the two alleged offenders can be made the basis of a classification, there is no nexus between this differ ence and the object of the Act, for, in the absence of any special circumstances, there is no apparent reason why the offence of theft in a dwelling house by a stranger should require a speedier trial any more than the offence of theft by a servant should do The mere fact of classification is not sufficient to relieve a statute from the reach of the equality clause of article 14 These expressions clearly indi cate, and obviously imply, a process of classification of offences or cases 329 sort of classification has been attempted at will not re lieve a statute from the reach of the equality clause To achieve this object, offences or cases have to be classified upon the basis of some differentia which will distinguish those offences or cases from others and which will have a reasona ble relation to the recited object of the Act
