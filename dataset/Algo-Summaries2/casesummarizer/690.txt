section 24(1) which was to set off loss of profits or gains under one head against income, profits or gains under any other head The assesse made a profit in Travancore State and incurred a loss in the State of Cochin and sought to deduct this loss from the profit of Travancore State thus showing a net profit of Rs By the addition of this section the loss under one head of profits or gains was allowed to be set off against income, profits and gains under any other bead in any assessment year In 1941 income, profits or gains which a resident made in an Indian State and in the case of Travancore State income, profits or gains which a resident made in British India or other Indian States were exempted from payment of income tax unless received or brought into the respective territories, but this income, profits or gains had to be included for the purpose of calculating the rate 263 there were six heads of income chargeable to income tax From 1922 to 1939 in order to be taxable income, profits and gains had to be received or had to accrue in British India In cases where profits and losses arose under the same head they had to be adjusted against each other The 'total world income ' was defined as including all income, profits and gains wherever accruing or arising except income to which the Act did not apply 79,275 a loss of the assessee arising outside the Travancore State for purpose of the first proviso to section 32(1) of the Travancore Income tax Act ? " 34 266 determining profits and gains of the business of any resident The Income tax Officer determined its assessable income to be Rs Thus the mere use of the words loss of profits or gains to be, set off against profits and gains would not be sufficient to restrict the scope of the proviso to the profits and losses arising under the head business in the two territories, i e, British India and the Indian States That proviso shows that where the Legislature wanted to restrict the losses and profits or gains to business alone they specifically said so 38,998 arising in Travancore State ? " They could only be adjusted against profits arising in an Indian State or in the case of Travancore State in British India or another Indian State A review of the various sections and enactments shows that during 1922 1939 the tax was leviable on income, profits and gains arising or accruing to an assessee in British India This section was introduced in 1922 before which under the Indian Act of 1918 a loss under one head of income could not be set off against income under another head, the taxability of income arising from each head being separate But then it was said that as the profits or gains of business in an Indian State were exempted from payment of tax in British India business in section 10 must mean business in British India But it was contended on behalf of the Revenue that the first proviso to section 24(1) of the Indian Act not only affected the generality of the main enactment but also introduced an addendum that where the profits of the business arose in what was British India in the case of the Indian Act or what was Travancore State in the case of the Travancore Act and the losses under the head business were sustained in an Indian State or in the latter case in any other Indian State or British India, these losses could not by virtue of the proviso be deducted from profits made in British India or Travancore State as the case may be Section 4(3) provided what income, profits or gains were not to be included in the total income of the person receiving them 79,275 shown as loss from branches situate outside the State of Travancore, in British India and other Indian States It was carrying on business at its head office in Cochin State and it also carried on business in Travancore State The assessee 's appeal to the Income tax Commissioner was unsuccessful but the Appellate Tribunal held that the banking business of the assessee being one and indivisible for the purpose of determining the amount assessable to income tax it was entitled to deduct the losses incurred outside Travancore State from the profits accruing and arising in that State 90,947 representing only the profit it made in Travancore State and under section 32(1) proviso (1) of the Travancore Act he refused a deduction of Rs It was then submitted that in the proviso the words used were " where the loss sustained is a loss of profits or gains " and therefore it necessarily applied to the head " business " in the two respective territories These two appeals by special leave raise a common question of law, and that is, whether business losses incurred in the erstwhile State of Cochin could, under the Income tax Act of Travancore, be set off against the business profits made in the erstwhile State of Travancore The main argument has been confined to the question of applicability of section 32(1) and the first proviso to that section of the Travancore Income tax Act (hereinafter called the Travancore Act) It is expanded no doubt into " income, profits and gains " but the expansion is more a matter of words than of substance " The Privy Council in Arunachalam Chettiar vs Commissioner of Income tax(1) held that this section was meant for a set off of profits arising under different heads and not where profits and losses had to be adjusted if they arose under the same head In 1941 during the war an exemption was given for the purpose of taxability to any income, profits or gains which accrued or arose within what was then called Indian States but which were not received or brought into British India Section 3 provided for the charge of income tax in respect of the total income of the previous year
