value of the exports value of exports value under the Import & Export Policy 1978 79 The aforesaid examination of the provisions contained in the Import & Export Policy 1978 79 and the Import & Export Policy 1988 91 shows that while in the Import & Export Policy 1978 79 the emphasis was only on the fob They cannot claim to be entitled to the same facilities that have been provided to Export Houses who are granted Additional licences under the Import & Export Policy 1988 91 In other words, under the Import & Export Policy of 1978 79 the basis for grant of Export House Certificate as well as grant of Additional licences to Export Houses was the fob A close examination of the Import & Export Policy 1978 79 under which the petitioners have been granted the Additional licences and the Import & Export Policy 1988 91 shows that there is material difference between the conditions for grant of Additional licences under Import Policy 1978 79 and the conditions for grant of such licences under the Import Policy 1988 91 and it cannot be said that the petitioners who have been granted Additional licences under the Import & Export Policy 1978 79 and the Export & Import Policy 1988 91 are persons similarly circumstanced The Import & Export Policy 1988 1991 also contains in para 214 and 215 provisions for grant of Additional licences to Export Houses 248 Here we find that in the Import & Export Policy 1988 91 there has been relaxation to a limited extent in respect of import by Export Houses who are granted Additional licences under the said Policy on the basis of their exports during that period 1987 88 and subsequent periods It has been submitted that this licence has also been issued under the Import & Export Policy 1978 79 on the basis of the fob Under the Import & Export Policy 1978 79, there were two requirements for grant of Additional license: one was the condition as to eligibility for registration as an Export House and grant of Export House Certificates; and the other was the basis for issuing the Additional licences to Export House which had been granted Export House Certificates They would be entitled to import items which were canalised or not if the import policy prevailing at the time of import permitted them to import items falling under such category These observations only indicate that import of the canalised items under Additional licences issued to Export Houses, like the petitioners, would be permissible if the import policy prevailing at the time of import permits them to import such items On behalf of the respondents it has been submitted by the learned Additional Solicitor General that there is no similarity between the petitioners who have been granted Additional licences on the basis of their exports made during the period 1977 78 in accordance with the Import Policy 1978 79 and the Export Houses who would be granted Additional licences on or after April 1, 1988, under the Import & Export Policy 1988 91 inasmuch as the conditions of eligibility for grant of such licences and the value of licences under the Import & Export Policy 1978 79 were quite different from those contained in the Import & Export Policy 1988 91 value of the exports of select products made by the Export House in the year 1977 78 1988 shall cease to be valid for import of any item which could be imported under Open General Licence under the Import Export Policy, 1985 88 but are no longer so in this Policy This indicates that under the Import & Export Policy 1988 91 for the purposeof grant of Export House Certificate as well as Additional licences the emphasis is on the net foreign exchange earnings made by the Export House, which means that the value of the imports made by the Import House for the purpose of exporting goods is to be excluded from the fob It has been urged that under Import & Export Policy 1978 79 Additional licences were to be given on the basis of one third of the fob In para 215 of the said Policy certain additional facilities have been given in the matter of imports by Export Houses under Additional licences issued to them The petitioners submitted application for registration as Export Houses and for grant of Export House Certificate which would have entitled them to the grant of such Additional licence value of the exports made in 1977 78 whereas under Import & Export Policy 1988 91 Additional licences are to be given on the basis of not foreign exchange earnings from the exports actually made and the value of such Additional licence is only 10 to 12% of the net foreign exchange earnings It has been submitted that all Export houses who have been granted Additional licences constitute a single class and that there is no basis for classifying such Export Houses into two different categories on the basis of the date of issuance of the Additional Licences or on the basis of the period of the exports against which such licences have been issued and that such a classification has no connection whatsoever with the object sought to be achieved by the Import & Export Policy 1988 91 Ltd wherein it is stated that this licence is valid for import of items as per para 215 of Import & Export Policy 1988 91 subject to restrictions/conditions laid down therein Salve, has, however, urged that in view of the decision of this Court in D Navinchandra & Co case (supra) the Export Houses who were granted Additional licences under the Import & Export Policy 1978 79 have to be treated at par with Export Houses who have been granted Additional licences under the Import & Export Policy for the subsequent years and since there has been relaxation in the matter of policy of canalisation of imports under sub para (4) of 246 para 215 in respect of Additional licences granted to Export Houses under the Import & Export Policy 1988 91, the petitioners are also entitled to a similar relaxation It was held that the Export Hoses could not import Dry Fruits in view of the said restriction placed in the Import Policy 1985 88 That apart even the value of the Additional licences which can be issued under the Import & Export Policy 1988 91 on the basis of NFE earnings is much less viz value of the exports, without taking into account the value of the goods imported by them for achieving the exports value of admissible exports minus the cif The Import & Export Policy for the period April 1978 to March 1979, in para 174, made provision for grant of certain import facilities to Export Houses which were registered in accordance with the provisions of the said Policy The provisions conferring flexibility in the matter of imports contained in sub para (4) of para 215 of the Import & Export Policy 1988 91 are intended to give an incentive to Export Houses to increase the exports in a way as to enhance the net foreign exchange earnings of the country These licences will also cease to be valid for the import of items of capital goods which appeared in Appendix 1 Part B of Import Export Policy, 1985 88 but are now covered by Appendix 1 Part B of this Policy
