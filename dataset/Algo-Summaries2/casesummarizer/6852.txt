Presumption as to specified poisons: Any substance specified as a poison in a rule made or notification issued under this Act shall be deemed to be a poison for the purpose of this Act
" Nothing is a poison unless regard be had to its administration Some substances were includ ed in the Rules made in 1926 as poisons and that is not in dispute It is also not necessary that the same substance should be declared as poison for the entire country Of course no comprehensive definition can be given to the word poison In other words, it is intended to control over the traffic in poisons The Act is intended to regulate the importation, possession and sale of poisons Any substance which is used for purposes mentioned therein can definitely be declared as poison Originally the Act contained a schedule in which the list of substances declared as poisons were listed Substances harmless in themselves might become poison by the time or manner of their adminis tration A substance may be a deadly poison or a valuable medicine according to how and how much is taken The nature of trade in poison is such that nobody can be considered to have an absolute right to carry on the same When this Act 1/1904 was repealed and re enacted as Poison Act 12 of 1919 the definition was omitted and speci fied substances were included in the schedule with a power vested in the State Government to amend the same by Rules including other substances to the list of poisons The object of the enactment is to regulate the posses sion for sale and the sale, whether wholesale or retail of poisons and the importation of the same Section 2 224 also enables the Government by Rule to regulate the posses sion for sale and the sale of the specified poison Section 4 of the Act impliedly sets out certain guidelines when the State can notify a substance as poison Rule 2 was amended as already stated including 'thinner ' of the description mentioned therein as poison Governor of Delhi amended the Delhi Poisons Rules, 1926 (hereinafter called the Rules) by including to the list of substances included in the Rules as "Poisons" "the substance commonly known 222 as 'thinner ' containing spirit and other soluble material such as shellac in which the percentage of such soluble material does not exceed 30%" as poison and consequential amendment of rules 12 and 13 of the Rules Later when Delhi Poisons Rules, 1926 were made in exercise of the powers under the Act those list of substances were included in the list enumerated in Rule 2 thereof It states that the State Government may by rule regulate the posses sion of any specified poison in any local area in which the use of such poison for the purpose of committing murder or mischief by poisoning cattle appears to it to be of such frequent occurrence as to render restriction on the posses sion thereof desirable Though the original enactment, the Poisons Act, 1904 was restrict ed, it was applicable to white arsenic, the expanded its provisions and enabled State Government to declare any substance as poison for the purposes of the Act by a notification under the Act or the rules made under the Act The petitioner 's have also taken the plea that though the Act is a Central enactment it is possible of unjust and unjustified discriminatory appli cation as it is left to each State Government to determine what substance they would include as poison and regulated and the decision in one State to include the substance as poison is not automatically made applicable to the other States
