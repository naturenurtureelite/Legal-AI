The presumption is stronger when the discovery of the fruits of crime is made immediately after the crime is According to him there is no other evidence in the case which points, to the complicity of the 14 appellants in the crime of dacoity and therefore as they cannot be suspected to be dacoits themselves, the only presumption to be drawn is one of receivers of stolen property or as receivers of property which was stolen in a dacoity It is only when the accused cannot be connected with the crime except by reason of possession of the fruits of crime that the presumption may be drawn There is then no question of presumption In these searches cloth which was undoubtedly stolen at the time of the dacoity was found in their houses It is impossible to think that these 20 persons were merely receivers of stolen property from some other 20 persons who were the dacoits If there is other evidence, to connect an accused with the crime itself, however small, the finding of the stolen property with him is a piece of evidence which connects him further with the crime It appears that four out of the six carts escaped, but two carts were looted It is legitimate therefore to raise the presumption in this case that the persons with whom the goods were found were the dacoits themselves It all depends upon the circumstances under which the discovery of the fruits of crime are made with a particular accused In this appeal, the only contention raised by Mr A section R Chari is that the presumption that they were dacoits ought not to have been drawn since the circumstances do not admit the drawing of such a presumption in the case, According to Mr Chari, the presumption to be drawn ought to have been one under section 41 1 722 of Indian Penal Code or at the most tinder section 412 of the Indian Penal Code but not of complicity in the crime of dacoity It has been stated on more than one occasion that if the gap of time is, too large, the presumption that the accused was concerned with the crime itself gets weakened He contends that the circumstances under which the one presumption or the other may be drawn under section 114 of the have not been stated by law and therefore it is necessary always to start with the lesser presumption and draw the higher presumption only when there is some other evidence to show the complicity of the persons in the crime itself The houses of 20 persons were searched and large quantities of the stolen goods were found in their houses The facts are that two traders in cloth sent their wares in carts for sale Thereafter six carts left for Mudgal at about 10 pm
