The teaching in these medical colleges is undertaken by Professors and Associate Professors as well as by Specialists attached to the hospitals affiliated to the respective colleges It is urged that there is a distinction between the two posts of Radiologist and Associate Professor of Radiology as the post of Radiologist is a clinical post while that of Associate Professor of Radiology is a teaching post These posts should not be filled by hospital specialists or teaching specialists by promotion in the normal course The question is whether a Specialist Grade II in a teaching hospital belonging to the Central Health Service is eligible for appointment or promotion as a Professor or Associate Professor of the concerned speciality The aforesaid note is in consonance with the view that there is no inflexible rule that Specialists in a teaching hospital cannot be promoted as Associate Professor or Professors of their concerned speciality The post of Professor of Radiotherapy in the Maulana Azad Medical College is a post belonging to Specialist Grade I which is equivalent to Supertime Grade II carrying a pay scale of Rs The submission overlooks the distinction between a teaching and a non teaching hospital NON TEACHING POSTS Specialists ' Grade (now Specialist Grade II) All vacancies in this Grade (Rs Assistant/Associate Professors All vacancies in the posts of Assistant Professor and Associate Professor are filled by promotion through the Departmental Promotion Committee from amongst officers holding the posts of Lecturers and Assistant Professor respectively Normally, a Professor or an Additional Professor in a medical college or teaching institution can be appointed by direct recruitment from amongst persons holding the post of Associate Professor or Assistant Professor in the concerned speciality in a medical college or a teaching institution having at least six years ' teaching experience out of 12 years ' standing in the Grade through the Union Public Service Commission Such being the infra structure of the Central Health Service, the question is as to the promotional prospect of a Specialist Grade II in a teaching hospital to Specialists Grade I It is common ground that the appellant has the requisite essential qualifications for appointment as a Professor or an Associate Professor of Radiology An Associate Professor in the medical college or a teaching institution can only be promoted from amongst persons holding the post of Assistant Professor having at least five year 's teaching experience in the concerned speciality by the Departmental Promotion Committee It is also urged that the status of Associate Professor of Radiology (ex officio) which the appellant holds in the Irwin Hospital is akin to that of honorary Professor or Associate Professor in the Willing don Hospital or the Safdarjang Hospital and the mere designation of the appellant as Associate Professor of Radiology (ex officio) by the University of Delhi does not give him a right to hold the post of Professor of Radiology in Maulana Azad Medical College The officers promoted to the posts of Assistant Professor and Associate Professor are allowed a special pay of Rs 33 For promotion to the posts of Professor, Associate Professor/Assistant Professor with 8 years service are eligible 20000 which is admissible in the case of an Associate Professor There cannot be a medical college without a teaching hospital as its integral and inseparable part Mittal, Lecturer in Radiology in the Maulana Azad Medical College as Associate Professor of Radiotherapy ignoring the claim of the appellant The teaching posts (Professors) and hospital specialist ' posts (comprising other than administrative and teaching posts) at present included in Supertime Grade II should be placed in the revised scale of Rs These amendments have brought about a change inasmuch as there is now a vertical channel of promotion to the teaching posts upto the post of Associate Professor as a teacher in a teaching department It is necessary to emphasise that the recruitment rules nowhere provide that the teaching experience gained by a Specialist in a teaching hospital in the capacity of an Associate Professor (ex officio) shall not count towards the requisite teaching experience The contention that the position which the appellant enjoys as Radiologist cum Associate Professor of Radiology (ex officio) in the Irwin Hospital is similar to that of honorary Professor or Associate Professor in the Willingdon Hospital or the Safdarjang Hospital and the mere designation of the appellant as such does not give him a right to hold the post of Associate Professor of Radiology, cannot prevail This new grade may be called Specialists ' Grade I and the existing Specialists ' Grade may be called Specialists ' Grade II By parity of reasoning, it is urged that the designation of the appellant as a Radiologist cum Associate Professor of Radiology (ex officio) did not make him eligible for appointment to the post of Associate Professor of Radiotherapy in Maulana Azad Medical College There is a failure on the part of the Ministry of Health to draw a distinction between teaching and non teaching hospitals under the Central Health Service As the statutory rules do not provide that the teaching experience gained in an ex officio capacity shall not count towards the requisite teaching experience, the teaching experience gained by the appellant while holding the post of Radiologist cum Associate Professor of Radiology (ex officio) in the Irwin Hospital cannot be ignored in determining his eligibility for appointment as Professor or Radiology in Maulana Azad Medical College 2250 2500 All the vacancies in the posts of Principals of Medical College, Heads of teaching institution, Deans are filled by promotions of Professors Vacancies in the Specialist Grade I posts of Professor are filled by direct recruitment and promotion in the ratio of 1 : 1 The Health Ministry has also submitted a separate note regarding persons imparting teaching in various disciplines who are neither Professor, Associate Professor, Assistant Professor or Lecturer
