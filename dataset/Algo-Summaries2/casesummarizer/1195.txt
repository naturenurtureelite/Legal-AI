In both these documents the southern boundary is shown as the northern boundary of the leasehold land of Samanta The southern boundary of this leasehold is given as the northern boundary limit of the leasehold land of Girish Chandra Samanta and others and the western boundary is shown as the eastern boundary of Chatkari Jorh as per the map annexed This lease deed clearly shows that the southern boundary of this plot is conterminous with the northern boundary of the leasehold land in favour of Samanta As the plan is a part of the lease deed, it is clear from the plan that the northern boundary of the leasehold of Samanta is the said line In that lease deed the northern boundary is described to be the remaining portion of mauza Kujama and the western boundary is described as Chatkari Jorh It is common case that the southern boundary of the appellants ' leasehold is conterminous with the northern boundary of the respondents ' lease hold There, the northern boundary of the leasehold is described as the leasehold of Rajkumar Jugal Kishore Lal Singh Bahadur No plan was annexed to this lease deed The answer to this question depends upon the correct, delineation of the boundary line between the plaintiffs ' leasehold and the defendants ' leasehold The defendants denied that they had encroached upon the plaintiff , ' coal land and stated that the suit was barred by limitation The plan, exhibit 3(b), annexed to this lease deed shows the boundary line between the two leaseholds In this case the maps accepted by us are drawn to scale and the boundary is clearly demarcated One interesting feature is that a map has been referred to in each of the documents and the said map shows that the line drawn from point A to point B is the boundary between the two leaseholds But it does not prove that the respondents had knowledge of the fact that the appellant had encroached upon any portion of their coal mines On those allegations, they asked for the following reliefs: (a)That the intermediate boundary line between the plaintiffs ' coal land and the defendants ' coal land be ascertained and fixed The plaintiffs case was that as a result of a letter written by the Inspector of Mines on August 18, 1941, the plaintiffs made an inquiry and came to know that the defendants had encroached upon their coal mines on the northern side and removed coal from the encroached portion and had rendered the remaining coal of the encroached portion unworkable The first question that arises for consideration is whether the defendants had encroached Upon the plaintiffs ' coal land In the sub leases created by the appellant, maps were annexed and the boundary therein is in accord with that in exhibit 3(b) The plaintiffs and the defendant are adjoining colliery owners at Kujama But a perusal of exhibit I shows that there is no reference in regard to the western boundary to revenue records The said plan is drawn to scale and the boundary line is drawn between point A marked in the plan and point B marked therein
