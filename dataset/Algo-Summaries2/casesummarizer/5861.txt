The Bench Secretaries Grade 1 are in a higher pay scale than Bench Secretaries Grade II Of Scale Permanent Temporary Posts Scale Post Post Posts in higher scale 1 They were in the pay scale of Rs In this connection, I have also been directed to say that the nomenclature of posts of 10 Bench Secretaries appearing in column 5 of the said table shall be Bench Secretaries Grade I and the nomenclature of rest Bench Secretaries of equal pay scale will be Bench Secretaries Grade II and the posts of Bench Secretaries Grade I and Grade II will be of the same duties and responsibilities But they have been bifurcated into two grades with different pay scale The report did not accept the claim of Bench Secretaries for giving them pay scale equal to Section Officers or Private Secretaries When Bench Secretaries Grade II acquire experience and also display more merit, they are appointed as Bench Secretaries Grade I of Pay No The minimum pay scales of the Bench Secretaries is comparatively higher than the pay scale of Upper Division Assistants though they are appointed through a competitive examination Rule 16 provides that the posts of Bench Secretaries Grade I shall be filled up by promotion from amongst permanent Bench Secretaries Grade II The High Court directed that all Bench Secretaries irrespective of their grades should be given the pay scale admissible to Bench Secretaries Grade I with effect from October 1, 1975 They are selected among the lot of Bench Secretaries Grade II The reason given by the Pay Commission is as follows: "Bench Secretary 2638 Fifty two posts of Bench Secretaries are in the pay scale of Rs400 750 and ten posts in the scale of Rs500 1,000 Thereunder Bench Secretaries Grade I and Grade II were classified as Class II and Class III posts respectively The Government order by which the classification was done itself provided that duty and responsibility of Bench Secretary of Grade II be the same as of Grade I shall be seniority The pay scale of professors underwent revision It would be violative of principles of equal pay for equal work The work of the Bench Secretary is of a great importance the pay scale recommended by the Pay Rationalisation Committee, the nature of duties and responsibilities and the fact that every Hon 'ble Judge will have one Private Secretary in the scale of Rs500 1,000 we feel that the Bench Secretaries cannot be given the same scale of pay which is being given to Superintendents or the Section Officers ; and (ii) Whether the creation of two Grades with different pay scales in the cadre of Bench Secretaries who are doing the same or similar work is violative of the right to have "equal pay for equal work"? 160 320 as against the pay scale of Rs That is senior Bench Secretary although doing the same work as his junior became entitled to higher grade The entitlement to higher pay scale of Grade I Bench Secretary was therefore, not on the basis of seniority alone, but on the basis of selection by merit cum seniority Keeping in view the present scale of pay If Bench Secretaries of Group I would have been required to do any work different than Bench Secretaries Grade II, it could be described as promotional avenue The sheet anchor of their case was that in the same category of posts with similar duties and responsibilities there cannot be two grades with different pay scales The Bench Secretaries, therefore, cannot claim as of right the pay scale admissible to Section Officers The Committee recommended for them a pay scale slightly lower than that of Section Officers And that clearly violated the principle of equal pay for equal work
" `Equal pay for equal work for both men and women ' means equal pay for equal work for every one and as beween the sexes They challenged the validity of bifurcation of one cadre into Grade I and Grade II They have claimed that their duties are equivalent to Private Secretaries of Hon 'ble Judges and have demanded the same pay scale which is given to Private Secretaries and the Section Officers There is selection grade for District Judges To them the equality clauses will have some substance if equal work means equal pay" Subsequently, these pay scales were raised to Rs He challenged that discrimination in this Court as being violative of the right to have equal pay for equal work Since the Bench Secretaries are promoted from Upper Division Assistants, they should feel satisfied if they are placed in a scale of pay a little above the Upper Division Assistants Name Pay No The entitlement to higher pay scale depends upon selection based on merit cum seniority The higher qualifications for the higher grade, which may be either academic qualifications or experience based on length of service reasonably sustain the classification of the officers into two grades with different scales of pay The Bench Secretaries again moved the Government reiterating their demand Sd/ (Ramesh Chandra Deo Sharma) PG NO 295 Joint Secretary" It was then the turn of Bench Secretaries Grade II, They complained that there was no valid reason to give higher pay scale only to ten Bench Secretaries and step motherly treatment to the rest of their colleagues The entitlement to these higher pay scales depends upon seniority cum merit or merit cum seniority Under the rules framed by the Chief Justice of the High Court, Bench Secretaries Grade I are selected by a Selection Committee (2) It should be appropriate for the Bench Secre taries to accept 10 promotional posts in the pay scale of Rs500 1,000 as recommended by the Pay Commission
" It will be seen that the Pay Commission refused to equate Bench Secretaries with Section Officers in view of their differential duties That Pay Commission also did not disturb the categorisation of Bench Secretaries into Grade I and Grade IIIt however, gave marginal benefits by increasing the number of posts of Grade I from 10 per cent to 30 per cent of the total cadre strength The question is whether it is permissible to have two pay scales in the same cadre for persons having same duties and having same responsibilities
