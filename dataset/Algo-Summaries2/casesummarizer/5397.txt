A person can be in Class I or Class II service or post even when he hold a post of either class substantively or temporarily or on officiating basis On 371961, he was further promoted as officiating Executive Engineer in Class I service but on 491965, he was reverted to the post of Assistant Engineer in officiating position and was con tinuing in that post when he was compulsorily retired In the instant case, the petitioner was promoted as officiating Assistant Engineer which is a Class II post on 255 Instances are abundant where officers are promoted to Class I or Class II service or post of such class on officiating basis and such officiation lasts for a number of years There is no warrant for the conclusion that officiating Government servants in Class I or Class II service or post are outside the purview of sub clause (i) Similar is the position of an officiating hand He was pro moted as officiating Assistant Engineer in class II service with effect from ' 255 Officiating promotion certainly does not confer a right to the post and at any time the Government servant may be sent back to his substantive post In short, an officiating Govern ment servant does not really belong to Class I or Class II service until he acquires a right thereon There is no reference to officiating service in sub clause (i) Learned counsel for the petitioner does not dispute the position that a person who is in Class I or Class II service or post is in such service or post as covered by sub clause (i) The sole question that fell therein for decision before this Court was whether a Government servant officiating in Class I or Class II service or post could be retired compulsorily by exercising the power under Rule 56(j)(i) after he has attained the age of 50 years 56 (j)(i) has no application to officiating government servants, hence can have no appli cation to the petitioner since the petitioner was an officiating government servant
" bird who may have to go back to the substantive post from which he has been promoted on an officiating basis what is more to the point, a person who has been appointed de novo may begin his service on an officiating basis or on a tempo rary basis and it is obvious that he has no right to the post and cannot be strictly said to be in that service or post as a member of that service When a Government servant belonging to a Class I or Class II service or post on regular basis has to be retired compulsorily, Rule 56(j)(i) comes to the rescue of the Government 56 It has been argued before us that as the petitioner was holding an officiating appointment in Class 117 he could not have been compulsorily retired under sub clause (i) If the condi tion indicated in sub clause (i) is satisfied, namely, the Government servant is in Class I or Class II service or post and he had entered into service before attaining the age of 35 years, and has attained the age of fifty, the further condition that he must substantively belong to the two classes of service or post cannot be introduced into the scheme The relevant words used in sub clause (i) are "if he is in Class I or Class II service or post" in a substan tive capacity, and not on an officiating basis only
" The purpose of the sub clauses is to classify Gov ernment servants into two categories and sub clause (i) takes within its sweep those Government servants who at the relevant time are in Class I or Class II service or post, whether substantively, temporarily or on officiating basis Admittedly, he was holding a class II post when the impugned order was served on him Even viewed closely and meticulously, the structure of the clause, namely, "if he is in Class I or Class II 637 service or post", emphasises the nature of the service or post vis a vis the Government servant concerned The petitioner would have superannuated from service on 2921980 if he had not been compulsorily retired with effect from 639 511
