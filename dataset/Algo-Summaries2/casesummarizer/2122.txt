The Board To this Board the Government delegated its function under section 237 Strictly speaking the Chairman to whom the business of the Board is allocated does not become a delegate of the Board at all Constitution of Board of Company Law Administration The other provides for the procedure of the Board Amongst the matters allocated to the Chairman is the appointment of an Inspector under section 237 to investigate the affairs of a company One of the members of the Board has to be appointed a Chairman and this necessarily implies that the Board shall consist of at least two members (3) One of the members shall be appointed by the Central Government to be the chairman of the Company Law Board the persons concerned with the management of the affairs of the company have been guilty of fraud, misfeasance and other misconduct towards the company and its members By order dated February 6, 1964 the Chairman of the Company Law Board specified the cases and classes of cases to be considered jointly by the Board and distributed the remaining business between himself and other members of the Board Section 637 shows that the function under section 237 can be delegated to the Board and to no other authority He has also said that the Board was aware of the fact that the company had entered into collaboration with M/s Under the , a power of superintendence over the affairs of Companies is retained by the Central Government in much the same way as the Board of Trade in England exercise over Companies in that country The Government had, therefore, power to frame the Company Law Board (Procedure) Rules, 1964 authorising the Chairman to distribute the business of the Board The matter was enquired into by the Regional Director of the Board at Madras and he, in his report, sent to the Board in September 1964 suggested an urgent and comprehensive investigation into the affairs of the Company The order dated May 19, 1965 was passed by the Chairman of the Company Law Board Mr Setalvad submitted that only the Board could pass an order under section 237, the Central Government could delegate its function under section 237 to the Board but it had no power to authorise the Chairman to sub delegate this function to himself and consequently, the Company Law Board (Procedure) Rules, 1964 made by the Central Government on February 1, 1964 and the Chairman 's order of distribution of business dated February 6, 1964 delegating the function of the Board under section 237 to the Chairman are ultra vires the and the impugned order is invalid Mr Setalvad points out that the Company Law Board had decided in December 1964 to take action against appellant No of the company, the activities of the company and other related matters have been set out On this part of the case the appellant 's contention is that the Chairman of the Company Law Board Mr R C Dutt made the order for investigation into the affairs of appellant No The new sub section involves a delegation of the powers of the Central Government to a member of the Board which the Act previously allowed to be made to the Board only The power under section 237 was placed among the powers exercisable by the Chairman singly This Board is constituted under section 10E which has been introduced in the parent Act By section 237(b) the power is conferred on the Central Government but under the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1963 a Board of Company Law,, Administration consisting of a Chairman and a member has been set up The order was made by the Chairman of the Board, Mr R C Dutt on behalf of the Board by virtue of the powers conferred on him by certain rules to which we shall refer later 2 on account of the manner in which the affairs of the company were being conducted
" The report was next considered by two Under Secretaries arid by the Secretary of the Company Law board who all agreed "that there was need for a deeper probe into the affairs of the Company" T T Krishnamachari & Sons Under sections 10E(1) and 637(1)(a), the Central Government has power to constitute a Company, Law Board and to delegate its functions to the Board The issued capital of the Company was Rs In the context of section 10E, I am inclined to construe this rule making power liberally The Central Government has power to constitute the Company Law Board, to delegate its functions to the Board and to control (1) (2) 342 the Board in the exercise of its delegated functions In the exercise of the power conferred by this rule, the Chairman assigned the business under section 237 to himself The Chairman by an order dated February 6, 1964 specified the cases or classes of cases which are to be considered jointly by the Board and distributed the remaining business of the Board between the Chairman and the member each acting individually That is how action was taken in the name of the Board but by the Chairman and is the subject of challenge for the reason that a power delegated to the Board as a whole cannot be delegated to an individual member in the absence of a provision such as sub section
(4A) added recently to section 10E enabling the solidarity of the Board to be broken In view of the fact that the Central Government, by virtue of the powers conferred by sections 10 E and 637 delegated its powers under section 237 to them Company Law Board we shall read section 237 as if in place of the words "Central Government" there are the words "Company Law Board" or for brevity 'Board ' (5) The procedure of the Company Law Board shall be such as may be prescribed He acts in the name of the Board and is no more than its agent But even if he is looked upon as a delegate of the Board and, therefore, a sub delegate vis a vis the Central Government he would be as much subject to the control of the Central Government as the Board itself (4) No act done by the Company Law Board shall be called in question on the ground only of any defect in the constitution of, or the existence of any vacancy in, the Company Law Board 31 of 1965 has now inserted sub section
(4A) in section 10E authorising the Board to delegate its powers and functions to its Chairman or other members or principal officer There is no such affidavit and the reason is that the Chairman completely misunderstood his own powers (b) thereof confers, a discretion upon the Board to appoint an Inspector to investigate the affairs of a company Prima facie, all the members of the Board acting together were required to discharge this function and they could not delegate their duty to the Chairman On May 19, 1965 Mr D section Dang, Secretary of the Company Law Board issued an order on behalf of the Company Law Board made under section 237 (b) of the appointing 4 persons as Inspectors for investigating the affairs of the Barium Chemicals Ltd, appellant No In my opinion, the distribution of the business of the Board among its members is a delegation of its authority The contention is that the order of the Board appointing Inspectors is invalid But it was not solely on the basis of this memorandum that action was taken by the Board Coming to the third point of Mr Setalvad pointed out that four ex Directors of the Company who had resigned submitted a 327 memorandum to Mr T T Krishnamachari while he was holding the office of Finance Minister in which grave allegations were made concerning the affairs of the Company and the management of the Company by the second appellant By notification dated February 1, 1964 the Central Government has delegated, amongst other powers and functions, those conferred upon it by section 237 upon the Company Law Board As a matter of fact, the Government constituted a Board consisting of two members and appointed one of them as Chairman I think that these circumstances, without more, cannot reasonably suggest that the business of the company was being conducted to defraud the creditors, members and other persons or that the management was guilty of fraud towards the company and its members On May 30, 1964 and July 9, 1964 four of its directors submitted two memoranda alleging irregularities and even illegalities in the conduct of the company 's affairs to the Company Law Board Coming now to the affidavit of Mr Dang I find that he merely repeats what was stated in the affidavit of the Chairman Kali Chemie of Hannover arrived in India to negotiate a collaboration agreement with the company Turning to paragraph 16 of the affidavit we find that Mr Dutt has clearly reiterated that there was ample material before the Board on which it could and did form the opinion that there were circumstances suggesting that as stated in the order of May, 19, 1965, the business of the company was being conducted with intent to defraud creditors, members and other persons and further that the persons concerned in the management of the affairs of the company had in connection therewith been guilty of fraud, misfeasance and other misconduct towards the company and its members that some directors have resigned does not establish fraud or misconduct We are concerned really with the affidavits of the Chairman and Mr Dang in relation to the exercise of the power conferred by section 237(b) In other words, he has not disclosed anything from which it can be said that the inference which he has drawn that the Company was being conducted with intent to defraud its creditors, members and other persons or persons concerned in the management of the affairs of the Company were guilty of fraud, misfeasance and misconduct towards the company and its members was based on circumstances present before him (6) In the exercise of its powers and discharge of its functions, the Company Law Board shall be subject to the control of the Central Government It may be mentioned that in paragraph 16 of the affidavit the Chairman also stated: "With reference to paragraph 21 of the petition, I have already stated above that there was ample material before the Board on which it could and did form the opinion that there were circumstances suggesting that the business of the company was being conducted with intent to defraud its creditors, members and other persons and further that the persons concerned in the management of the affairs of the company had in connection therewith been guilty of fraud, misfeasance and other misconduct towards the company and its members
" quarters of the Board in New Delhi and both of them endorsed the recommendation of the Regional Director to order an investigation The writ petition is directed against 7 respondents, the first of which is the 318 Company Law Board On May 19 1965 the first respondent passed the impugned order which inter alia stated: "In the opinion of the Company Law Board there are circumstances suggesting that the business of M/s Barium Chemicals Ltd is being conducted with intent to defraud its creditors, members and other persons; and further that the persons concerned in the management of the affairs of the company have in connection therewith been guilty of fraud, misfeasance and other misconduct towards the company and its members We are, therefore, of the view that the order made by the Chairman on behalf of the Board is not invalid Sections 235 251 provide for investigation of the affairs of a company and for sundry matters related to such investigations I under section 237(b) and had actually obtained approval of Mr T T Krishnamachari to the proposed action Prima facie, the Board must act as a whole and cannot delegate its function to one of its members Section 235 deals with "Investigation of affairs of company on application by members or report by Registrar" One provides for distribution of work in such a way that each constituent part of the Board properly authorised, becomes the Board If a statute entrusts an administrative function involving the exercise of a discretion to a Board consisting of two or more persons it is to be presumed that each member of the Board should exercise his individual judgment on the matter and all, the members of the Board should act together and arrive at a joint decision These were admitted by Mr Dutt in paragraph 14 of the counter affidavit 2 did not agree to this with the result that the company 's negotiations with Kali Chemie broke down In this state of pleadings it would not be right to construe the affidavit of Mr Dutt to mean that the only conclusions emerging from the material before the Board are those that are set out in paragraph 14 of his affidavit We are concerned in this appeal with the legality of an order of the Chairman, Company Law Board, May 19, 1965, (purporting to be under section 237(b) of the ) declaring that the affairs of the Barium Chemicals Ltd be investigated It is clear from the counter affidavit of Mr Dutt and particularly from paragraph 5 thereof that the Board had before it not only two sets of memoranda dated May 30, 1964 and July 9, 1964 respectively from four ex Directors of the Company alleging serious irregularities and illegalities in the conduct of the affairs of the Company but also other materials Paragraph 20 onwards of the writ petition deals with the action taken by the Board and the various grounds on which according to the appellants the action of the Board is open to challenge The Board points out that over a long period beginning from September 1961 the Department had been receiving various complaints in regard to the conduct of the affairs of the Company T T Krishnamachari & Sons were and still are the sole agents in India for some of the products of Kali Chemie There is first mala fides attributed to the chairman because he is said to have acted under the behest of a Minister of Cabinet interested in another rival Company Apparently the four ex Directors were not holding 10% of the voting power of the Company This sub section enables the work of the Board to be distributed among members while sub section
(5) merely enables the procedure of the Board to be regulated It reads: "237 The matter was then considered by the Secretary of the Company Law Board in charge of investigation (Shri D section Dang, IAS) According to the second appellant, the four directors were disgruntled directors, hostile to him and the Company He contends that though the opinion of the Board is subjective the existence of circumstances set out in the sub cls The learned Attorney General submitted that a distribution of business among the members of the Company Law Board is not a delegation of its authority, and the maxim has no application in 341 such a case Let us now examine the affidavit of Mr Dutt In other words, the act of the Chairman was in the nature of, a fishing expedition and not after satisfaction that the affairs of the Company were being carried on even prima facie with the intent to defraud or that the persons incharge were guilty of fraud or other misconduct To sum up, then, our conclusions may be stated thus: The discretion conferred on the Central Government by section 237(b) to order an investigation and delegated by it to the Company Law Board is administrative, that it could be validly exercised by the Chairman of the Board by an order made in pursuance of a rule enacted by the Central Government under section 642(1) read with section 10E(5), that the exercise of the power does not violate any fundamental right of the company, that the opinion to be formed under section 237(b) is subjective and that if the grounds are disclosed by the Board the Court can examine them for considering whether they are relevant In this connection he has referred us to sub section
4A of section 10E which was subsequently added but not made retrospective by an amendment of the Act which confers an express power on the Central Government to enable the Chairman to distribute the powers and functions of the Board By May 11, 1965, the position therefore was that the collaboration agreement between the company and L A Mitchell Ltd was agreed to be continued and consequently the negotiations with the German company and M/s In September, 1964, a meeting was affanged in London between the company 's representatives and the representatives of LA Mitchell Ltd, of which Lord Poole was the Chairman Once it is conceded that the formation of an opinion by the Board is intended to be subjective and if the provision is constitutional which in our view it is the question would arise: what is that about which the Board is entitled to form an opinion? The last question is whether it was not competent to Mr Dutt alone to take the decision that an investigation be ordered against the company This power is of two kinds (a) calling for information or explanation from the Company and (b) ordering an investigation into the affairs of the Company by appointment of Inspectors for inspection, investigation and report No doubt the rival Company had tried to obtain the sole selling rights of, and even a share in, this Company T T K & Co The second is what are the powers of the Board in this behalf and whether they have been exercised contrary to the requirements of the Act The company is not a citizen and has no fundamental right under article 19 In the other part of the affidavit the Chairman has merely repeated section 237(b) but has not stated how he came to the conclusion and on what material The power under sub section
(4A) may be exercised by the Board independently of any rules framed by the Central Government Here Mr Dutt has stated that it was not competent to the Court to go into the question of adequacy or otherwise of the material on the basis of which orders under section 237(b) are passed by the Board , a suspicion having been entertained that all was not well with the company The matter was then placed before the Chairman who formed the opinion that there were circum stances suggesting the need for action under section 237(b) if, in the opinion of the Central Government, there are circumstances suggesting (i) that the business of the company is being conducted with intent to defraud its creditors, members or any other persons, or otherwise for a fraudulent or unlawful purpose, or in a manner oppressive of any of its members, or that the company was formed for any fraudulent or unlawful purpose; (ii) that persons concerned in the formation of the company or the management of its affairs have in connection therewith been guilty of fraud, misfeasance or other misconduct towards the company or towards any of its members; or (iii) that the members of the company have not been given all the information with respect to its affairs which they might reasonably expect, including information relating to the calculation of the commission payable to a managing or other director, the managing agent, the secretaries and treasurers, or the manager, of the company The firm of T T Krishnamachari & Sons approached appellant No We find, however, that the Central Government had under sections 10E(5) and 642(1) ample power to frame rules authorising the Chairman to distribute the business of the Board (1) As soon as may be after the commencement of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1963, the Central Government shall, by notification in the Official Gazette, constitute a Board to be called the Board of Company Law Admin istration to exercise and discharge such powers and functions conferred on the Central Government by or under this Act or any other law as may be delegated to it by that Government The second respondent is Mr T T Krishnamachari, who was at that time Minister for Finance in the Government of India The Board can consist of such number of persons not exceeding five as the Government thinks fit In other words the argument amounts to this that the provisions of section 237(b) have been utilised by the Board as a cloak for taking action under the provisions of section 235 The Company was registered in the year 1961 and had an authorised capital of Rs Clause (a) of sub section
(1) of section 637 read with section 10(E)(1) empower the Central Government to delegate its powers under section 237 to the Company Law Board In this paragraph Mr Dutt has admitted some of the facts stated in paragraphs 1 to 19 According to the learned Attorney General this provision was enacted only to make what was implicit in section 10E(5) read with section 642(1) clear and that the distribution of the work of the Board being merely a matter of procedure the order of the Chairman allocating the power under section 237(b) to himself did not amount to sub delegation of the power of the Board 1 at the instance of Mr T T Krishnamachari, the then Finance Minister and also because of his bias against appellant No If the facts do reasonably suggest any of these things to the Board, the power can be exercised,though another was the outcome of this memorandum and that by ordering it the Board has in effect enabled the ex Directors who continue to be shareholders to circumvent the provisions of sections 235 and 236 of the  T T K & Co Certain proposals were discussed and it was decided that the company should give notice to L A Mitchell Ltd canceling the agreement with them Therefore, according to him the real order is of Mr Krishnamachari even though the order is expressed in the name of the Board Similarly could not the fact that the company was continuously showing losses since its flotation and that 1/ 3rd of its 326 share : capital had ,been wiped out could have been suggestive of fraud to the Board But, on reading this affidavit as a whole and the affidavit of Mr Dang, I am satisfied that in paragraph 14 of his affidavit the Chairman has set out all the material circumstances which bad emerged on an examination of the various materials before him T T K Chemicals Private Limited L A Mitchell Ltd, liable to pay damages to the Company for the loss suffered by it One more point was urged in connection with this aspect of the argument and it is that the appellants were not given an opportunity to cross examine Mr T T Krishnamachari and Mr Dutt
