Daily hours In a 12 hour shift, the nine hours of work on any day can be spread over 12 hours and the extra hours will necessarily be hours of rest For the hours of rest he is not required to pay overtime but he must specify those hours The crew at the Alexandra Docks get a specified interval of one hour for rest and this makes up their 9 hours which is 8 hours ' work and one hour interval for rest They point out that in the former there is 3 hours ' overtime and in the latter there is 4 hours of overtime in the 12 hour shifts, but at the Prince 's and Victoria Docks there is 2 hours ' overtime only Thus the 12 hours ' shift at the Alexandra Docks was 8 hours ' of duty, 3 hours ' overtime and one hour variable recess Here too, the hours of work cannot be more than 9 in a day and taken with the intervals for rest these 9 hours may be spread over 10 1/2 hours He is not compelled to give overtime for the remaining four hours unless he takes work during those hours, provided he has specified those hours as intervals of rest At these docks 8 hours ' duty, 2 hours ' rest at variable times and 2 hours ' overtime were prescribed The Trustees, therefore, resolved that the shore crew at the Alexandra Docks should work for 8 hours and that there should be a variable recess of one hour and overtime of three hours should be paid If he takes work during the extra 4 hours or fails to specify the hours of rest he must pay overtime That number is 9 hours for any day and work up to 9 hours on any day can be taken without paying overtime if the total number of hours in the week does not exceed 48 Therefore, an employer can take actual work on any day upto 9 hours in a 12 hour shift, but he must pay a double rate for any hour or part of an hour of actual work in excess of 9 hours The Union claimed that a 12 hours ' shift should be divided into 8 hours ' work and 4 hours ' overtime as was the case with the Flotilla Crew As in the present case the total number of hours of work in a week is 48 (8 hours per day for 6 days) overtime is payable for that hour or part of an hour beyond the 8 hours in which the workman is either made to work or the interval is not specified When the two shift system began, each shift of 12 hours was broken up into 8 hours ' duty, 2 hours ' variable recess and 2 hours ' overtime Overtime A working day may extend to 12 hours but the number of hours of work cannot exceed 9 He can specify the intervals of rest and spread the 8 hours or 9 hours, as the case may be, together with intervals of rest over 12 hours in a twelvehour shift
