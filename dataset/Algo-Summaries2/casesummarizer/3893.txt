s 125 or has obtained a divorce from, her husband and has not remarried Divorce painfully implies that the husband orders her out of the conjugal home But what was the amount of mehar ? If any in statutory interpretation belongs to the ill used wife and the derelict divorcee Do divorcees have to 1) prove mutual consent to live apart? Moreover, the husband has not examined himself to prove that he has been giving allowances to the divorced wife Where the husband, by customary payment at the time of divorce, has adequately provided for the divorce, a subsequent series of recurrent does is 81 contra indicated and the husband liberated The Magistrate who tried the petition for maintenance held that the appellant was a subsisting wife and awarded monthly maintenance of Rs The compulsive conclusion from a divorce by a husband and his provision of a separate residence as evidenced by the consent decree fills the bill She proceeded on the footing that she was still a wife while the respondent rejected this status and asserted that she was a divorce and therefore ineligible for maintenance A suit relating to a flat in which the husband had housed the wife resulted in a consent decree which also settled the marital disputes 78 For some time there was flickering improvement in the relations between the quondum husband and the quondum wife and they lived together No settlement of claims which does not have the special statutory right of the divorcee under section 125 can operate to negate that claim Ill used wives and desparate divorcees shall not be driven to material and moral dereliction to seek sanctuary in the streets The purpose of the payment 'under any customary or personal law ' must be to obviate destitution of the divorcee and to provide her with wherewithal to maintain herself His case, on the contrary, is that she has forfeited her claim because of divorce and the consent decree His next plea was that there must be proof of neglect to maintain to attract s125 and his third contention was that there was a settlement by consent decree in 1962 whereby the mehar money had been paid and all claims adjusted, and so no claim for maintenance could survive 80 section 125 requires, as a sine qua non for its application, neglect by husband or father The only just construction of the section is that Parliament intended divorcees should not derive a double benefit The proposition, therefore, is that no husband can claim under section 127(3)(b) absolution from this obligation under section 125 towards a divorced wife except on proof of payment of a sum stipulated by customary or personal law whose quantum is more or less sufficient to do duty for maintenance allowance Payment of mehar money, as a customary discharge, is within the cognisance of that provision So the basic condition of neglect to maintain is satisfied On this foundation, he urged that accepting the contention of the respondent that the appellant was a divorcee? There must be a rational relation between the sum so paid and its potential as provision for maintenance We hold that every divorce otherwise eligible, is entitled to the benefit of maintenance allowance and the dissolution of the marriage makes no difference to this right under the current Code The keynote thought is adequacy of payment which will take reasonable care of her maintenance There was a reference to mehar money (Rs The payment of illusory amounts by way of customary or personal law requirement will be considered in the reduction of maintenance rate but cannot annihilate that rate unless it is a reasonable substitute The appellant, finding herself in financial straits and unable to maintain herself, moved the magistrate under section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, for a monthly allowance for the maintenance of herself and her child a simple reading of the sub section and it is curious how this innovative and sensitive provision with a benignant disposition towards destitute divorcees has been overlooked by all the courts below In this appeal, by special leave, we are called upon to interpret a benign provision enacted to ameliorate the economic condition of neglected wives and discarded divorcees, namely But if one were to locate a legal ground to raise The contention That the liability to pay maintenance had ceased on account of the payment of mehar, it is section 127(3) of the Code The next submission is that the absence of mutual consent to live separately must be made out if the hurdle of section 125(4) is to be over come He first argued that section 125(4) would apply in the absence of proof that the lady was not living separately by mutual consent This traumatic horror animates the amplitude of s127 This order was challenged before the sessions Judge by the aggrieved husband, who on a strange view of the law that the court, under section 125, had no jurisdication to consider whether the applicant was a wife, dismissed the petition in allowance of the appeal The Brief Facts The respondent (husband) married the appellant (wife) as a second wife, way back in 1956, and a few years later had a son by her The whole scheme of section 127(3) (b) is manifestly to recognise the substitute maintenance arrangement by lump sum payment organised by the custom of the community or the personal law of the parties Obviously, he has no case of non neglect
