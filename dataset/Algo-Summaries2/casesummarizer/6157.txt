Drums had been supplied by the buyers There the drums had been supplied by the buyer It would create an absurd situation if durable packing supplied by the assessee and returnable to the assessee is not to be included in the assessable value but a durable packing supplied by the buyer to the assessee and returnable to the buyer is made a part of the assessable value The Assistant Collector included the value of the drums in the assessable value of the said fusel oil/Styrene Monomer There was no evidence that there was any necessity of packing or putting them in drums prior to their sale The corrugated fibreboard containers could be re garded as secondary packing The appellant was not a manufacturer of drums Collector in those appeals had included the costs of such drums in the value of styrene monomer In the premises, the value of the drums with regard to the fusel oil/styrene monomer irrespective of whether these were supplied by the assessee or not, are not includible in the assessable value of the Styrene Monomer The question, there fore, that has to be examined in this case is whether these drums, containers or packing, by whatever name they are called, are necessary to make fusel oil or styrene monomer marketable as such or can these goods be sold without the containers or drums or packing? The fusel oil and monomer are supplied generally in tankers brought by the customers Sometimes it is supplied in drums provided by the customers who are not charged anything for those drums The value of the aforesaid drums should, therefore, be excluded from the assessable value for the purpose of excise duty 4339 of 1986 sold only 10% of the excisable goods to its buyer where drums were supplied by the buyers themselves and that 90% of the sales were through tankers belonging to the customers would not in any manner affect the question or determination of the assessable value of the excisable goods inasmuch as the 10% of its sales to whole sale buyers were in drums supplied by the buyers at the time of removal In the premises, the value of the drums irrespective of whether these where supplied by the assessee or not, is not inclu dible in the assessable value of the goods It is only that degree of secondary packing which is necessary for the assessable article to be placed in the condition in which it is sold in the wholesale market at the factory gate which can be in cluded in the assessable value of the article If they are generally sold in the wholesale market at the factory gate in a certain packed condition, whatever may be the reason for such packing, the cost of such packing would be includible in the value of the goods for assessment to excise duty The said sub section does not contemplate, accord ing to the appellant, the inclusion of the cost of packing in the value of goods when the packing is supplied by a customer to a manufacturer on its own cost It will indeed be anomalous if the cost of an item of pack ing charged for from the customer is to be excluded from the assessable value where the packing, though durable, is returnable to the manufacturer but the cost of an item of durable packing supplied by the customer and taken back by him is liable to be included in the assessable value It is only that degree of secondary packing which is necessary for assessable articles to be in the condition in which it is generally sold in the wholesale market which can be included at the factory gate which should be included in the value of the article However, if any special secondary packing is provided by the assessee at the in stance of a wholesale buyer which is not generally provided as a normal feature of the wholesale trade, the cost of such special packing would not be includible in the value of the goods The contention that the value of packing materials including those supplied by the buyer, has to be included in the value of the goods, is repugnant to the very scheme of section 4 vs Bombay Tyre International Ltd, (supra) dealing with the aspect of secondary packing, where this Court reiterated that the degree of secondary packing which is necessary for putting the excisable article in which it is sold in the wholesale market at the factory was the degree of packing where the cost would be included in the value of the goods for the purpose of excise duty According to the learned Attorney General, since the Act provides for only one exception to this measure, namely, non inclusion of the cost of such packing where the packing is durable in nature and is returnable by the buyer to the assessee, in all other cases the cost of the packing would have to be included in the assessable value of the excisable goods where such goods are delivered at the time of removal in packed condition Hence, there was no logic or reason for not excluding the value of packing material supplied by the buyer himself which is of durable nature and is return able by the assessee to the buyer The said drums were sup plied by the customers for the purpose of filling the fusel oil/Styrene Monomer Even secondary packing would be within the terms of the Explanation, because such second ary packing would also constitute a wrapper or a container in which the excisable goods are wrapped or contained The "cost of such packing" referred in section 4(4)(d)(i) does not in clude within its ambit the cost of packing not incurred by the manufacturer when the packing is supplied by the buyer and not the manufacturer It has also to be borne in mind that in any event in so far as Styrene Monomer Oil is concerned, the value of the drums in which it is packed is not includible in the assess able value of the goods The manufac ture of the goods was complete before these were placed in drums It is in relation to Section 4(4)(d) that it is contended that except the cost of packing which is of a durable nature and is returnable by the buyer to the asses see to the buyer, in respect of all other costs of packing, the costs should be included in the value of the 985 excisable goods The Tribunal was in error in holding that as at the time of removal, goods were delivered from the factory in packed condition and the containers were not returnable to by the buyer, the value of the drums is to be included If in order to be able to put it on the market, a certain amount of packing or user of containers or wrappers or putting them either in drums or containers, are required, then the value or the cost of such wrapper or container or drum must be included in the assess able value and if the price at which the goods are sold does not include that value then it must be so included by the very force of the terms of the Section The Tribunal held that at the time of removal the goods were delivered from the factory in packed condition and the containers were not returnable by the buyer, there fore, the value had to be included in the assessable value 4339 41/86, in respect of which show notice was issued as to why value of drums should not be included in the assessable value of fusel oil and Styrene Monomer, 90% of Styrene Mono 982 mer had been sold directly in tanks and only 10% of Styrene Monomer had been sold in drums and the show cause notice on 20th October, 1983 had been issued relating to clearance of fusel oil in 45 drums but the said drums had been supplied by the buyer Such a contention further overlooks the scheme of clause (i) where under durable packing returnable by the buyer has to be excluded But it has to be borne in mind that the duty of excise is chargeable with reference to the value of the excisable goods and the value is defined in express terms in that section The fusel oil/Styrene Monomer is also capable of being supplied in road tankers to customers It has to be borne in mind that the measure of excise duty is price and not value Similar ly, in my opinion, drums even though these were ancillary or incidental to the supply of fusel oil and styrene monomer, these were not necessary to complete the manufacture of fusel oil or styrene monomer; the cost of such drums cannot, therefore, be included in the assessable value thereof But the test to determine whether the cost of any particular kind of secondary packing is liable to be included in the value of the article is whether a particular kind of packing is done in order to put the goods in the condition in which they are generally sold in the wholesale 991 market at the factory gate 773 whereunder the appellant had cleared 24 KI of fusel oil in drums supplied by the buyer It was further urged that on a correct and true interpretation of Section 4(4)(d)(i) of the Act, the cost of packing could be included in the assessable value only when the packing is either manufactured by the assessee or is purchased by the assessee The Tribunal, therefore, it was urged, ought to have held that the value could not be included in the assessable value of the fusel oil/Styrene Monomer Learned Attorney General emphasised that the language of clause (d) of sub section (4) of section 4 of the Act made it clear beyond doubt that in cases where the Act provides for excise duty with reference to value of the excisable goods, while determining the value of such goods, the cost of packing where the excisable goods are delivered at the time of removal in packed condition, would have to be included in the assessable value of the excisable goods If this question is answered in the affirmative, then, in respect of the goods so sold, the cost of packing, whether incurred by the manufacturer or by the supplier, has to be automatically included in the assessable value if necessary, by addition to the sale price, except only where the packing is of durable nature and returnable to the manufacturer The goods were manufactured without these cylinders I agree that the cost of packing envisaged in section 4(4)(d)(i) of the Act for determining the "value" in rela tion to any excisable goods is only the "cost of such pack ing" incurred by the manufacturer and recovered from the buyer except where the packing is of a durable nature and is returnable by the buyer to the manufacturer 4339 of 1986 were delivered in tankers belonging to the assessee and only 10% of the goods were in packed condition at the time of removal clearly establish that the goods were marketable without being packed or contained in drums or containers The manufacture of the monomer was complete when it was stored in tanks
