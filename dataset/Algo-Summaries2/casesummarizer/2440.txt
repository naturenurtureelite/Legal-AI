necessary that the minimum wage the view that there were other industries in the region in which minimum wages were higher than the minimum wages paid by the Company, but failed to fix the minimum wages in the award in accordance with the minimum wages being paid in those industries These elements are basic wage, dearness allowance and production bonus that the bonus is worked out on the basis of the total wages paid It was also urged that, in fixing the minimum wage, the wages payable in the paper industry in other We have already quoted the figures of the minimum wage prevailing these concerns 671 Brajrajnagar, the minimum wage is above Rs The profit bonus that is paid is three months ' basic wage and does not take into account the dearness allowance and the production bonus elements of the total wage 73 pm as the wage covering the basic wage and the dearness allowance, in addition to Rs The only 'other point argued before us in respect of wages by learned counsel was that casual workers should also be paid minimum wages on the same basis as the permanent workers for whom the minimum wage was fixed by the Tribunal which is being varied by us by increasing it to a total wage packet of Rs In such cases, the calculation is still on the basis of basic wage, because it cannot be assumed that their wage is a consolidated wage consisting of the two 678 elements of basic wage and dearness allowance lumped together 41 as basic wage, Rs The Tribunal, in its award, held that the minimum wage in so far as it consists of basic wage and dearness allowance,, should be fixed at Rs In the majority of the industries, which are being compared with the Company in the region, consequently, the minimum wage is the total wage packet receivable by the workman and there is no extra amount received as production bonus when applying the principle of fixing the minimum wage primarily on the basis of comparison The Tribunal considered the minimum wages in these concerns on the basis of the prevailing Price Index of 441 a ' Sambalpur taking 100 as the basic Price Index for the year 1939 Even when fixing the minimum wage ,for the Company on the basis of the alternative calculation made by the Tribunal, the Tribunal has proceeded on the assumption that the minimum wage is being fixed for the Price Index No Thus, the total minimum wage packet which a workman should be entitled to receive was fixed by the Tribunal at Rs The first matter related to fixation of wages, including minimum wages, and this was covered by items Nos As a result, it would have to be held that the total minimum wage of Rs 95 consisting of ' the three elements of basic wage; dearness allowance and production bonus In the present case, the Tribunal chose the course of leaving it to the workmen to ask for increase in minimum wage on any further rise in Price Index and did not consider it advisable to link the wages with it 95 per mensum which is about the average of the wages prevailing in all those concerns payable as production bonus On their basis, it appears to us that there will be full justification for fixing the minimum wage in the Company at Rs The Tribunal mentioned that, according to the Coal Award, the minimum wage in the Collieries at the then existing Price Index was Rs area, the other concerns are paying much lower wages Comparing with them, there is justification for fixing the total wage packet of the workmen in the Company 'at Rs 13 as production bonus The workmen in their written statement had relied on the wage structure in these concerns obviously on the basis that they were comparable (x) The Company is paying profit bonus equivalent to three months ' basic wage of each workman Consequently, in varying the award of the Tribunal we would direct that the 'total minimum wage packet of a workman in the Company shall be fixed ,at Rs In fact, the Tribunal also accepted them as being comparable 'and that is why, in its conclusion, the Tribunal held that, in its opinion, it would be appropriate under the circumstances of the case to fix the minimum wage in the Company on the basis of the minimum wage prevailing in other industries in that region The pleading makes it clear that the claim for six months ' wages was not based on the Full Bench Formula, but on the ground that certain clerical staff was being paid bonus which, in effect, amounted to about six months ' basic wages, because the bonus was calculated ;in their case by taking into account the consolidated wages, including dearness allowance, while in the case of the workmen, the dearness allowance element of the wages was being ignored and bonus was calculated only by taking into account basic wages Instead, what the Tribunal did was to work out the minimum wages, which should be paid, on an entirely different basis are beingcompared with the Company for the purpose of fixation of the minimum wage Consequently, we do not think that there is any justification for departing from the figure of Rs95 which is the average minimum wage payable by those industries (1) [1963] Supp Finally, it was argued that other amenities being provided by the Company should also be taken into account when fixing the minimum wage On these facts, the Tribunal held that it would not be proper to compare the wage structure for these Paper Mills with that of the Company The break up of this wage into the three 'elements is of some importance in this case because of the principle on which the 674 profit bonus is paid by tiffs Company On the basis of this finding of fact, the Tribunal held that, if the minimum wage in the Company is to be fixed more on the basis of the minimum wage prevailing in other industries in that region which, in its opinion, would be appropriate under the circumstances of the case, then, a revision was really necessary As a result, the appeal is only partly allowed inasmuch as the minimum wage fixed by the Tribunal in the Award is carried as indicated by us above The claim was, in fact, based on the circumstances that, according to the workmen, the bonus in their case was being calculated as equivalent to three months ' basic wages, while, the case of some clerical staff, the calculation was made on the basis of their consolidated wages consisting of basic wages and dearness allowance Having come to this view, it is clear that, to give full effect to the principle laid down by this Court the case of French Motor Car Co
