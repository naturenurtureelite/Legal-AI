They are either local sales or inter State sales or export sales A sale of goods made to an export canalising agency such as the State Trading Corporation or to an export house to enable such agency or export house to export those goods in compliance with an existing contract or order is inextricably connected with the export of the goods When is a sale or purchase of goods said to take place in the course of import or export (1) A sale or purchase of goods shah be deemed to take place in the course of the export of the goods out of the territory of India only if the sale or purchase either occasions such export or is effected by a transfer of documents of title to the goods after the goods have crossed the customs frontiers of India
" We are unable to conceive of a fourth category of sale, which could be neither a local sale nor an inter State sale nor an export sale It would be a local sale or inter State sale If the purchaser dealer of the manufactured goods is in some other State and the goods have been moved out of Haryana in pursuance of that sale, they would be inter State sales It said: "According to section 5(1) of the , a sale or purchase of goods can qualify as a sale in the course of export of the goods out of the territory of India only if the sale or purchase has occasioned such export or is by a transfer of documents of title to the goods after gods have crossed the customs frontiers of India The apppellant claimed its sales to be "sales in the course of export" and hence exempt under section 5 of the CST The, definition also excludes from its purview "the sale proceeds of goods on which purchase tax is leviable under this Act" and "the purchase value of any goods on the sales of which tax is leviable under this Act" Fur ther, if such sales do not qualify as sales in the course of export, they would be liable to State sales tax and there would be a corresponding increase in the price of the goods There is no dispute that the assessees have transferred the manufactured goods by way of sale and that these goods have been despatched to various ports of India The definition of 'turnover ' clearly postulates that goods are either to be taxed at the point of purchase or sale and the same transaction cannot be taxed as a sale in the hands of the dealer who sells to the assessees and as a purchase in the hands of the assessees 136 that the sale by an Indian exporter from India to a foreign importer alone qualifies 'as a sale which has occasioned the export of the goods Each of the assessee have sold its goods to another dealer, If that dealer is also a resident of Haryana and has taken delivery of the goods in Haryana and exported them thereafter, the assessees ' sales would be local sales He then sold the manufactured goods to dealers who, in turn, exported those goods out of India 364 (1) that there will be a tax on the purchase of the raw materials if the manufactured goods are disposed of in the State itself otherwise than by way of sale; and (2) that there will be no tax on the purchase of the raw materials if the manufactured goods are despatched from the State consequent on a (i) local sale; (ii) inter State sale; or (iii) a sale in the course of export Explanation 2 to the second defini tion provided: "(2) The proceeds of the sale of any goods on the purchase of which tax is leviable under this Act or the purchase value of any goods on the sales of which tax is leviable under this Act, shall not be included in the turnover, but the purchase value of the goods liable to tax under section 9 shall be included
" The only third possi bility is that assessee sold the goods to a dealer outside India and exported the goods in pursuance of that sale in which event it would be a sale within the meaning of section 5(1) of the  The goods which have been sold by the assessee must have been delivered to the dealer in pursuance of the sale either within the State or outside the State in India Even in such a case if the transport of goods from the assessee 's place of business to the port is in pursuance of the terms of the sale, the movement of the goods would be occasioned by the sale made by the assessee and would be an inter State sale There can be no dispute that a tax is leviable under the Act on the goods in question when they are sold by a dealer and, indeed, the assessees would have had to pay tax on the sales made to the purchases effected by them but for a claim for exemption under section 24 It is, therefore, proposed to amend, with effect from the beginning of the current financial year, section 5 of the to provide that the last sale or purchase of any goods preceding the sale or purchase occasioning export of those goods out of the terri tory of India shall also be deemed to be in the course of such export if such last sale or purchase took place after and was for the purpose of complying with the agreement or order for, or in relation to, such export" The raw materials purchased by the assessees are goods on the sales of which tax is leviable under the Act though the assessees are 366 exempt from payment of such tax by reason of section 24(1) If due regard be given to these words, he pointed out, the assessees would be entitled to an exemption from the impugned purchase tax only if their sales 360 were export sales within the meaning of section 5(1) of the CST 141976, reads thus: "(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub section (1), the last sale or purchase of any goods preceding the sale or purchase occasioning the export of those goods out of the territory of India shall also be deemed to be in the course of such export, if such last sale or purchase ' took place after, and was for the purpose of complying with, the ' agreement or order for or in relation to such export" Sirajuddin 's case (supra), although the exemption claimed for the sales as export sales was denied, the conclusion of the High Court that the sales to STC
