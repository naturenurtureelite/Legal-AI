from the land allotted to them to the Zoo and the other to the Taj Group of Hotels for the construction of Five Star Hotels Group and the Begumbari property to the Taj Group of Hotels had disapproved the taking away of the land from the Zoo and leasing it to the Taj Group of Hotels The Calcutta Zoo has the smallest area in comparison to other reputed Zoo Its action was not against the interests of the Zoological Garden or not in the best interests of the animal inmates of the zoo or migrant birds visiting the zoo Only Taj Group of Hotels came forward with an offer to start the hotel They were clearly not doing so at the behest of the Taj Group of Hotels The Managing Com mittee of the Zoo also initially expressed its opposition to the proposal to construction hotel on land belonging to the Zoo The main zoo is in the fortynine acres block of land and the Taj Group of Hotels had come forward with any proposal and the Taj Group of Hotels instead of inviting tenders did not fructify while negotiations with the Taj Group of Hotels fruitioned It is out of these eight acres that the land of the extent of four acres has been carved out and given to the Taj Group of Hotels for the construction of a Five Star Hotel and the Taj Group of Hotels in regard to leasing the Hastings House property and the Begumbari land To serve this purpose they want to prevent a 5 Star Hotel coming up in its vicinity in_four acres land belonging to the Zoo and thus to see that this land is not lost to the Zoo 245 would have to be shifted to the main Gardens resulting in unhealthy atmosphere for the zoo animals and also hampering the beauty of the zoo Gardens We have it in the record that the Oberoi Group of Hotels already had a Five Star Hotel in Calcutta while the Welcome Group of Hotels were making their own Private negotiations and arrangements for establishing a Five Star Hotel and the Taj Group respectively While so, the Managing Committee of the Zoo, on June 11, 1981, passed a resolution expressing itself against the proposal to construct a hotel on land belonging to the Zoo We have no doubt that the Government was quite alive to the need for expan sion of the zoo when they decided to grant four acres of Begumbari land which was not used for the main purpose of the zoo for the construction of a Five Star hotel A reference was made to the Committee of Secretaries who negotiated with the Taj Group of Hotels The approach of the Taj Group Hotels in this case has been creditably fair The Chief Minister was certainly aware of the question of the migratory birds before it was finally decided to allot the Begumbari land to the Taj Group of Hotels On the same day the Taj Group of Hotels wrote to the Government of West Bengal stating that the proposed land could be seriously considerd for construction of a Hotel The Begumbari land was given to the Zoological Garden by the Government in 1880 This was not to the disadvantage, but to the advantage of the Zoo and its inmates These essential services cannot be accommodat ed within the campus of the main zoo for risk of spreading of infection to other animals of the zoo The Committee resolved that construction of a multistories buildings in the near vicinity of the zoo will be highly detrimental to the animals of the Zoo, its ecological balance and adversely affect the bird migration which is one of the greatest attractions of the zoo The Committee is of a opinion that no portion of Zoo land can be parted with for any other 247 purpose This eight acre plot of land is known as the Begumbari land 30 lakhs has now been spent by Taj Group of Hotels in connection with the reconstruction It was suggested that the Government may consider abandoning the proposal to set up a hotel on the Eastern side of the Zoo It was also said that if the hospital and the burial ground were to be shifted to the main garden it would result in an unhealthy atmosphere for the animals and the zoo and would detract from the beauty of the Zoo Garden The Minister for Metropolitan Development submitted a note to the Chief Minister on the resolution of the Managing Committee of the Zoo On September 28, 1981 the Government of West Bengal officially conveyed its acceptance of the proposal of the Taj Group of Hotels for the construction of a Five Star Hotel The Resolution said, "The proposal for soil testing of zoo land in the Begumbari Compound for the purpose of construction of Five Star Hotel was discussed in the meeting The land allotted to the hotel was, as we have seen, not used for the main purpose of the 260 zoo and was not in fact part of the main Zoological Garden We may add here that the Taj Group of Hotels have spent a sum of Rs In taking a decision to take away the land from the Zoo and to lease the same to the Taj Group of Hotels, relevant considerations had been ignored and irrelevant considerations had been taken into account This being the position soil testing will hardly be of any avail as the zoo cannot spare the land They have given all the assurances necessary to preserve the Zoo and its inmates and agreed to the proposal on the assurance that adjacent land and matching grants would be given to the Zoo Taj Group suggested further modifications Such as those as were really interested in the matter like the Managing Committee of the Zoological Garden and the Director of the Zoo did have their say in the matter We find it difficult to treat this decision to negotiate with the Taj Group in regard to construction of a Five Star Hotel on the Begumbari land as a final decision to part with the land This preliminary objection of the Hotel Group was rejected We do not think that the provisions of the Bengal Public Parks Act have any relevance to the question of the power of the Government to transfer the Begumbari land to the Taj Group of Hotels The zoo proper is about 40 acres on the Western side, while the eastern part comprises the Zoo Hospital, audiovisual centre acquari um, Zoo store and Staff quarters Indira Gandhi 254 wrote to Mr Tata expressing her happiness that the Hotel was not going to upset the Zoo animals and welcoming his offer to help the State Government to improve the Zoo 's facilities If further facilities are necessary for the Zoo, the Government will provide them" The Government was anxious that more Five Star Hotels should be established at Calcutta and the Taj Group was willing to establish one The inspection was made in the presence of the Direc tor of the zoo Procurement of green fodder for the large number of harvivorous animals of the zoo is already a serious problem for the zoo and any disturbance to fodder cultivation will aggravate the situation In the face of all this material, we do not see how it can be seriously contended that the interests and the requirements of the Zoo were totally ignored and not kept in mind when the decision was taken to lease the land to the Taj Group of Hotels On June 29, 1981, the Director of the Zoo wrote to the Secretary of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services Department stating his objections to the Proposal to lease the land for construction of a hotel The letter of the Director of the Zoo was followed by a note by the Secretary of the Animal Husbandry Department suggesting that the practical problems of the Zoo should receive de tailed consideration and that the immediate transfer of the land to the hotel would mean discontinuance of the existing facilities It forms part of an area belonging to the State Government which the Zoo authorities have upto now been allowed to use to look after sick animals of the Zoo and as labour quarters It was stated that though the Forest Department had suggest ed that Salt Lake was a better place for establishing a Five Star Hotel, there was no demand for a Five Star Hotel in that area and the request for a hotel in Salt Lake was confined to a Three Star Hotel The Government had already in mind a proposal to start a subsidiary Zoo in an extent of about 200 acres of land in the outskirts of Calcutta This public interest:litigation takes its birth, perhaps from the righteous indignation of the petitioners, against the State Government at their bartering away of four acres of land belonging to the Zoo to the Taj Group of Hotels A modern zoo hospital for animals has been constructed in the remaining extent of Begumbari land replacing the old hospital which was housed in a semi dilapidated building On a consideration of all the facts and circumstances of the case, we are satisfied that the Government of West Bengal acted perfectly bona fide in granting the lease of Begumbari land to the Taj Group of Hotels for the construc tion of a Five Star hotel in Calcutta The Chief Town Planner who was deputed to visit the site at the request of the Secretary, Metropolitan Development Department and who visited the Zoo accompanied by the Director of the Zoo reported that 2 to 21/2 acres of land might be made avail able for the hotel So the practical problems of the Zoo did not receive detailed consideration earlier and the Begumbari property may be offered to the Taj Group and that at a later stage a suitable Committee might be appointed to negotiate with the two groups of hotels The Chief Minister further drew the attention of the Prime Minister to the fact that the hotel was likely to be a six storeyed one and would not be the only tail building near the Zoo Much of the argument on this question was based on the assumption that the decision to lease the Begumbari land to the Taj Group of Hotels was taken on February 12, 1981 It is to be mentioned here that even by February 21, 1981 the proposal to lease out the Begumbari land to the Taj Group of Hotels had become public knowledge and newspapers carried reports on the same On September 10, 1981 the Cabinet took the final decision to grant a ninety nine years lease of the Four acres of Begumbari land to the Taj Group of Hotels The substance of the objection of the Public Undertakings Committee was that the facilities available in the Begumbari land would be left unprovided for if the land was given to the proposed hotel was interested in a property known as the Hastings House Property and that the Taj Group of Hotels who considered the Hastings House property unsuitable may be offered four acres out of the eight acres of Begumbari land The proposal to lease the Begumbari land was public knowledge as we have seen It was suggested that the Zoo itself required to be expended and there was, therefore, no land which could be spared It was on September 10, 1981 that the Cabinet finally took the decision to lease the Begumbari land to the Taj Group 5 to enable them to construct a 5 star hotel in Calcutta The subject which was discussed by the Expert Committee on September 25, 1981 was "Construction of a Five Star Hotel within the premises of Alipore Zoo in Calcutta" The next question is whether the Government was alive to the ecological considerations, particularly to the question of the migratory birds when they took the decision of lease the land to the Taj Group of Hotels There are some old buildings and vacant land in the eight acre plot of land Since the Hastings House property, was not found acceptable by the Taj Group, it was decided to negotiate with them in regard to construc tion of a Five Star Hotel on the Begumbari land It is to be noted here that though the stipulation was that the cost of new construction was to be initially met by Taj Group of Hotels and later to be adjusted against the rent payable by Taj Group, the Taj Group later agreed to waive such reimbursement hospital and operation theatre are reconstructed on the adjacent land occupied by the Zoological Garden We have already explained why the choice of the Taj Group of Hotels must be held to be beyond suspicion and above reproach Subsequent to the filing of the Writ Petition, a lease deed was executed by the Taj Group of Hotels in favour of the Government Presumably as a consequence of the letter from the Director of the Zoo there was a note by the Secretary, Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services Department suggest ing the postponement of the implementation of the Cabinet decision till the necessary facilities then available at Begumbari land were shifted to other land of the same extent within a reasonable distance from the Zoological Garden, as 249 these facilities were originally linked with the Zoo and to the Taj Group and for the constitution of a suitable Committee to undertake negotiations with the two groups He added that the Managing Committee 's resolution was not binding on the Government and suggested that the Director of the Zoo might be asked to allow the Taj Group to undertake soil testing etc There were already a large number of high rise residential buildings around the Zoo The concern of the appellants has been to preserve the Zoo, to protect and encourage the migratory birds, to keep their trajectory clear, to preserve their diurnal feed and nocturnal habitat and to protect the Zoo We find it impossible to agree with the stricture that the Chief Minister turned a blind eye and a dent ear to the interests and the requirements of the Zoo and went about the question 259 of allotment of land to the Taj Group of Hotels determined to give the land to them and with a mind closed to every thing else The area proposed to be taken for Hotel construction is already used by the zoo for fodder cultivation, burial ground for dead animals, animal hospital, operation theater, quarantine area, segrega tion wards, postmortem room and nursery both for zoo animals and horticultural section He pointed out that even if four acres out of the eight acres of Begumbari land was given to the Taj Group, there would still remain sufficient land for accommodation of the facilities So that they will respect the land We have earlier referred to the letter of the Director of the Zoo dated June 29, 1981 addressed to the Secretary, Animal Husbandary Department where he expressed his opposi tion to the proposal on the ground that the Zoo could not be run for a single day without the essential services which were being provided in the four acres of land proposed to be given for the hotel He stated, 248 "It appears that a total of four acres of Begumbari land is proposed to be taken for hotel construction Meanwhile negotiations with Taj Group proceeded apace On January 15, 1982, the Government of West Bengal wrote to the Land Acqui sition Officer, with 250 copies to the Taj Group of Hotels, directing the Land Acqui sition Officer to give possession of the land to the Taj Group of Hotels subject to their later executing a proper long term lease It would be stretching credibility to suggest that it is necessary to grow fodder in the Begum bari land to feed the elephants in the zoo The Manag ing Committee of the Zoo which had initially opposed the proposal had also come round and had agreed to the proposal Bearing in mind the proper approach that we have to make when 263 questions of ecology and environment are raised, an approach which we have mentioned at the outset, we are satisfied that the facts and circumstances brought out by the appellants do not justify an inference that the construction of the pro posed hotel in the Begumbari land would interfere in any manner with the animals in the Zoo and the birds arriving at the Zoo or otherwise disturb the ecology: The proposed hotel is a Garden hotel and there is perhaps every chance of the ecology and environment improving as a result of planting numerous trees all around the proposed hotel and the removal of the burial ground and dumping ground for rubbish The Zoological Garden, Alipore was one such park The Chief Minis ter also mentioned that there appeared to be some misconcep tion that the plot in question was a part of the Zoo Garden He further mentioned that the grounds of the Zoo between the lake and the Belve dere Road were covered with tall trees and that the birds negotiating the trees would have to fly at the steeper angle than it would be necessary to negotiate the proposed hotel This calculation conveniently forgets that what is involved here is not the sale of the land but a lease by the Government, as a policy decision to the hotel group to start a Five Star Hotel, which according to the Government was a prime need to the city of Calcutta The learned counsel for the appellants urged that the second Cabinet Memorandum dated September 9, 1981 on which date the Government took the final decision to grant the lease made no mention of the needs and interests of the Zoo or the facilities provided in the Begumbari land for the Zoo On January 7, 1981 a memorandum was prepared for the consideration of the Cabinet explaining the need for more Five Star Hotels in Calcutta and the benefits flowing out of the construction and establishment of such Five Star hotels "* * * * * * Originally this zoo was on the outskirts of the City but the City has grown in such a fashion that the zoo has vertually become the City Centre and there is hardly any scope for its expansion We cannot do so in the face of the assurance of the Chief Minister that facilities would be provided for the Zoo and if, as the saying goes, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, the Chief Minister 's assurances are found reflected in the lease executed by the Taj Group of Hotels in favour of the Government of West Bengal Tata, on behalf of the Taj Group of Hotels, also wrote to the Prime Minister assuring her that the hotel management had dis cussed the matter at length with a representatives of the Wild 261 Life Fund who, after discussion, had been satisfied that the proposed hotel would cause no disturbance to the birds "Regarding the fear that lights emanating from the hotel or illuminate of signs of the hotel would disorient the birds and possibly cause them to hit the building the Management of the Hotel Company has taken a firm decision that there will be no bright lights or noon signs emanating from the hotel" The Chief Town Planner thought that two to 21/2 acres of land only might be made available for the hotel In May, 1980 the Taj Group of Hotels came forward with a suggestion that they would be able to construct a Five Star Hotel if any of three properties on Chowringhee, specified by them, was made available to them The land could not be leased to the Taj Group of Hotels without inviting tenders from willing per sons and without complying with the requirements of para graphs 166 and 167 of the Land Manual "As regards the objection that arise from the hotel itself from vehicular traffic to and from the hotel would disturb the birds, the hotel will be totally airconditioned so that no noise will emanate from it, while noise from the heavy traffic on Belvedere Road does not seem to have bothered the birds upto now It was also pointed out that particular care would be taken in the matter of illumination of the hotel so that bright lights or neor signs emanating from the hotel would not disturb the birds and animals They also agreed to have subdued light in ' the hotel, again in the interest of the birds They were Shri Pushp Kumar, Director of the Hyderabad Zoo and Mrs Anne Wright Tata wrote to the Prime Minister pointing out that their Hotel management had discussed the matter at length with represen tatives of the Wild Life fund who were satisfied that the proposed hotel would cause no disturbance to the birds The objections of the Managing Committee were first brought to the notice of the Minister for Metropolitan Development who submitted a note to the Chief Minister pointing out that even if four acres of land out of the eight acres of Begumbari land was given to the Taj Group, there would still remain sufficient land for accommodating the existing facilities On March 19, the Taj Group submitted a proposal to the Government containing fairly detailed information about the tourism industry and its needs, the situation in Calcutta, the realities of hotel construction, the facts relating to what had been done in other cities, the benefits flowing out of the construction of hotels and their own proposals for constructing a hotel in the four acres of land in Belyedere Road In fact, as the grounds of the zoo between the lake and Belvedre Road are covered with high trees, the climbing or descent angle which the birds have to negoti ate to get over the trees is already steeper that it will be between the lake and the proposed hotel The construction of a Five Star Hotel was too heavy a cost to pay for the environmental detriment caused by it She queried whether the Hotel could not be located elsewhere The Chief Minister assured the Prime Minister that the existing structures would be relocated on the adjacent land and until that was done the Zoo would continue to get their services and facil ities from the existing structures It is this giving away of land, that was challenged before the High Court and is now challenged in this Court in this appeal by two citizens of Calcutta, one of them the Secretary of the Union of workmen of the zoological garden and the other a life 243 member of the zoo, both of whom claiming to be lovers of wild life and well wishers of the zoo The Chief Minister 's attention was expressly drawn to the Managing Committee 's first Resolution expressing its opposition to the proposal to give the land for the construction of a hotel and detailing the objections and the Chief Minister had expressly noted that all facili ties necessary for the Zoo would be provided by the Govern ment Several authorities and insti tutions like the Director of the Zoo, the Managing Committee of the Zoo, the Public Undertakings Committee of West Ben gal, the Indian Wild Life Board, leading ornithologists of the country, etc For this land is sacred to us On January 7, 1982, there was a joint meeting of the Establishment and Finance sub committees of the Zoo and it was decided to recommend to the Committee of management that the demarcated area of four acres may be relinquished in favour of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services Department subject to the requirement that the Zoo will continue to get the services and facilities in the existing structures until they were reconstructed on the adjacent land It would be impossible, according to the Committee to accommodate these essential services within the campus of the main Zoo The Committee also referred to a proposal to establish a 'Subsidiary Zoo ' some slight distance from Calcutta City and the request said to have been made for the allotment of 200 acres of land for that purpose He expressed the apprehension that if four acres of land were to be given for construction of a hotel, then the entire hospital and the dumping ground would have to be removed and the southern boundary of the hotel would come very close to the residential block The Chief Minis ter considered the objections and noted that if further facilities were necessary for the Zoo, Government would provide them It is immaterial whether the move come first from the Government or from the Taj Group He gave his reasons as follows: "The four acre plot assigned to the Hotel Company by the State Government is not within the boundaries of the area belonging to the Zoological Gardens but on the other side of Belvedere Road, an important thoroughfare parallel to the main boundary of the zoo and some 700 feet from the main part of the lake Did the Act deal with the land at all? On August 21, 1982 the Chief Minister sent his reply pointing out that the 252 four acres of land were agreed to be relinquished by the Committee of management of the Zoological Garden on condi tion that alternate arrangements were made for shifting the existing structures which were necessary for the Zoo from the plot in question to the adjacent plot It could only be done by negotiation between the persons coming forward with proposals to estab lish Five Star Hotels In June 25, 1981, the Managing Committee of the Zoo met again and passed another Resolution by which they withdrew their earlier objections If the proposed hotel is set up, all the existing buildings, viz Another term was that the Zoological Garden Committee would be suitably compensated for any expenditure incurred by it on the construction of any building on the land We are unable to agree with the submission of Dr Singhvi, learned counsel for the appellants, that the Gov ernment of West Bengal decided to grant the lease of the Begumbari land to the Taj Group of Hotels without applying their mind to very important relevant considerations He explained that what he meant to say was that migratory birds visiting the Zoo lake choose places to the east and south east of the lake for nocturnal feeding and that their flight to the nocturnal feeding grounds in the marshes would be affected, if the proposed hotel was a high rise building Another multistoreyed building which was going to be the largest in the locality was under construction near the Zoo for the Post and Telegraph Depart ment The Govern ment found that there was some litigation connected with the Chowringhee properties and, therefore, it would not be possible to convey the Chowringhee properties to the Taj Group of Hotels (i) burial ground for dead animals, a number of which die of infectious and commu nicable diseases, (2) quarantine area for keeping animals coming to the Zoo, at least for 15 days before being shifted to the Zoo proper, (3) isolation wards away from Zoo Hospital and quarantine area for treatment of animals suffering from infectious and conta gious diseases Shri Dipankar Gupta, learned counsel for the Taj Group of Hotels and Shri Gooptu learned counsel for the State of West Bengal argued that the former facilities available in the four arce plot of land were not displaced but were replaced and preserved by better facilities in the adjacent plot of land We are satisfied that the question of obstruction which may be caused to migratory birds did not go unnoticed by the Government before the deciSion to lease the land was taken and we are also satisfied that the building of the proposed hotel is not likely to cause any obstruction to the flight path of the migratory birds The difference between sale of land and other readily saleable commodities and the allotment of land for estab lishing a modern Five Star Hotel of International standard is so obvious as to need no more explanation This record of the proceedings shows that the Experts Com mittee of the Wild Life Fund was proceeding on the fundamen tal wrong assumption that the hotel was proposed to be constructed "within the premises of Alipore Zoo" Shri Tata further suggested that if necessary the Prime Minister could appoint a small advisory Committee consisting of Shri Pushpa Kumar, Director of the Hyderabad Zoo consid ered to be the finest zoo in India and one of the best in Asia, Dr Biswas, Mrs Anne Wright and the Chairman of the Managing Committee of the Zoological Garden to advise on the subject They could have moved the Government or taken other steps to expedite the starting of an additional Zoo with a larger extent which the Government promised of the proposed new structures should be supplied by the Alipur Zoological Garden to the lessee There was no report that the existing multistoreyed buildings had any adverse affect on the migratory birds or the animals The question raised in the present case is whether the Government of West Bengal has shown such lack of awareness of the problem of environment in making an 242 allotment of land for the construction of a Five Star Hotel at the expense of the zoological garden that it warrants interference by this Court? The India Hotels Co Ltd will find out in consultation with and with the concurrence of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services Department of this Government and the authorities of the Alipore Zoological Garden the period of time required for reconstruction of the essential structures standing on the land proposed to be leased out to the said company So we will consider your offer to buy our land In this letter, the Chief Minister pointed out that there were already in existence a number of multistoreyed buildings all around the Zoological Garden, but there was no report that they had any adverse effect on the migratory birds or the animals The further submission of Dr Singhvi was that whatever might have been the terms of the grant in favour of the Zoological Garden, the Bengal Parks Act, 1904, vested the land in favour of the Zoological Garden and there was no way by which the Government could divest the Zoological Garden of the land except by a procedure known to the law such as acquisition or requisition The Zoological Garden Committee being reimbursed for any expenditure they may have incurred in building there" We are satisfied that for the purposes of the present case, we will be justified in proceeding on the basis that the land which was undoubt edly Government land, to start with, was given to the Zoo logical Garden upon the terms set out in the two letters Thereafter the Chief Minsiter along with the Minister of Tourism and the Minister for Metropolitan Development visited the site accompanied by the Director of the Zoo who apparently knew about the pro posal right from the start Governor for the transfer of the land to the east of Belvedere Road, known as Begumbari land to the charge of the Committee of the Zoolog ical Garden on the terms agreed to by the Committee in their letter dated April 23rd The decision was taken without considering the impact on the Zoo and without consulting various interested authorities and institutions The report of WEBCON is a 246 comprehensive report on various topics connected with the establishment of a Five Star Hotel in Calcutta Meanwhile, it appeared that the Public Undertakings Committee appointed by the West Bengal Legislative Assembly submitted a port on February 14, 1981 about the zoo in which they stated It was mentioned in the letter that the construction of the hotel should not be started till the lease deed was executed and registered We must remember that the process of choosing and allotting the land to the Taj Group of Hotels took merely two years, during the course of which objections of various kinds were raised from time to time He also pointed out that all precautions would be taken in the matter of illumination of the hotel and lay out of the surroundings so that no disturbance would be caused to the flight path of the birds or animals Therefore, it is clear that it was not forgotten that if the land was to be allotted to the Taj Group, separate provision would have to be made for whatever use the land was being put to them It was outside the Zoological Garden and separated from it by a 80 100 feet road The Bengal Land Manual prescribed the procedure to be followed in the matter of transferring land belonging to the Government They agreed to keep the surroundings of the hotel and the flora well main tained Stress was laid on the direct and indirect economic activities which would be generated by the establishment of a Five Star Hotel They agreed to build not the usual skyscrapper hotel, but a garden hotel, the height of which would not go beyond 75 feet, despite the fact that there existed in the surrounding area buildings which were very high Applying these tests, we find it impossible to hold that the Government of West Bengal, did not act with probity in not inviting tenders or in not holding a public auction but negotiating straightaway at arm 's length with the Taj Group of Hotels The zoo is situated on the left bank of the Tolly 's Nallla divided with two parts on either said of the Alipore Road The Taj Group was invited to send the financial projection on the basis of the second alternative It will also let this department have in consultation with and with the concurrence of the Animal Hus bandry and Veterinary Services Department of this Government and the Alipore Zoological Garden a plan and estimate for reconstruction of the aforesaid essential structures on the land adjacent to the land proposed to be leased out, so that all these points are incorporated in the deed of lease between the said company and the State Government in this Department for the said land measuring four acres It may also be stated in this connection that the Zoo cannot be run for a single day without these essential services, ie The learned counsel for the Taj Group made available to us, the method adopted On the other hand there was going to be an environmental improve ment of the area as the dumping ground, burial ground and the semi dilapidated buildings were to be replaced by a hotel surrounded by broad roads and a very large number of trees proposed to be planted by the hotel management There was no occassion for the Government to invite tenders since the establishment of a Five Star hotel was not something which could practicably be undertaken by anyone in that fashion He pointed out that the four acre plot was not within the main Zoological Garden, but was separated from it by the Belvedere Road which was an important thoroughfare in the city "In view of the letter issued to the Zoologi cal Gardens, Alipore and the Cabinet decision regarding the land of Begumbari Compound and in consideration of the assurance conveyed through Shri Ashoka Bose, Chief Whip and Member that the State Government will give to the Garden adjacent lands and matching grants for the purposes of shifting of the Depart ments of the Zoo within the said compound, the members do not press their objections as contained in the resolution of the Managing Committee held on 11681 In regard to the Begumbari property, it was stated: "From the property of the Zoological Gardens on the Belvedere Road it is possible to carve out about four acres of land currently used for dumping garbage and also for 244 growing grass for the elephants
