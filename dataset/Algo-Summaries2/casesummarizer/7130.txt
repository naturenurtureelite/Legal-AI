suit was not identical to the relief claimed in the previous suit That suit was for a declaration that the plaintiff was a lessee and for an injunction to restrain the defendants from interfering with his possession of the suit property Take the case of suit where possession of agricultural land is sought on the plea that the defendant is a trespasser and the defendant contends that he is a tenant In the previous suit the relief for possession was not claimed whereas in the second suit the relief was for restoration of possession It was only thereafter that the plaintiff filed the suit for restoration of his possession On the dismissal of the said suit the original plaintiff filed another suit No However, the Act does not preclude the institution of a suit by a tenant for restoration of possession from a trespasser The first ground on which the High Court dismissed the suit is that the suit was barred by the principle of res judicata in view of the dismissal of the former suit No It is only when the subject matter of any suit is directly and substantially in issue in the previous suit that the subsequent suit would be barred by res judicata if the competent court trying it had decided the issue regarding tenancy against the plaintiff It was for this technical reason that the suit was dismissed Therefore, the question which arose in the suit was whether defendant No1 proved that he was a tenant in respect of the land in question It is not the finding of the High Court that in the previous suit the question regarding the tenancy of the plaintiff was determined against the plaintiff It says that a tenant entitled to possession of any land under any of the provisions of the Act may apply in writing for such possession to the Mamlatdar If he relinquishes any claim to bring the suit within the jurisdiction of any court he will not be entitled to claim that relief in any subsequent suit In that suit the issue regarding the status of the plaintiff as a lessee was not settled once for all and hence that issue could not be stated to be barred by res judicata in the subsequent suit brought by the lessee for possession the demised property He impleaded the owner of the land as defendant No2 on the plea that she had colluded with defendant No1 With a view to preventing any such action on the part of the defendants he instituted the suit for an injunction to restrain them from so doing 1 by defendant No The said suit was dismissed on Match 28, 1974 on the ground that the plaintiff was no more in possession of the suit property and, therefore, a suit for a mere declaration simpliciter could not lie Once it was found that the plaintiff was not in actual physical possession of the demised property, the suit had become infructuous Therefore, the cause of action for the former suit was based on an apprehension that the defendants were likely to forcibly dispossess the plaintiff (iii) Whether the tenancy of any deemed tenant is legally terminated and if no, whether the tenant evicted from the land held by him as such is entitled to restoration of possession? As the record stands the only ground on which the previous suit 1022 was dismissed was the technical ground that a suit for a mere declaration cannot lie without claiming possession once it is found that the plaintiff had lost possession Now Order 2 concerns the framing of a suit Thus the amendment came into force during the pendency of the suit He had on October 26, 1968 instituted a suit No It would not stand to reason to non suit the plaintiff who had filed the suit in a competent court having jurisdiction to try the same merely because of the subsequent change in law The foundation for that suit was that the plaintiff who claimed to be a lessee in respect of the demised property apprehended his forcible dispossession therefrom The lands in question were agricultural lands It would seem unfair to non suit the plaintiff altogether for no fault of his own The first suit was dismissed on the technical ground that since the plaintiff was not in de facto possession no injunction could be granted and a suit for a mere declaration of status without seeking the consequential relief for possession could not lie The defendants, therefore, contended that the suit was not maintainable and deserved to be dismissed Defendant No1 raised a contention in his written statement that he was lawfully inducted as a tenant in the lands in question 1030 by the owner, defendant No2 It will be seen from the aforesaid provisions that the forum created for determination of the question whether a person is a 1026 tenant or a deemed tenant under the Act is the Mamlatdar In such a situation the Civil Court would not be competent to pass any order for restoration of possession to the deemed tenant 1 in collusion with defendant No2 and decreed the suit for eviction on September 25, 1985 As stated earlier, the first suit was dismissed on a technical ground that the suit for a mere declaration without seeking consequential relief of possession could not lie If the decision of the Mamlatdar is in favour of the party raising the plea, the suit for possession would have to be dismissed, because it would not be open to the Civil Court to give any relief to the landlord by way of possession of the agricultural land But the Rule does not preclude a second suit based on a distinct cause of action The law was silent as to how a dispute of this nature raised in a suit filed for eviction on the footing that the defendant is a trespasser should be dealt withby the Civil Court The cause of action for the former suit was not based on the allegation that the possession of the plaintiff was forcibly taken sometime in the second week of June, 1968 The High Court, in the backdrop of these facts, came to the conclusion that the subject matter of the second suit was directly and substantially in issue in the previous suit between the same parties and hence regardless of the relief claimed the second suit was clearly barred by res judicata Unless the tenancy is terminated in the manner provided by section 9, the law precludes the landowner from terminating the tenancy and obtaining possession of the land from the tenant The plaintiff, therefore, contended that defendant No The facts of the case clearly reveal that the res invoked in both the suits is the same It will thus be seen that the Act sets up an independent machinery and invests the Mamlatdar with jurisdiction to decide questions such as : (i) Whether any person is a tenant or should be deemed to be a tenant under the Act? Section 7 posits that if any question arises whether any person is a tenant or should be deemed to be a tenant under the Act, the Mamlatdar shall after holding an enquiry decide such question He, therefore, sought possession of the demised property from the trespasser, defendant No1 By virtue of section 7 any question whether a person is a tenant or a deemed tenant was required to be decided by the Mamlatdar and the jurisdiction of the Civil Court stood ousted by section 58(2) of the Act We are, therefore, of the opinion that it would be just and fair that the issue whether defendant No1 was a tenant in respect of the lands in question should be referred to the Mamlatdar for decision and after his decision is received by the Civil Court if the issue is held against defendant No1, the Civil Court may consider passing of a decree in eviction but if on the other hand he is held to be tenant, the Civil Court may be required to dismiss the suit
