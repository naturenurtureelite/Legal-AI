(1) of section 630 of the Act makes it an offence where any officer or employee of a company wrongfully withholds possession of 175 such property of the company It is submitted that on a true construction, the scope and effect of the section was limited to such property of the company which was wrongfully obtained by an officer or employee of the company (a), namely, where an officer or employee of a company wrongfully obtains possession of any property of the company during the course of his employment, to which he is not entitled Normally, it is only the present officers and employees who can secure possession of any property of a company Section 630 of the Act which makes the wrongful withholding of any property of a company by an officer or employee of the company a penal offence, is typical of the economy of language which is characteristic of the draughtsman of the Act It may well be that an officer or employee may have lawfully obtained possession of any such property during the course of his employment but wrongfully withholds it after the termination of his employment (a) of section 630(1) was referable to existing officer or employee of a company, while cl We accordingly uphold the view of the High Court of Bombay that the terms 'officer or employee ' of a company applies not only to existing officers or employees but also to past officers or employees if such officer or employee either (a) wrongfully obtains possession of any property, or (b) having obtained such property during the course of his employment, withholds the same after the termination of his employment The beneficent provision contained in section 630 no doubt penal, has been purposely enacted by the legislature with the object of providing a summary procedure for retrieving the property of the company (a) where an officer or employee of a company wrongfully obtains possession of property of the company, or (b) where having been placed in possession of any such property during the course of his employment Secondly, it is contended that the legislature never intended to include past officers and employees of a company within the ambit of section 630 of the Act which provides for prosecution of an officer or employee of a company for wrongfully withholding the property of the company inasmuch as it has used different languages where it was so intended, namely, in sections 538 and 545 (b) contemplates a case where an officer or employee of a company having any property of a company in his possession wrongfully withholds it or knowingly applies it to purposes other than those expressed or directed in the 176 articles and authorised by the Act (b) relate to any property of a company as mentioned in cl The High Court of Bombay, on the other hand, has placed a beneficent construction on the provisions contained in section 630 and according to it, the term 'officer or employee ' in sub section
(1) of section 630 must be interpreted to mean not only the present officers and employees of a company but also to include past officers and employees of the company (b) also makes it an offence if any officer or employee of a company having any property of the company in his possession knowingly applies it to purposes other than those expressed or directed in the articles and authorised by the Act The controversy is as to the meaning of the term 'officer or employee ' used in sub s(1) of section 630 and as to the meaning of the words 'any such property ' in cl That would primarily apply to the present officers and employees and may also include past officers and employees This is the function of cl It also held that the words 'any such property ' in section 630(l)(b) relate to property specified in cl In view of this, the company was constrained to lodge a complaint against the petitioner under section 630 of the Act in the Court of the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, 37th Court, Esplanade, Bombay alleging that he was wrongfully withholding the flat in question which had been given to him for his residence during the period of his employment and and thereby committed an offence punishable under section 630 It is also of the view that the words 'any such property ' in ck (b) qualify the words 'any property of a company ' appearing in cl The petitioner there was the General Manager of a company known as the English Electrical Company of India Limited, a company incorporated under the having its registered office at Calcutta Penalty for wrongful withholding of property (1) If any officer or employee of a company (a) wrongfully obtains possession of any property of a company; or D (b) having any such property in his possession wrongfully withholds it or knowingly applies it to purposes other than those expressed or directed in the articles and authorised by this Act; he shall, on the complaint of the company or any creditor or contributory thereof, be punishable with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees
