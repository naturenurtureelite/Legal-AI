of the firm "The business of the Firm shall be carried on by Partner No The continuance cannot be a continuance of the firm or business of the partnership of 1918 for annexure C I makes no reference to that partnership at all No question of the dissolution of the firm Sait Nagjee Purushotham & Co ever arose The Firm shall continue to be as of old namely Sait Nagjee Purushotham & Co Therefore, the firm mentioned in annexure C I is a new firm and not the old 1918 firm reconstituted ' Judged from this standpoint, the entry of Hemchand was not a dissolution of the firm of Sait Nagjee Purushotham and Co The recital provides that the remaining partners of the firm constituted by the instrument of 1918 agreed to carry on and continue the existing partnership business The question, however is, was this firm a firm which had been carrying on a business on April 1, 1939 and which business had been charged to tax under the Act of 1918? He had paid tax in respect of the business under the Act of 1918 The Firm shall continue to do business in the manufacture and sale of soaps under the name of the "Vegetable Soap Works" and in umbrellas under the name of "Sait Nagjee Purushotham & Co Soap and Umbrella Merchants All the partners hereby agree that they in their individual capacity are and shall be Partners also along with Hemchand Veerji Sait in a Partnership business in Soaps and Umbrellas carried on in Calicut and Madras under the name and style of Sait Nagjee Purushotham & Co, Soap and Umbrella Merchants and in Bombay under the name and style of Shah, Nagjee Purushotham & Co the terms and conditions whereof are embodied in an Agreement of Partnership dated 30 5 1939 signed by all the Partners" The High Court held on reference that the firm constituted under the deed of 1918 was dissolved in 1939 and the firms constituted under the two deeds of 1939 were dissolved in 1943 The firm name shall be "Sait Nagjee Purushotham & Co Bankers, Piece goods, Yarn, Soap and Umbrella merchants
" So the firm created by annexure C I could not have been a ,continuation of the 1918 partnership C2 was executed by Nagjee, Narayanjee and Manecklal (20) All the partners hereby agree that they in their individual capacity are and shall be Partners also along with Hemchand Veerjee Sait in a Partnership business in Soaps and Umbrellas carried on in Calicut and Madras under the name and style of Sait Nagjee Purushotham and Co, Soap and Umbrella Merchants and in Bombay under the name and style of Shah Nagjee Purushotham & Co, the terms and conditions whereof are embodied in an Agreement of Partnership dated 30 5 1939 signed by all the Partners In the deed of 1918, it was stated that this firm carried on business in Calicut, having branches at Madras and Bombay and though Manecklal was included as a new partner, the firm was to carry on and continue the existing partnership business under the same name and style So the business must have been in existence sometime between 1918 and 1922 The appellant is a firm which in 1948 consisted of four partners namely Manecklal Purushotham, Liladhar Narayanjee, Jayanand Nagjee and Prabhulal Naranji 113 And whereas the remaining partners along with the new partners now included in the Deed of Partnership, have agreed to carry on and con tinue as one, single partnership business, the existing partnership businesses of "Sait Nagjee Purushotham & Co, Bankers, Piece goods and Yarn merchants, "Sait Nagjee Purushotham & Co (25) all the parties to annexure C I agreed that the firm constituted by Nagjee, Narayanjee and Maneklal was a different firm 1 to 3 herein are the Partners of the Firm of Sait Nagjee Purushotham & Co, Bankers, Piece goods and Yam merchants, Calicut
" Further, as ,clearly appears from annexure C 11, the firm brought into existence by the 1918 instrument was dissolved and a new firm was started between Nagjee, Narayanjee and Manecklal after the retirement of Purushotham in 1934 In that year, the firm consisted of Nagjee, Narayanjee and Manecklal who were members of the original family Cl was executed by Nagjee, Narayanjee, Manecklal and Hemchand 2The partners of the firm are (1) Narayanjee Purushotham Sait, (2) Manecklal Purshotham Sait, (3) Jayanand Nagjee Sait (Minor) represented by guardian Manecklal Purushotham Sait (4) Leeladhar Narayanjee Sait and (5) Prabhulal Narayanjee Sait" It was found that only the money lending business had paid tax under the Indian Income tax Act of 1918 Soap and Umbrella Merchants", and at Bombay of "Sha Nagjee Purushotham & Co" Annexure C I shows that in Octo ber/November of that year a new partnership was started to do businesses of manufacture and sale of soap and umbrella between Hemraj and the remaining partners of the preexisting firm of the same name, that is, Nagjee, Narayanjee and Manecklal In 1918, and in 1934 different deeds were executed but the basic deed was that of 1918 98 from time to time but the firm has never been dissolved so that it has been the same firm continuing and carrying on the same business from before 1918 till the transfer afore said This would show that the old partnership of 1918 had given up doing some of its existing businesses and it was decided to carry them on under a new partnership agreement Soap and Umbrella merchants" Indeed, the agreement to separate the umbrella and soap business when Hemchand was admitted as a partner in 1939 was in keeping with the continuance of the original business as an entity by itself and emphasised its separate character In either case it is the assessment of the income of the firm The Tribunal also held that the business in soap and umbrella was different from the business of banking, piece goods and yarn, and the amalgamation of these two businesses in 1943 amounted to a succession by a newly constituted firm It seems to us beyond question that the partnership mentioned in annexure C I is different from the partnership which was brought about by the instrument of December 6, 1918 for the partners in the two firms were not the same There is no reference in annexure C I to the firm constituted by the instrument of December 6, 1918 In Cl the preamble was as follows: "Whereas Partners 1 to 4 have been carrying on a business as Partners from the beginning of Samvat 1994 (Guzarathi Era) in the manufacture and sale of Soaps under the name of "The Vegetable Soap Works" Proprietors Sait Nagjee Purushotham & Co, and in the manufacture and sale of Umbrellas in Calicut with branches at Madras and Bombay under the name and style of Sait Nagjee Purushotham & Co, Soap and Umbrella Merchants at Calicut and Madras and in the name of Sha Nagjee Purushotham & Co at Bombay hereinafter called the Firm
" It may be 105 that the partnership of 1918 was carried on in the same name as the firm referred to in annexure C I but we are not ,aware that an identity of names establishes that the two firms are same Sometime in the year 1932 or thereabout, the firm had started the manufacture and sale of soaps under the name of "The Vegetable Soap Works" Proprietors Sait Nagjee Purushotham & Co and perhaps the manufacture and sale of umbrellas in Calicut with branches at Madras and Bombay under the name and style, at Calicut and Madras, of "Sait Nagjee Purushotham & Co "This agreement of partnership between (1) Nagjee What was then carried on must have been some other business Discontinuance is thus not a mere change in the constitution of the firm nor even succession where, though the business changes hands, the business itself is carried on 15,000 as deposit in the Firm of Sait Nagjee Purushotham & Co
