There the list was provisional It was an opportunity to be given before the final list was to be declared and published as a final list If he was to have that opportunity the list would not really be final but only provisional or preliminary this line of attack upon the final list His grievance seemed to be that he was not heard after the final list was prepared No element of punishment at all is involved in preparing either a provisional or a final seniority list But, once he has had that opportunity, it cannot possibly be said that he should have a further opportunity against even a final seniority list Therefore, it was held that the writ petition was premature as the final list of officers on an integrated seniority list was still to be prepared after hearing objections an opportunity to object to the proposed assign ment of a place to him in the seniority list It is apparent that the petitioner re spondent was claiming relief against the final Inter State seniority list although he was given due opportunity to object to the provi sional list Evidently what was meant was that the publication gave the list finality All that is done is that certain principles are applied in the preparation of the list Even a list purporting to be final can be vitiated by non observance of conditions prece dent Now, Shankariah 's case (supra) was con fined to an admission on behalf of the Central Government that the list before the Court was provisional so that the petitioners before the Court on that occasion were to get opportuni ties of puting forward their objections before the final list is prepared Roy 's case (supra), the opportunity afforded was to be given before the publication of the final list It will be obviously contradictory to hold it to be a final list and yet declare it Subject to modifica tions on further objections 115 of the Act, has to determine the princi ples governing equation of posts and prepare a common gradation list by integration of services In order to establish the invalidity of the final list on some such grounds of invalidity, those grounds have to be shown to exist The Central Government is bound to ensure a fair and equitable treatment to officers in the matter of integration of services and preparation of gradation lists
