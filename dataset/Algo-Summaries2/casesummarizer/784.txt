According to the argument the third proviso is not an independent proviso but is a sort of proviso to the second proviso Then we come to the provisos But this is to read the third proviso as a proviso not to the section, but to the second proviso and there is no warrant in law for such a construction That the third proviso does not govern the second proviso is also clear if the scope of the two provisos is examined The argument is that the second proviso is merely declaratory and the third proviso supplies the machinery for giving effect to the provisions of the second proviso In that sense the second proviso would be a self contained proviso and the aid of the third proviso would be wholly uncalled for If the third proviso at all applied to rights created after July 1, 1945, then the second proviso would be otiose and need not have been enacted at all In our opinion the third proviso deals with the termination of rights created before July 1, 1945 Under the second proviso, leases for a period exceeding one year and created after 1st July, 1945, are not enforceable against the Government that notice as to why the lease should not be terminated without any compensation under the second proviso to section 20(1) of the Abolition Act The second proviso makes rights created after July 1, 1945, unenforceable as against the Government It is said that the words " such right " in the third proviso relate to the rights mentioned in the second proviso, that is to say, rights created on or after July 1, 1945 There is no warrant for saying that the avoidance must be under the terms of the third proviso The argument of the petitioners is that the words " such rights " in the third proviso have reference to the rights created after the 1st July, 1945, mentioned in the previous proviso and on that construction, the lease in favour of the petitioners could be terminated only in accordance with that proviso by giving three months ' notice Then again, there is in proviso (iii) an exception with reference to rights created over private lands; there is nothing corresponding to it in the second proviso and that also shows that the scope of the two provisos is different In other words, the third proviso, according to learned counsel 559 for the appellant, merely enables the Government to exercise the right conferred on it by the second proviso and therefore, the Government, if it intends to avail itself of the right under the second proviso, must comply with the conditions laid down in the third proviso
