441 of 1981 or in equivalent grades in the matter of promotion This circular had indeed the effect of accelerating t he chance of promotion It w as further urged that the petitioners of these writ petitio ns were on the basis of the Rules considered for promotion a nd it is not disputed that all of them have in due course be en promoted as Chargeman II and some of them have even be en promoted to higher posts The question of promotion of Diploma holders in Mech/Elec It appears th at the criterion of promotion is seniority cum merit "Our attention has been invited by learned counsel for bo th the sides to the relevant rules which govern promotion to the post of Chargeman Grade II 441 of 1981 was preferred in this Court It w as only such a Supervisor Grade 'A ' whose name found place in the selection list who could be promoted to the post of Chargeman II as and when vacancies were available (ii) All those Diploma holders who work satisfactorily as Supervisor 'A ' (Tech) or in equivalent grades for 2 years in Ordnance Factory should be promoted to Chargeman It h as further been stated therein that after the newly creat ed posts were thus filled by promotion, chances of promotion of those who were appointed subsequently diminished and f or want of sufficient number of 108 vacancies as Chargeman II they could not be promoted to th at post soon after the completion of 2 years ' service The right to promotion on the oth er hand was to be governed by the Rules In oth er words it resulted in delayed chance of promotion 441 of 1981 deserve to be granted the same limi t ed relief With regard to the circular dated 6 th November, 1962 the learned Judges took the view that it w as difficult to read in that circular any intention or delibe r ation on the part of the Director General of Ordnance Fact o ries that as soon as two years were completed by a diplo ma holder in the Grade of Supervisor 'A ' there would be an automatic promotion to the post of Chargeman Il The grievance of the petitio n ers, however, is that this promotion tantamounts to impl e mentation of the order of this Court dated 2nd Februar y, 1981 only on paper inasmuch as they have not been grant ed the difference of back wages and promotion to higher pos ts on the basis of their back date promotion as Chargeman I I 3812 19 of 1983 with regard to a matter relevant for promotion The ord er dated 28th December, 1965 which provided a minimum period of service of three years in the lower grade for promotion to the next higher grade and the circular dated 20th Janua ry 1966 which provided that promotions in future will be e f fected in accordance with the normal rules and not merely on completion of 2 years ' satisfactory continuous service h ad the effect of doing away with the accelerated chance of promotion and relegating Supervisors 'A ' in the matter of promotion to the normal position as it obtained under t he Rules The writ petition w as contested by the respondents thereto inter alia on t he ground that under the rules of promotion from Supervisor ' A ' to Chargeman II first Departmental Promotion Committee at the factory level and then a Departmental Committee at t he Central level screens the service record of each of t he Supervisors 'A ' who comes within the range of eligibili ty and then finally the Director General of Ordnance Factori es draws up a list and sanctions promotions The said Annexure further indicates that o ut of the 1175 recruits about 625 were promoted to the post of Chargeman II in 1965 66 under the 2 year policy contained in circular dated 6th November, 1962 and that approximately 5 50 diploma holders were denied promotion which resulted in discrimination Their grievance in the writ petition was that ev en though quite a large number of Supervisors Grade 'A ' h ad been promoted to the post of Chargeman grade II on compl e tion of two years ' satisfactory work they had been discrim i nated against and had not been so promoted immediately on the expiry of two years ' in pursuance of the aforesa id circular even though their work was satisfactory The only effect of t he circular dated 6th November, 1962 was that Supervisors ' A ' on completion of 2 years ' satisfactory service could be promoted by following the procedure contemplated by Rule 8 Howeve r, merely on completion of two years ' service a Supervisor ' A ' could not claim automatic promotion Apparently, after t he coming into force of the 107 order dated 28th December, 1965 and the circular dated 20 th January, 1966 promotions could not be made just on compl e tion of 2 years ' satisfactory service under the earli er circular dated 6th November, 1962 the same having be en superseded by the later circular 441 of 1981 they would perhaps not ha ve even thought of filing these writ petitions inasmuch as in the meantime they had not only been promoted in the norm al course as Chargeman 1I but some of them had been promot ed even to higher posts in the hierarchy If a large number of other persons similar ly situated have been promoted as Chargeman Grade II aft er completing two years of service, there is no reason why t he appellants should also not be similarly promoted aft er completing the same period of service It was urged that after the issue of the subseque nt order dated 28th December, 1965 and circular dated 20 th January, 1966 no Supervisor 'A ' could claim to have beco me eligible for promotion merely on completion of 2 year s ' satisfactory service and his promotion thereafter could be effected only in accordance with the normal Rules According to learn ed counsel the Rules did not prescribe the minimum number of years of service as Supervisors 'A ' which would make th em eligible for promotion as Chargeman II and the circul ar dated 6th November, 1962 which was in the nature of an executive instruction prescribed 2 years ' service as Supe r visor 'A ' to make him eligible for promotion 441 of 1981, which indicates that but for the decisi on in Civil Appeal No It was furth er asserted that in accordance with the said rule the cases of all the appellants were screened by the Promotion Committ ee at the factory level and then at the Central level and th ey not having been found fit were not promoted 441 of 198 1 441 of 1981 and the petitioners in the writ petitions deci d ed by the Madhya Pradesh High Court on 4th April, 1983 We are not suggesti ng that the appellants are entitled to be promoted to t he aforesaid posts even if they are found unfit to be promote d
We Therefore direct that the concerned authoriti es will consider the cases of the appellants for promotion as Chargeman Grade II and promote them to the said posts unle ss they are found to be unfit If the appellants are promote d, they will naturally have to be promoted with effect from t he date on which they ought to have been promoted 441 of 1981 applies to these writ petitions al so and the same relief may accordingly be granted to the pet i tioners In so far as Supervisors 'A ' who claimed promotion as Chargeman 11 the following direction was accordingly giv en by the Madhya Pradesh High Court in its judgment dated 4 th April, 1983 aforesaid: "All these petitioners are also entitled to be treated as Chargeman Grade II on completion of two years satisfacto ry service as Supervisor Grade A Consequently, notion al seniority of these persons have to be refixed in Supervis or Grade A, Chargeman Grade II, Grade I and Assistant Forem an in cases of those who are holding that post  
T he petitioners are also entitled to get their present sala ry re fixed after giving them notional seniority so that t he same is not lower than those who are immediately bel ow them
" While repelling this submission the Constituti on Bench held: "All that happened as a result of making promotions to t he posts of Deputy Collectors divisionwise and limiting su ch promotions to 50 per cent of the total number of vacanci es in the posts of Deputy Collector was to reduce the chanc es of promotion available to the petitioners
