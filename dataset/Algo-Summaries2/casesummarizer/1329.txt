The sellers ' case is that these were sales on FOB contracts The second circumstance to which our attention has been drawn is that the export was under the contract to be under the buyer 's export licence   that the goods for the export of which licence is granted shall be the property of the licensee at the time of the export " The ordinary rule in FOB contracts is that it is the duty of the buyer to obtain the necessary export licence Consequently the time of the export is when the ship with the goods goes be yond the territorial limits At any rate, the export of the goods cannot be considered to have commenced before the ship carrying goods leaves the port If such despatch outside the State of Bombay is by a person to whom the certifying dealer has sold the goods but who is not a registered dealer the certificate has not been complied with The normal rule in FOB contracts is that the property is intended to pass and does pass on the shipment of the goods He relies on three circumstances to convince us that the sellers and their buyers agreed in these sales that the property will pass to the buyer even before shipment There can be no doubt therefore that these were sales under FOB contracts ' The Sales Tax Officer rejected this claim for exemption and assessed them to sales tax on a taxable turnover including these sales On that definition the time of the export is the time when the goods go out of the territorial limits of India It is argued that the time of the export should be interpreted as the time when the customs frontier is crossed and that we must proceed on the basis that the buyer and the sellers intended that the goods shall be the buyer 's property at the point of time when they crossed this frontier
