the flat increase of Rs 100/ above the existing wage scales 150/ to each draughtsman and Rs 150/ and Rs 150/ and of Rs 150/ in the category of Draughtsmen and Rs 150/ in the category of Draughtsman and Rs 150/  to grant flat increase of Rs Since there was to be a flat increase of Rs Again, if the flat increase is Rs 100/ to each employee in the other categories has been granted under my award 150/ and again after the figure Rs 150/ to each of the employees in the category of Draftsmen and of Rs 150/ in the category of Draftsmen and Rs 150/ to each workman in the case of Draughtsman and Rs 150/ in the case of the category of Draughtsmen and Rs That the increase was pertinent to the general pay scales in the revised wage structure is patently clear from a comparison of the existing pay scales and the revised pay scales Likewise, if a flat increase of Rs 150/ to each of the employees in the category of Draftsmen and 181 of Rs 100/ in the initial pay fixed in each scale, the increase in the case of the category of Draughtsmen being Rs 100/ in the case of other categories to the initial pay in the wage scales pertaining to those categories 100/ was intended to each of the employees in the category of Draughtsmen and the other categories One is the retrospectivity attached to the revised wage scales, and the other is the flat increase given to each 174 employee of Rs No second flat increase was envisaged at all It will be noted that the pay scales of different categories were being restructured, and the flat increase envisaged there related to an increase in the general pay scales of different categories The revised pay scales of all categories, except the category of Draughtsmen, shows an increase of Rs 100/ to all other workmen in their basic pay 150/ in the case of Draftsmen and Rs The statement then goes on to indicate that if a flat increase of Rs There was only one increase contemplated in the award, in paragraph 23 of award, and it is more than plain that the increase was the one incorporated in the revised pay scales pertaining to different categories The Tribunal maintained the existing schemes of dearness allowance and house rent allowance, and observed that in view of the revised basic wages there would be a resultant increase in the dearness allowance and house rent allowance The Tribunal took note of the elaborate scales of wages already existing in the wage structure of the appellant and decided "to modify the existing structure of the scales with flat increases in each category
" 100/ in the case of draftsmen and other workmen respectively, the revised wage scale had necessarily to commence with figures Rs Implicit and intrinsically connected with the question of revision of the wage scales were the questions of fitment of employees into the wage scales and flat or ad hoc increase of salaries of workmen wherever considered necessary It was clearly so intended by the Tribunal as is evident from the reference to "flat increase of Rs Conspicuous by its absence is any reference to a flat increase in the pay of an individual workmen Nor can it be doubted that fitment into the revised pay scales is certainly a part of the revision of pay scales Further, it appears that the Tribunal intended to grant the increase of Rs 100/ respectively and might contend that the Tribunal had only revised the wage scales by increasing the salary on entry into the service and res 184 tructuring the scale of pay and never granted any ad hoc increase of salary to all employees The Award of the Industrial Tribunal was made on December 20, 1978 None of the alternatives was actually adopted by the Tribunal, because when the award was made the Tribunal proceeded instead to restructure the wage scales by the addition of Rs The Tribunal then considered the question whether Draftsmen should get a higher flat increase and the question whether the existing scheme of Dearness Allowance should be revised The Tribunal has relied on this statement as evidence showing that the appellant knew that a flat increase of Rs The evidence contained in the award throughout provides incontrovertible proof that this flat increase was never originally intended in the award It is urged that the amendment results in the inclusion of a flat increase of Rs The comparative table of existing pay scales and the revised pay scales has been reproduced earlier The only contention of the workmen is that the Tribunal should have fixed the dearness allowance in communion with the cost of living index 100/ in the case of other categories And that is confirmed by what was stated in paragraph 23 of the award: "Considering this outgoing the flat increase of Rs Even when considering the range of permissible retrospectivity the Tribunal stated in the award: "In view of the revision of the wage scales, there would be consequent increase in the dearness allowance and the house rent allowance
" The fitment has also to be done only after the flat increase is added to the present basic salary of each employee 170 The Union filed a statement before the Tribunal claiming an upward revision of the wage scales and dearness allowance and an increase from fifteen years to twenty years in the span for earning annual increments A clear statement of its intention is found in paragraph 22 of the award, where the Tribunal stated: "I only propose to modify the existing structures of the scales with flat increases in each category" There will be no explanation why the initial start of the revised pay scales has been increased by Rs The need for revising the wage scales was not disputed by the appellant This in our opinion is 182 elementary and fundamental to the jurisdiction of the Industrial Tribunal in revising wage scales 5 lakhs mentioned in paragraph 33 of the award represented the result of adding a flat increase to the pay of each workman in addition to the benefits conferred by the revised pay scales and other awarded reliefs 150/ per month was added to the pay of each Draughtsman and a sum of Rs It cannot possibly be doubted that an Industrial Tribunal deciding upon the wage scales of the employees of an establishment would have full liberty to propose ad hoc increase of salaries as part of the revision of wages If the pay of an employee does not coincide with any step in the revised pay scale, and falls between two steps in the reclassified pay scales, the basic pay of that employee shall be fixed at the step higher in the revised scale These statements cannot be regarded as evidence 178 that the appellant was cognizant of the intention of the Tribunal to provide a flat increase to the pay of each workman In view of the increase so secured, the Tribunal rejected the suggestion that a slab system should be introduced in the dearness allowance or that there should be any other modification of the principle on which dearness allowance was being presently granted Individual workmen were not present to the mind of the Tribunal Having regard to the not inconsiderable improvement in the level of the basic wage, it observed that there would be a consequent increase in the dearness allowance and house rent allowance Rs 100/ be added 150/ " were omitted It seems that the Tribunal was betrayed by a curious confusion in accepting the plea of the Union that a flat increase to the pay of each workman was intended in the original wage and, consequently, it fell into the error of amending the award The Tribunal has referred to various considerations which prevailed with it in giving retrospectivity to the revised pay scales 176 No ad hoc increase to the pay of each individual workman was intended The terms of reference in the State Government 's order required the Tribunal to revise the scales of pay and dearness allowance, and there was no mention of giving any ad hoc increase in the basic pay of individual workman The primary and basic question considered by the Industrial Tribunal, in making the award dated December 20, 1978 was the question of revision of the wage scales Considering the fitment of the workman in the revised scales, it was stated in the award that a workman found drawing a salary less than the beginning of the grade would be stepped up to the beginning of the grade and if his pay fell between two steps in the reclassified pay scales the basic pay was to be fixed at the step higher in the revised scale Dearness allowance became payable at 10% of the basic wage subject to a minimum of Rs Taking all these factors into consideration, it made an award dated 20th December, 1978 prescribing the following revision in the existing scales of wages: Grade & Category Existing Grade/ Revised Grade/ Scale Scale I Peon/Helper/ Rs 100/ was clearly an accidental slip or omission which the Tribunal was entitled to correct 100/ in the case of other workmen was called for It also observed that the category of Draughtsmen needed a special increase When the award is sent for publication, a necessary corrigendum be made in the award and the aforesaid words after the figures Rs While workmen raising industrial disputes for revision of wage scales are certainly minded about their future prospects in the matter of wages, they, surely would be more concerned with the immediate benefits according to them That was why the Industrial Tribunal thought that an all round flat increase of Rs 100/ was added to the pay of every other workman, who belonged to the Union staff, the financial load would increase to Rs The addition was integrated as a feature of the wage scales; it was not regarded as an addition to the pay of each individual workman Since the award has been already signed, I do not think anything further can be added to this award
