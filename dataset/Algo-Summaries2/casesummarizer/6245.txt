The recruitment examination was in two stages written and interview/personality test On account of improper feeding into the comput er some of the candidates who had better performance in the written examination were not called and candidates securing lesser marks in the written examination were not only called for interview but were also finally selected We have also not been able to appreciate the justification for cancellation of the written part of the recruitment examina tion and drive the candidates to litigation We have heard counsel for the parties and are of the view that when no defect was pointed out in regard to the written examination and the sole objection was confined to exclusion of a group of successful candidates in the written examination from the interview, there was no justification for cancelling the written part of the recruitment examina tion On the other hand, the situation could have been appropriately met by setting aside the recruitment and asking for a 126 fresh interview of all eligible candidates on the basis of the written examination and select those who on the basis of the written and the freshly held interview became eligible for selection
