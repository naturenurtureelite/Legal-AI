All the employees have often represented that the age of retirement should be raised to 60 Only three of them are now in the service of the Corporation Retirement: The normal age of retirement shall be 60 These employees demanded that their age of retirement should also be fixed at 60 years as in the case of Class III and Class IV employ ees belonging to the category of transferred employees It also provided that in the inter est of the Corporation, the Corporation could retire an employee after completion of 50 years of age But the Corporation may require any employee who has attained the age of 55 to retire if his efficiency is found to have been impaired
" One of them is no longer an employee of the Corporation since he is holding the post of the Chairman of the Corporation It is true that originally employees belonging to Class III and Class IV categories amongst the transferred employees were given the benefit of retirement at the age of 60 years but the employees belong ing to Class III and Class IV categories recruited after 1st September, 1956 were required to retire on the completion of 58 years of age The above regulation fixed the age of retirement of an employee at 55 years while empowering the authority to extend the service of an employee, at its discretion, every year upto 60 years of age We are not concerned in this case with the question whether the age of retirement of employees who have joined the service of the Corporation after 1st September, 1956 should be raised to 60 years An employee belonging to Class III or Class IV and a transferred employee belonging to Class I or Class II shall retire on completion of age 60; but the appointing authority may direct such employee to retire on completion of 55 years of age or at any time thereafter, if his efficiency is found to have been impaired It was only in 1965 under the settlement the age of retirement of employees in Class III and Class IV who joined service after September 1, 1956 was raised to 60 years All employees appointed to the service of the Corporation on or after 1st September, 1956 were required to retire on completion of 58 years of age but the appointing authority was empowered to retire any such employee on completion of 55 years of age or at any time thereafter if his efficiency was found to have been impaired It accordingly held that the 1st Respondent was entitled to continue till he attained the age of 60 years as other Class I employees belonging to the category of transferred employees In the Settlement which was arrived at between the management and the Class III and Class IV em ployees recruited after 1st September, 1956 it was agreed that there should be no discrimination as regards the age of retirement between the employees belonging to Class III and Class IV categories amongst the transferred employees and the Class III and Class IV employees recruited after 1st September, 1956 It would appear that an industrial dispute arose between the Class III and Class IV employees who entered the service of the Corporation on or after 1st September, 1956 and the Corporation and one of the points of dispute related to the age of retirement Hence the age of retirement should be the same in the case of both such promoters All the employees belonging to Class III and Class IV irrespective of the fact whether they were transferred employees or employees appointed after 1st September, 1956 were entitled to continue in service till 60 years of age, but the employees belonging to Class I and Class II, who were appointed to the service of the Corpora tion on or after 1st September, 1956 had to retire on the completion of 58 years of age subject to the usual clause relating to premature retirement 1987 the claim of the employees of the Corporation belonging to class I but appointed after 1st September, 1956 to continue in service till they attained the age of 60 years arose for consideration In the case of the transferred employees the regula tion was in conformity with the standardisation order passed in respect of Class III and Class IV transferred employees in whose case the age of retirement was fixed at 60 years All the transferred employees were entitled to remain in service till they completed 60 years of age but the appointing authority was empowered to retire any such transferred employee on completion of 55 years of age or at any time thereafter if his efficiency was found to have been impaired After the promulgation of the Order the trans ferred employees to whom it applied were entitled to contin ue in the service of the Corporation till they attained the age of 60 years subject to the Corporation exercising its powers to retire a transferred employee on his attaining the age of 55 years if his efficiency was found to have been impaired When the 1st Respondent was promoted to the Class I post in 1963 the age of retirement of offi cers in the Class I post had been fixed at 58 years and was not different from the age of retirement of Class III em ployees The above regulation thus made a distinction between an employee who entered the service of the Corporation after it was estab lished, ie, after 1st September, 1956 and the transferred employees insofar as the age of retirement was concerned The whole time employees of the erstwhile insurers whose services were thus transferred to the Corpo ration are hereinafter referred to as 'the transferred employees ' of the Corporation In almost all the public sector corporations, Central services and State services 58 years age is considered to be a reasonable age at which officers can be directed to retire from their service The fact that the pay, allowances and other conditions of service have been made the same in respect of both the transferred employees and the employees of the Corporation recruited after 1st September, 1956 has not brought about the integration of the two classes of employees into one single cadre It, however, found that when once a transferred employee belonging to Class III and an employee appointed after 1st September, 1956 by the Corporation to a Class III post are promoted to Class I the distinction of transferred employee and direct appointee could not be maintained as on promotion they became persons belonging to the same category of employees enjoying the same conditions of service An employee in Class III of insurer could be continued upto sixty The apparent or inherent intention sought to be achieved by the regulation 19 framed by Corporation was to continue upto age of sixty years the employees of insurers as the age of superannuation in some of the companies was sixty and to derive benefit from expertise and experience of employees who had worked with insurers All the transfer 200 red employees belonging to Class I and Class II became entitled to continue in service till they attained the age of 60 years subject of course to the power of the Corpora tion to retire any of them prematurely on completion of 55 years of age if his efficiency was found to have been im paired and all the Class I and Class II officers appointed to the service of the Corporation on or after 1st September, 1956 had to retire on completion of 58 years of age subject again to the power of the Corporation to retire any such employee on completion of 55 years of age or at any time thereafter if his efficiency was found to have been im paired In the case of those 16 people the Corporation passed a separate order fixing their age of retirement as 60 years having regard to the negotiations which had taken place between the Corporation and the Government before the taking over of their services by the Corporation We have already ex plained earlier the reason for treating the transferred employees differently from the employees appointed after 1st September, 1956 by the Corporation It was pleaded by them that on the establishment of the Corporation under the Act it became necessary to continue the services of the employees of the erstwhile insurers whose life insurance business was taken over by the Corporation to run the business of the Corpora tion because the Corporation had no employees of its own in the month of September, 1956 when it was established The employees of the Corporation were divided lati tudinally into two groups Standardisation Order provides that an employee shall retire at 60 years of age, but the competent authority may require an employee to retire at any time after 55 years of age if his efficiency is found to have been impaired The result was that the regulation made a clear and distinct classification of all the employees of the Corporation belonging to all classes into two groups transferred em ployees and the employees appointed after 1st September, 1956, for purposes of the age of retirement having regard to the historical reasons An employee belonging to Class III or Class IV and a transferred employee belonging to Class I or Class II shall retire on completion of age 60; but the competent authority may, if it is of the opinion that it is in the interest of the Corporation to do so, direct such employee to retire on completion of 55 years of age or at any time thereafter, on giving him three months ' notice or salary in lieu thereof An employee belonging to the Class I or Class II ap pointed to the service of the Corporation on or ' after 1st September, 1956 shall retire on completion of 58 years of age, but the appointing authority may at its discretion, extend his service for one year at a time upto 60 years of age (2) An employee belonging to Class I or Class II appointed to the service of the Corporation on or after 1st September, 1956 shall retire on completion of 58 years of age, but the appointing authority may direct such employee to retire on completion of 55 years of age or at any time thereafter, if his efficiency is found to have been im paired Thereafter only one class of employees would be in the service of the Corpo ration, namely, those appointed subsequent to 1st September, 1956 by the Corporation in respect of whom the Corporation has fixed the age of retirement as 58 years which corre sponds to the age of retirement in almost all the public sector establishments, the Central Government services and the State Government services The Central Government and the Corporation felt that 60 years of age could be a proper age of retirement in the circumstances in respect of the transferred employees and that was the reason why by regulation 19 and the standardisation order issued earlier in the case of certain classes of transferred em ployees under section 11(2) of the Act the retirement age was fixed at 60 years and this was done with a view to retaining the services of the experienced employees of the erstwhile insurers The question is whether the provision is confined to transferred employees only or extends to all employees generally All the transferred employees who have already retired have retired only after completion 60 years An employee shall retire at fifty five years of age provided that the appointing authority may at its discretion extend the service every year upto 60 years of age We do not also find much substance in the contention of the 1st Respondent that there cannot be any discrimination as regards the age of retirement between the employees belonging to Class I and Class II on the one hand and Class III and Class IV on the other Thereafter only the employees who are directly recruited by the Corporation who are about 54,000 in number would continue to remain in its service The Government and the Corporation felt that the services 16 persons who were working in the Department of Insurance were required by the Corporation The conditions of service of these transferred employ ees of the Corporation whose services were transferred to the Corporation under section 11(1) of the Act were not uniform Since as regards the age of retirement there was no uniformity in the establishments in which the transferred employees were working prior to the nationalisation of the life insurance business 203 and as in some cases the age of retirement had been fixed at 55 years, in some other cases it was 58 years, in few other cases at 60 years and in many cases there was no age of retirement and the employees could continue as long as they were found to be physically and mentally fit, it became necessary to fix the age of retirement of the transferred employees on a fair, equitable and just basis The 1st Respondent SS Srivastava entered the service of the Corporation as a Class III employee on 2231957 on which date he was appointed as an Assistant in the Corpora tion Retirement age for new employees: There will be no distinction between Class 111 and Class IV 'transferred employees ' and Class III and Class IV employees who entered the service of the Corporation on or after 191956 in regard to retirement age which shall be 60" After the above settlement was arrived at regulation 19 of the (Staff) Regulations, 1960, which had been brought into force with effect from July 1, 1960, was suitably amended to bring it in conformity with the settlement Regula tion 19 of the (Staff) Regulations, 1960 dealt with the subject of superannuation and retirement of the employees of the Corporation An employee belonging to Class I or Class II appointed to the service of the Corporation on or after 1st September, 1956 shall retire on completion of 58 years of age, but the competent authority may, if it is of the opinion that it is in the interest of the Corporation to do so, direct such employee to retire on completion of 50 years of age or at any time thereafter on giving him three months ' notice or salary in lieu thereof" In my opinion, it is confined to transferred employees When the Corporation was established they were about 27,000 in number and we are informed today that there are only about 22% of those employees in service This Order applied to the members of the staff of the Corporation belonging to Class III and Class IV categories It appears to be the inten tion of Parliament that even as late as in 1981 that the two categories of employees, namely, the transferred employees and employees recruited after 1st September, 1956 in the Corporation should be kept separate A transferred employee shall retire on completion of age 60; but the appointing authority may direct such employ ee to retire on completion of 55 years of age or at any time thereafter, if his efficiency is found to have been im paired 1977 by the Life Insurance Corporation of India (hereinafter referred to as 'the Corporation ') which pro vides that an employee belonging to Class I or Class II appointed to the service of the Corporation on or after 1st September, 1956 shall retire on completion of 58 years of age but the competent authority may, if it is of the opinion that it is in the interest of the Corporation to do so, direct such employee to retire on completion of 50 years of age and at any time thereafter on giving him three months ' notice or salary in lieu thereof Since the Corporation found that the discretion conferred on the appointing authority to extend the services of Class I or Class II officers beyond 58 years of age at its discre tion was not being exercised satisfactory but very often abused, sub regulation (2) was again amended on 2111977 withdrawing the power to extend the service of 201 employees belonging to Class I and Class 11 appointed to the service of the Corporation on or after 1st September, 1956 beyond 58 years of age (page 1031) The decision taken by the Corporation and the Central Government as regards the ages of retirement of the differ ent classes of the employees of the Corporation in the instant case is a bona fide one and cannot be characterised as unreasonable In some cases the age of retirement had been fixed at 55 years, in some at 58 years and in some others at 60 years It is thus seen that at no point of time the transferred employees were integrated into one cadre along with the employees appointed after September 1, 1956 as such and the transferred employees have retained their birth marks throughout Petitioners have contended that the disparity in the age of retirement between two groups of employees gives rise to discriminatory treatment The Corporation was accordingly established on 1st September, 1956 It was urged on behalf of the Corporation and the Union of India that the transferred employees and the employees who joined the service after 1st September, 1956 belonged to two distinct and separate classes which had been treated differently throughout for valid reasons The modification made by the new sub regulation (2) of regulation 19 empowered the appointing authority to extend at its discretion the service of any employee of the Corpo ration belonging to the Class I or Class II categories appointed to the service of the Corporation on or after 1st September, 1956 for one year at a time upto 60 years of age The longitudinal division of the employees was as follows There is provision for the transfer of the assets and liabilities pertaining to the business, of provident funds, 206 superannuation and other like funds, of the services of existing employees of insurers to the Corporation and also of the services of existing employees of chief agents of the insurers to the Corporation, and finally for the payment of compensation to the insurers for the transfer of the busi ness to the Corporation We, however, approve of the reasons given by the High Court of Kerala in holding that the employees of the Corpo ration belonging to Class I and Class II who had entered service of the Corporation after 1st September, 1956 were not entitled to continue in service beyond the age of 58 years In the Writ Petition filed by the 1st Respondent it was contended that there was no justification to prescribe two different ages of retirement one for the transferred employ ees belonging to Class I and Class II categories and the other for the employees who joined the service of the Corpo ration after 1st September, 1956 and who also belonged to Class I and Class II categories Merely because the pay, allowances and other perqui sites drawn by the transferred employees and by the employ ees appointed after 1st September, 1956 by the Corporation are the same it cannot be said that the transferred employ ees and the other employees had been integrated so as to form one cadre In the case of the other employees who joined service subsequent to 1st September, 1956 regulation 21 of the (Staff) Regulations, 1956, which prescribed the age of retirement at 55 years subject to the appointing authority at its discretion extend the age of retirement to 60 years as provided therein, continued to apply
