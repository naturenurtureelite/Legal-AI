There will be a further provision in the decree that the liability arising out of the declaration that the appellant is in Government service is the liability of the State of Gujarat and that the liability for the payment of the arrears of pay is the liability of the State of Maharashtra" The learned counsel for the State of Maharashtra contends that the liability to pay arrears of pay was not a liability arising out of a contract but was a liability in respect of an actionable wrong other than a breach of contract The State of Bombay admitted that the plaintiff was not supplied with a copy of the report of the Enquiry Officer, but pleaded that the plaintiff had not asked for copy of the report and had not been prejudiced by the non supply of the copy of the report The plaintiff is not concerned with the second contention but it is a dispute between the State of Maharashtra and the State of Gujarat It was then said that there were not here concurrent contracts The plaintiff entered service in the Gondal State in 1927 as a jailor The plaintiff was not aware whether the Enquiry Officer reported in his favour or against him Secondly, he contends that the High Court erred in fastening the liability in respect of the arrears of pay on the State of Maharashtra In particular, the liability to pay salary, when it has been fixed, arises out of a contract to pay salary The plaintiff also prayed for a decree for Rs The plaintiff filed a written statement The plaintiff appealed to the High Court claiming arrears of salary and the State of Bombay filed cross objections praying that the suit be dismissed Moreover, as pointed out by the High Court, the Inspector General of Prisons had the report before him and the tentative conclusions arrived at by the Enquiry Officer were bound to influence him, and in depriving the plaintiff of a copy of the report he was handicapped is not knowing what material was influencing the Inspector General of Prisons The plaintiff appeared before that officer and cross examined witnesses 2,690 919 being arrears of pay due to the appellant (plaintiff) upto the date of the suit Where, immediately before the appointed day, the State of Bombay is subject to any liability in respect of any actionable wrong other than breach of contract, that liability shall, (a) if the cause of action arose wholly within the territories which, as from that day, are the territories of the State of Maharashtra or the State of Gujarat, be a liability of that State; and (b) in any other case, be initially a liability of the State of Maharashtra but subject to such financial adjustment as may be agreed upon between the States of Maharashtra and Gujarat or, in default of such agreement, as the Central Government may by order direct" That is the only purpose of the enquiry held by competent officer and the report he makes as a result of the said enquiry" It seems to us that the decree of the High Court decreeing payment of arrears of salary is truly a liability in proceedings relating to a contract within section 60(2)(a) of the Act In the plaint the plaintiff alleged that copy of the enquiry report was never supplied to him, and consequently he had not been given reasonable opportunity within the meaning of article 311 of the Constitution Authority is not lacking even in England where a special relationship exists between the Crown and its public servants The Gondal State merged with the United States of Saurashtra
