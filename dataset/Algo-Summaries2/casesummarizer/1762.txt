In March 1949, the United State of Rajasthan was formed by Covenant entered into by fourteen Rulers of Rajasthan, including these who had formed the Former State of Rajasthan There was also a provision in the Covenant by which the assets and liabilities of the covenanting States became the assets and liabilities of the new State In this State of United State of Rajasthan, the State of Matsya, merged in May 1949, and thus the former State of Dholpur came to be included in the United State of Rajasthan through the Matsya Union Provision was also made in the Covenant that all the assets and liabilities of the covenanting States shall be the assets and liabilities of the new State of Matsya It is also not in dispute that the assets and liabilities of the Matsya Union were taken over as the assets and liabilities of the United State of Rajasthan in which the Matsya Union merged 887 has arisen was filed by the respondent against the State of Rajasthan (1)That case dealt with the Covenant creating the State of Pepsu and particularly article VI thereof The covenant in the State of Pepsu was more or less similar in terms to the Covenant in the United State of Rajasthan The first was that each time a merger took place the new State by a provision in the Covenant took over the assets and liabilities of the merging States It was a new sovereign and was not bound by any obligation against the old sovereign of the former State of Dholpur unless it chose to recognise the obligation Then came another union of certain other Rulers in Rajasthan in March 1948 by which these Rulers united under the Ruler of Udaipur to form what later came to be known as the Former State of Rajasthan The respondent was a resident of the former Dholpur State and the dispute which led to the suit related to a time before the merger of former Dholpur State into the Matsya Union The United State of Rajasthan eventually became the Part B State of Rajasthan on January 26, 1950 when the Constitution came into force Finally the United State of Rajasthan in which the State of Sirohi was also merged became the Part B State of Rajasthan on January 26, 1950 182 new State intended to affirm the rights of the subjects which they had against the merging State and to assume itself the liability if any arising against the merging State As the United State of Raja sthan into which the former State of Dholpur came to be merged in 1949 never recognised the obligations of the former State of Dholpur it was not bound to refund the amount due to the respondents We are of opinion that when the new State continued all the old laws till they were altered or repealed, and there was specific provision in each Covenant that the assets and liabilities of the Covenanting States were to be the assets and liabilities of the Union the new State must have intended to respect all the rights flowing from laws so continued and assume all liabilities arising from the existence of those laws 1 of 1949 the new State passed the Rajasthan Excise Duties Ordinance 1949 some time after
