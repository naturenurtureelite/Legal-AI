and corruption by public servant bribery and corruption by public Servant A public servant occupies office which renders him a public servant and 287 occupying Nor it was meant to afford protection to public servant from criminal prosecution for such offences First, the Judge must be a public servant When the prosecution proves that the public servant possesses assets disproportionate to his known sources of income the offence of criminal miscon duct is attributed to the public servant The public servant cannot be prosecuted for offences specified in the Section unless there is prior sanction for prosecution from the competent authority XXX XXX XXX 124 Therefore, when the offence is alleged to have been committed the accused was a public servant but by the time the court is called upon to take cognizance of the offence committed by him as public servant, he has ceased to be public servant, no sanction would be necessary for taking cognizance of the offence against him It is only to protect the honest public servants from frivolous and vexatious prosecution Section 5 of the Act creates offence of criminal misconduct on the part of a public servant to remove the public servant from that office and the nature of the office held by the public servant against whom sanction is sought which would indicate a hierarchy and which would therefore, permit inference of knowledge about the functions and duties of the office and its misuse or abuse by the public servant A Judge of the superior Court cannot therefore be excluded from the definition of public servant 6 in that a public servant is not to be exposed to harassment of a frivolous or speculative prosecution In our opinion, it is not necessary that the authority compe tent to give sanction for prosecution or the authority competent to remove the public servant should be vertically superior in the hierarchy in which the, office of the public servant exists Previous sanction necessary for prosecution The Act was intended to cover all categories of public servants 204 206) It is significant from the above extract in Antulay that for the purpose of grant of sanction under Section 6 of the Act to prosecute the public servant, a 'vertical hierarchy between the authority competent to remove the public servant from that office and the nature of the office held by the public servant against whom sanction is sought ' is clearly envisaged and, therefore, the authority competent to remove the public servant from that office should be vertically superior in the hierarchy in which the office exists having the competence to judge the, action of the public servant before removing the bar by granting sanction The discretion to prosecute public servant is taken away from the prosecuting agency and is vested in the authority which is competent to remove the public servant It indicates the authorities without whose sanction a public servant cannot be prosecut ed Parliament cannot therefore be the proper authority for granting sanction for the prosecution of a Judge It is the vertical hierarchy between the authority competent to remove the public servant from that office and the nature of the office held by the 289 public servant against whom sanction is sought which would indicate a hierarchy and which would therefore, permit inference of knowledge about the functions and duties of the office and its misuse or abuse by the public servant Section 21 of the IPC is not really defining "public servant" but enumerating the categories of public servants The purpose of grant of previ ous sanction before prosecuting a public servant ie But he cannot refuse to grant sanction if the material collected has made out 238 the commission of the offence alleged against the public servant 239 If there is no relationship of master and servant, as be tween public servant and the authority to appoint him, clause (c) has no application to the public servant Section 2 of the Prevention of Corruption Act interprets a public servant as meaning a public servant as defined in section 21 of the Indian Penal Code ie That is why the Legislature clearly provided that that authority alone would be competent to grant sanction which is entitled to remove the public servant against whom sanction is sought from the office" Where the office held by the public servant is not a part of vertical hierarchy in which there is an authority above the public servant, then, Section 6 can have no appli cation Section 6 applies only in cases where there is a vertical hierarchy of public offices and the public servants against whom sanction is sought from the sanctioning author ity But that is not the same thing to state that there is no offence till the public servant is able to account for the excess of assets The offence would be committed by the public servant by misusing or abusing the power of office and it is from that office, the author ity must be competent to remove him so as to be entitled to grant sanction It is only in taking of bribes or with regard to the offence of corruption the sanction for crimi nal prosecution is required It is said that Section 6 envisages that the authority competent to remove a public servant from the office should be vertically superior in the hierarchy in which the office exists It has enumerated as many as twelve categories of public servants It is for the public servant to prove the source of income or the means by which he acquired the assets That is why the Legislature clearly provided that that authority alone would be competent to grant sanction which is entitled to remove the public servant against whom sanction is sought from the office
" Thereafter it shall be presented to the President for removal of the Judge Each of the three clauses of subsection (1) of Section 6 uses the expression 'office ' and the power to grant sanction is conferred on the authority competent to remove the public servant from his office and Section 6 requires a sanction before taking cognizance of offences committed by public servant Admittedly, such previous sanction is a condition precedent for taking cognizance of an offence punishable under the Act, of a public servant who is prosecuted during his continuance in the office It seems to us that these observations were not intended to lay down the law that the authority competent to grant sanction for prosecution of public serv ant should be vertically superior in the hierarchy in which the office of the public servant exists Similarly the President appoints the Judges of the Supreme Court In other words, Section 6 applies only in cases where there is a vertical hierarchy of public offices and the public servant against whom sanction is sought is under the sanctioning authority in that hierarchy Therefore at the time of filing the FIR the appellant ceases to be a public servant and so no sanction under Sec It is for the Parliament to decide whether that stage has reached in the superior judiciary when legal sanction alone can be the remedy for maintenance of public confidence in the integrity of the superior judiciary without which independence of the judiciary would itself be in jeopardy to prevent corruption among public servants and to prevent harassment of the honest among them" The power to remove a Judge is vested in the two Houses of Parliament and the President Therefore, when the court is called upon to take cognizance of such offences, it must enquire whether there is a valid sanction to prosecute the public servant for the of fence alleged to have been committed by him as public servant It is not objectionable to initiate criminal proceedings against public servant before exhausting the disciplinary proceedings, and a fortiori, the prosecution of a JUdge for criminal misconduct before his removal by Parliament for proved misbehaviour is unobjectionable There are various protections afforded to Judges to preserve the independence of the judiciary There is no material to indicate that corruption in judiciary was a mischief to be cured when the Prevention of Corruption Act was enacted The President is not an outsider so far judiciary is concerned For the purposes of this Act, "public servant" means a public servant as defined in Section 21 of the Indian Penal Code
" All that is required is that the authority must be in a position to appreciate the material collected against the public servant to judge whether the prosecution contemplated is frivolous or speculative Under our enact ment the power has been conferred on the authority competent to remove the public servant First of all whether a Judge of the Supreme Court or a Judge of a High Court is a public servant within the meaning of Section 2 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 According to him the entire Section 6 seems to apply only to such public servants where there is relationship of master and servant between, them and their employer Without such an address by each of the House of the Parliament, the President is not empowered under the Constitution to order removal Of a Judge of the Supreme Court from his office Therefore, it unquestionably follows that the sanction to prosecute can be given by an authority competent to remove the public servant from the office which he has misused or abused because that authority alone would be able to know whether there has been a misuse or abuse of the office by the public servant and not some rank outsider In the present appeal the appellant ceases to be a public servant as h resigned from the office However, it is open to the public servant to satisfactorily account for such disproportionality of assets Thus, the definition of a public servant is very wide enough to include Judges of the Supreme Court as well as Judges of the High Court The authority competent to remove the public servant would be in a better position than the prosecuting agency to assess the material collected in a dispassionate and reasonable manner and determine whether sanction for prosecution of a public servant deserves to be granted or not Therefore, when a public servant is accused of an offence of taking gratification other then legal remuneration for doing or forebearing to do an official act (Section 161 (IPC) or as a public servant abets offences punishable under Sec tions 161 and 163 (Section 164 IPC) or as public servant obtains a valuable thing with out consideration from person concerned in any proceeding or business transacted by such public servant (Section 165 IPC) or commits criminal misconduct as defined in Section 5 of the 1947 Act, it is implicit in the various offences that the public servant has misused or abused the power of office held by him as public servant XXX XXX XXX 218 A charge of corruption against a superior Judge amounting to criminal misconduct by abuse of his office would certainly fail within the ambit of misbehaviour con templated under Article 124(5), since misbehaviour of a Judge in the form of corruption by abuse of his office would be an act of gross misbehaviour justifying his removal from office, irrespective of other legal sanction, if any, to punish a corrupt Judge This must be so when the judge commits a serious criminal offence and remains in office" That authority alone would be competent to judge whether on the facts alleged, there has been an abuse or misuse of office held by the public servant And this interrelation clearly provides a clue to the understanding of the provision in Section 6 providing for sanction by a competent authori ty who would be able to judge the action of the public servant before removing the bar, by granting sanction, to the taking of the cogni zance of offences by the court against the public servant The Preamble of the Act indicates that the Act was intended to prevent more effec tively the bribery and corruption by public servants XXX XXX XXX 5A XXX XXX XXX 4 But that is not the position in the case of removal of a Judge Presumption where public servant accepts gratification other than legal remu neration servants of their assets and liabilities determine the scope of the law The need for sanction under Section 6 for prosecution of the holder of a public office indicates the ambit and scope of the enactment for deciding whether the holder of a public office falls within the purview of the enactment XXX XXX XXX 361 It is true that the relationship of master and servant as is ordinarily understood in common law does not exist between the Judges of higher judiciary and the Government It was specifically denoted in the third category of public servant under Section 21 of IPC XXX XXX XXX 324 XXX XXX XXX 148 It cannot be imagined that the framers of the Constitution provided for removal of a supe rior Judge on lesser grounds of misbehaviour but nor for the gross misbehaviour of corruption No doubt, as held in Antulay, no sanction for prosecution under Section 6 is required after the public servant ceases to hold office, but it does not imply that every holder of a public office after ceasing to hold that office is within the purview of the enactment, even though during the tenure in office, only those public servants are 299 within its ambit in whose case sanction under Section 6 must be obtained If it is con templated to prosecute public servant who has committed such offences, when the court is called upon to take cognizance of the offence, a sanction ought to be available otherwise the court would have no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the offence Therefore a Judge of the High Court or of the Supreme Court comes within the defini tion of public servant and he is liable to be prosecuted under the provisions of 'the Prevention of Corruption Act The public servant defined under section 2 means a public serv ant as defined in Section 21 of the IPC In the case of such public servants whenever sanction to prosecute is sought under Section 6 of the Act, the competent authority can form the requisite opinion on the basis of the available material including the service record of the public servant to come to the conclusion whether the offence under clause (e) of possession of disproportionate assets which the public servant cannot satisfactorily account is made out prima facie A grant of sanction is not an idle formality but a solemn and sacrosanct act which removes the umbrella of protection of Government servants against frivolous prosecutions and the aforesaid requirements must therefore, be strictly complied with before any prosecution could be launched against public servants The order of the President is sine qua non for removal of a Judge In other words, if the holder of a public office during his tenure in office cannot be prosecuted without sanction under Section 6, then, as held in Antulay, no sanction for his prosecution after ceasing to hold the office may be necessary, but his prosecution is made because while in office he could be prosecuted With the previous sanction under Section 6 Though the definition of "public servant" under Section 21 of the Indian Penal Code may include a Judge of the Higher Judiciary, since the Judge is not 'employed in connection with the affairs of the Union or State ', the definition Should be narrowed down only to Judges other man the Judges of the Higher Judiciary The power to give sanction for prosecution can be con ferred on any authority If the Chief Justice of India himself is the person against whom the allegations of criminal misconduct are received the Government shall consult any other Judge or Judges of the Supreme Court It does not provide for prosecution of a Judge for offences under section 5(1)(e) of the Prevention of Corruption Act The Executive is competent to appoint the Judges but not empowered to remove them It will not have the consequence of removing the Judge from the office unless it is followed by an order of the President Bribery is a form of corruption It was urged that the public servant is entitled to an opportunity to explain the disproportionality between the assets and the known sources of income For the purposes of this Act, "public servant" means a public servant as defined in Section 21 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) The grant of previous sanction under Section 6 being a condition precedent for the prosecution of a public servant covered by the Act, it must follow that the holder of an office who may be a public servant according to the wide definition of the expression in the Act but whose category for the grant of sanction for prosecution is not envisaged by Section 6 of the Act, is outside the purview of the Act, not intended to be covered by the Act In order to launch a prosecution against a Judge either of the Supreme Court or of the High Court or the Chief Jus tice of the High Court previous sanction of the authority competent to remove a Judge from his office is mandatorily required Such authority may be of the de partment in which the public servant is working or an out side authority 122) XXX XXX XXX REPORT ON THE GOVERNMENT SERVANTS ' CONDUCT RULES XXX XXX XXX Rule 15 15 This conclusion is reinforced 'by the above extract from the Antulay decision, which speaks of the vertical hierarchy between the authority competent to remove the public servant and the nature of the office held by the public servant indicating that the removing authority should have the competence to take a decision on the material placed before it for the purpose of deciding whether the public servant against whom sanction is sought, has been prima facie guilty of abuse of his office so that there is occasion to bring about cessation of interrelation between the office and abuse by the holder of the office by his removal therefrom The Act is wholly workable in its existing form for the public servants within its purview and there is no impediment in its applicability to the large number of public servants who have been dealt with thereunder ever since its enactment Unless that ad dress is presented to the President in the same session for such removal, the President is not empowered under the Constitution to make the order for removal of the Judge of the Supreme Court of India or of the Judge of the High Court on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity In our country, the Judges of higher Judiciary are safe and secure The President, therefore, has the power to appoint as well as to remove a Judge from his office on the ground of 226 proved misbehaviour or incapacity as provided in Article 124 of the Constitution Secondly, the Chief Justice being the head of the judiciary is primarily concerned with the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary He must then proceed to record his own finding on the expla nation of the public servant Such, then, put quite shortly, were the contentions addressed to us on the authority competent to grant sanction for prosecution of Judges of the superior judiciary XXX XXX XXX SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS XXX XXX XXX 117 This opportunity should be given to the public servant by the Investigating Officer and the charge sheet must contain a statement to that effect, that is, to the unsatisfactory way of accounting by the public servant Criminal misconduct the office carries with it the powers conferred on the office The object underlying such provision Was to save the public servant from the harassment of frivolous or unsubstantiated allegations Undoubtedly the accused must be a public ' servant when he is alleged to have committed the offence of which he is accused because Sections 161, 164, 165 IPC and Sec 5(2) of the 1947 Act clearly spell out that the offences therein defined can be committed by a public servant A Judge of the Supreme Court as well as a Judge of the High Court is a constitutional functionary appointed under Article 124 and under Article 217 of the Constitution re spectively There is thus a fundamental distinction between the master and servant relationship between the Government and the Judges of High Courts and the Supreme Court
" The definition of 'public servant ' given in the Act includes 'every Judge ' Not to have a corrupt Judge or a Judge who has misbehaved is unquestionably in public inter est but at the same time preserving judicial independence is of the highest public inter est The need for these special provisions is a clear pointer in the direction of inapplicability to them of the general provisions applicable to the public servants holding other public offices, not as constitutional functionaries The President appoints the Judges of the High Courts and the Supreme Court in exercise of his executive powers The only mode of removal of a Judge from his office on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity is laid down in clauses (4) and (5) of Article 124 The Judge shall hold office until the age of super annuation subject to earlier removal for proved misbehaviour or incapacity During his tenure as the Judge and Chief Justice he was said to have acquired assets disproportionate to the known source of income Undoubtedly, respect for the judiciary and its public credibility and dignity has to be maintained in order to ensure respect for the Judges in public and also for the decisions rendered by the judges In order to adequately protect a Judge from frivolous prosecution and unnecessary harassment the President will consult the Chief Justice of India who will consider all the materials placed before him and tender his advice to the President for giving sanction to launch prosecution or for filing FIR against the Judge concerned after being satisfied in the matter Similarly in the case of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court the Presi dent shall consult such of the Judges of the Supreme Court as he may deem fit and proper and the President shall act in accordance with the advice given to him by the Judge or Judges of the Supreme Court The Judges are liable to be dealt with just the same way as any other person in respect of criminal offence Sec ond, there must be an authority competent to remove the Judge from his office 252 But we know of no law providing protection for Judges from Criminal prosecution The judiciary has no power of the purse or the sword That competent authority alone would know the nature and functions discharged by the public servant holding the office and whether the same has been abused or misused The process and power are 'both integrated in Parliament and Parliament alone is competent to remove a Judge Obviously, the competent sanctioning authority envisaged thereby is a vertical superior in the hierarchy having some power of superintendence over the functioning of the public servant It would follow that where the office held by the public servant is not a part of a verti cal hierarchy in which there is an authority above the public 'servant in that hierarchy, by the very scheme of Section 6 it can have no application and holder of such office who does not have any vertical superior above him in the absence of any such hierarchy cannot be within the ambit of the enactment, the Act not being envisaged or enacted for holder of such public office No such immunity from criminal prosecution has been provided for in the case of a Judge of the High Court or of the Supreme Court If the chief Justices of opinion that it is not a fit case for grant of sanction for prosecution of the Judge concerned the Presi dent shall not accord sanction to prosecute the Judge;This will save the Judge concerned from unnecessary harassment as weal as from frivolous prosecution against him as suggested by my learned brother Shetty, J in his judgment Maybe, need is now felt for a law providing for trial and punishment of a superior Judge who is charged with the criminal misconduct of corruption by abuse of his office Nobody can deny this basic essence of independence of judiciary The removal would bring about cessation of interrelation between the office and abuse by the holder of the office The Section goes further in clause (c) to cover the remaining categories of public servants Section 6 is primarily concerned to see that prosecution for the specified offences shall not commence without the sanction of a competent authority If he has ceased to be a public servant in the meantime, this vital considera tion ceases to exist
" Nor even the sheer excess of assets over income, but the inability of the public servant in not being able to satisfactorily account for the excess Of course, the power of the President to remove a Judge of the Supreme Court or of the High Court is to be 219 exercised by the President in the manner expressly laid down in clause 4 of Article 124 XXX XXX XXX 280 211 In this view, the President can be considered as the authority to grant sanc tion for prosecution of a Judge since the order of the President for the removal of a Judge is mandatory, The motion passed by each House of Parliament with the special procedure prescribed under clause (4) of Article 124 will not proprio vigore operate against the judge XXX XXX XXX (4) A Judge of the Supreme Court shall not be removed from his office except by an order of the President passed after an address by each House of Parliament supported by a majority of the total membership of the House and by a majority of not less than two thirds of the members of that House present and voting has been presented to the President in the same session for such removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity The President shall act in accordance with advice given by the Chief Justice of India If the Chief Justice of India Therefore, it is clear that a Judge will be liable for committing criminal misconduct within the meaning of clause (e) of sub section (1) of section 5 of the said Act if he has in his possession pecuniary resources or property dis proportionate to his known sources of income for which the public servant (or a Judge as the public servant) cannot satisfactorily account The importance of an order of the President for removal of a Judge could be seen by contrasting the provisions of clause (4) of Article 124 with the provisions for removal of the President, VicePresident and Speaker But a Judge must keep himself absolutely above suspicion" to preserve the impartiality and independence of the judiciary The ambit of the enactment is to be determined on the basis of the public office held by the public serv ant, which office is alleged to have been abused during the tenure for committing the offence of criminal misconduct under the Act and it is not the fact of continuance in that office or ceasing to hold it which decides the ambit of the enactment Section 6 providing for prior sanction from the competent authority and directing that no court shall take cognizance of the offence under Section 5(1) without such prior sanction is indeed a protection for Judges from frivolous and malicious prosecution So to initiate a proceeding against a Judge of a Supreme Court for criminal misconduct failing under Section 5(1)(e), previous sanction of the authority who is competent to remove a Judge including Chief Justice of the High Court from his office, is imperative Each category is different from other and there is hardly any relationship of master and servant in some of the categories When section 5(1)(e) uses the words "for which the public servant is unable to satisfactorily account", it is implied that the burden is on such public servant to ac count for the sources for the acquisition of disproportionate assets According to Article 124(4), a Judge can be removed from his office by an order of the President passed after an address by each House of Parliament supported by the pre scribed majority on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity The fact remains that while according sanction to prosecute under Section 6 of the Act, the competent authority has to satisfy itself about the public servant 's inability to satisfactorily account for possession of dis proportionate assets The provisions broadly include the existing offences under sections 161 and 165 of the Indian Penal Code committed by public servants and enact a new rule of presumptive evidence against the accused Bansi vs State of Maharashtra), ; Existence thus of a valid sanction is a pre requisite to the taking of cognizance of the enumerated offences alleged to have been committed by a public servant The competent authority may refuse sanction for prosecution if the offence alleged has no material to support or it is frivolous or intended to harass the honest officer Where there is relationship of master and servant the master would be in commanding position The authority competent to give prior sanction for prosecution of such persons would be the State Government It is farthest from our mind that a Judge of the Supreme Court or that of the High Court will be immune from prosecu tion for criminal offences committed during the tenure of his office under the provisions of the Prevention of Corrup tion Act It was also suggested at the hearing that the absence of need of sanction for prosecution under Section 6 of the Act after the public servant ceases to hold office as held in Antulay, suggests answer to the question of construction posed in this case Prescribing the substantive offence by insertion of clause (e) as a part of the same schem 297 of amendment also suggests the manner in which this require ment of the offence of inability to satisfactorily account can be examined by the competent authority while granting sanction to prosecute the public servant They are liable to be removed for proved misbehaviour or incapacity Clause (4) of Article 124 mandates that "a Judge shall not be removed from his office except by an order of the President passed after an address by each House of Parliament  " 6 and similar sections, is that there should not be unneces sary harassment of public servant (CR This is so because what must ultimately sustain the court in public confidence is the character and independence of the judges  Clause (c) states that in the case of any other person the sanction would be of the authority competent to remove him from his office The Act also creates a new offence of criminal misconduct by public servants though to some extent it overlaps on the pre existing offences and enacts a rebuttable presumption contrary to the well known principles of Criminal Juris prudence Conversely, if the holder of a public office while continuing in that office could not be prosecuted under this Act on account of inapplicability of Section 6 and, therefore, the non feasibility of previous sanction for prosecution under Section 6, then on his ceas ing to hold the office, he is not brought within the purview of the Act merely because Antulay decides that no sanction for prosecution under Section 6 is 'needed after the holder of a public office ceases to hold that office The Judge of the Supreme Court or the Judge of the High Court is appointed under the provisions of Article 124 or under the provisions of Article 217 respec 222 tively As held in Antulay, the competent authority before granting sanction has to apply its mind and be satisfied about the existence of a prima facie case for prosecution of the public servant on the basis of the mate rial placed before it It was sug gested that some machinery involving the Chief Justice of India for grant of sanction for prosecution by the President of India, even for investigation into the offence, could be suggested by this Court for implicit compliance by the executive It is argued that if the grant of sanction under Section 6 of the Act for prosecution of the incumbent for the offence is not feasible or envisaged, the clear indica tion is that holder of such office does not fall within the purview of the Act It was also pointed out that the object served in this manner was the greater public interest to preserve independence of judiciary and not to protect the corrupt Judge who was an exception In other words, the President cannot on its own remove a Judge of the Supreme Court unless an address by each House of Parliament supported by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than two thirds of the members of that House present and voting, is passed and presented to him for removal of the Judge on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity Antulay; , before a Constitution Bench of this Court where it has been observed: "Section 6 bars the Court from taking cogni zance of the offences therein enumerated alleged to have been committed by a public servant except with the previous sanction of the competent authority empowered to grant the requisite sanction  Antulay, , which is as under: "Offences prescribed in Sections 161, 164 and 165 IPC and Section 5 of the 1947 Act have an intimate and inseparable relation with the office of a public servant His first contention is that the Judges of the High Courts and the Supreme Court are not within the purview of the Act, which is a special enactment applicable to public servants, in whose case prosecution can be launched after sanction granted under Section 6 of the Act, which is alien to the scheme envisaged for constitu tional functionaries like Judges of the High Courts and Supreme Court Counsel for the appellant however, submitted that there is no law prohibiting a public servant having in his posses sion assets disproportionate to his known sources of income and such possession becomes an offence of criminal miscon duct only when the accused is unable to account for it Great reliance has been placed on Section 6, requiring previous sanction of the authority competent to remove the Judge ' from the office as a necessary condition for taking cognizance As to the ingredients of the offence, learned Judge contin ued: "The ingredients of the offence of criminal misconduct under section 5(2) read with section 5(1)(e) are the possession of pecuniary resources or property disproportionate to the known sources of income for which the public servant cannot satisfactorily account There seems to be another reason for taking away the discretion of the investigating agency to prosecute or not to prosecute a public servant The bar is to the taking of cognizance of offence by the court office as the Chief Justice of Madras gradually commenced accumulation of disproportionate assets etc The Executive may misuse the power by interfering with the judiciary But that is no ground for withholding criminal prosecution till the Judge is removed by Parliament as suggested by counsel for the appellant Clause (e) creates a statutory offence which must be proved by the prosecution It has been urged by the Solicitor General as well as the Additional Solicitor General that the Judges of the High Court cannot be said to be exempted from prosecution in respect of offences provided in the Prevention of Corruption Act In exercise of the power vested under clause (5) of Article 124, the Parliament has passed the prescribing the procedure for presentation of an address and for the investigation and proof of misbehaviour or incapacity of a Judge Sub article 4 of the said article 124 further enjoins that a Judge of the Supreme Court shall not be removed from his office except by an order of the President passed after an address by each House of Parliament supported by a majority of the total member ship of that House and by a majority of not less than two thirds of the members of that House present and voting has 218 been presented to the President in the same session for such removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity Clause (2) of Article 124 provides that every Judge of the Supreme Court shah be appointed by the Presi dent in consultation with such of the Judges of the supreme Court and of the High Courts as the President may deem necessary for the purpose and in case of appointment of a Judge other than the Chief Justice, the Chief Justice of/India shall always be consulted (2) Where for any reason whatsoever any doubt arises whether the previous sanction as re quired under sub section (1) should be given by the Central or State Government or any other authority, such sanction shall be given by that Government or authority which would have been competent to remove the public servant from his office at the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed The other authority cannot be involved to grant sanction for prosecu tion of a Judge since it would be inconsistent with the provisions of the Act and the Constitutional requirements From the very com mencement of the IPC "Every Judge" finds a place in the categories of "public servant" defined under Section 21 of IPC It was argued that in this manner preservation of independence of the judiciary could be ensured while treat ing the superior Judges also within the purview of the Act to enable the prosecution and punishment of the corrupt ones That address praying for removal of the Judge must be adopted by each House of Parliament in accordance with the provisions of clause (4) of Article 124 It also aims to protect honest public servants from harassment by prescribing that the investigation against them could be made only by police officials of particular status and by making the sanction of the Government or other appropriate officer a pre condition for their prosecution P C against Judge of the High Court, Chief Justice of High Court or Judge of the Supreme Court unless the Chief Justice of India is consulted in the matter There is no escape from the conclusion that the gross misbehaviour of corruption of a Judge must undoubtedly fall within the ambit or Article 124(5) justifying his removal in the manner provided in Article 124(4) The investigating officer is not holding an enquiry against the conduct of the public servant or deter mining the disputed issues regarding the disproportionality between the assets and the income of the accused Can the Chief Justice of a High Court or any of its puisne Judges be prosecuted for an offence punishable under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act ')? Any provision which cannot apply to the Chief Justice of India, cannot obviously apply to the Judges of the Supreme Court, or for that matter even to the High Court Judges, since the Chief Justice of India is not a vertical superior of any of them, there being no such vertical hierarchy and the Chief Justice of India having no power of superintendence even over the High Court Judges, much less the Supreme Court Judges: The incumbent of the office of Chief Justice of India exercises only moral authority over his colleagues in the Supreme Court and the High Court Judges, which has no legal sanction behind it making it justiciable The High Court has expressed the view that no sanction for prosecution of the appellant under Section 6 was necessary since he has retired from the serv ice on attaining the age of superannuation and was not a public servant on the date of filing the chargesheet The fact that the Parliament did not enact any other law even then for the investigation into allegations of corruption against a superior Judge and for his trial and punishment for that offence and rest content merely with enacting the , to provide for the procedure for remov al of a Judge under Article 124(4) is a clear pointer in the direction that the Parliament has not as yet considered it expedient to enact any such law for the trial and punishment on the charge of corruption of a superior Judge, except by his removal from office in the manner prescribed 250 In the event of President regarded as the authority competent to give prior sanction for the prosecution of a Judge, counsel for the appellant contended, that the Presi dent cannot act independently The Judge as a con stitutional functionary being appointed by the President can only be removed by mandatory procedure provided under Arti cle 124 of the Constitution and in no other manner The question is as to whether there is some "authority competent" to remove a High Court Judge from his office or not The Chief Justice of India is a participatory functionary in the 254 matter of appointment of Judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts There is no instance of the removal of a judge by this method since the Act of Settlement Shri Sibal argued that irrespective of the desirability of enacting a law providing for the prosecution and trial of superior Judges accused of the offence of criminal misconduct, the existing law contained in the Act is inapplicable to them There is no criminal sanction which is specifical ly applicable only to judicial behaviour; rather, the judges are included in those criminal provisions which apply gener ally to public servants, such as provisions concerning corruption, omission or refusal to perform activities of office, vexation, etc
" It was represented to the Committee by the public that corruption has increased to such an extent that people have started losing faith in the integrity of public administration (1)  
XXX XXX XXX (4) A Judge of the Supreme Court shall not be removed from his office except by an order of the President passed after an address by each House of Parliament supported by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than two thirds of the members of that House present and voting has been presented to the President in the same session for such removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity The said Act and the Rules made thereunder only provide for removal of a Judge on the ground of proved misbehaviour or inability The President has not been given the sole power or the exclusive power to remove a Judge either of the Supreme Court or of the High Court from his office though the Presi dent appoints the Judge by warrant under his hand and seal after consultation with such of the Judges of the Supreme Court and of the High Court in the States as he may deem necessary for that purpose and in case of the appointment of the Judge of the High Court, the President appoints a Judge by warrant under his hand and seal after consultation with the Chief Justice of India, the Governor of the State and in a case of appointment of a Judge other than the Chief Jus tice, the Chief Justice of the High Court The concept of sanction for prosecution by a superior is so inextricably woven into the fabric of the enactment that the pattern is incomplete without it While analysing ingredients of the offence, he went on to state that the gist of the offence is not the possession of assets merely The provision for sanction is like the keystone in the arch of the enactment The decisions of this Court have unequivocally held that a Judge or Chief Justice of a High Court is a constitutional functionary, even though he holds a public office and in that sense, may be included in the wide definition of 'public servant ' Any complaint against a Judge and its investigation by the CBI, if given publicity will have a far reaching impact on the Judge and the litigant public On the last aspect relating to the requirement of prior sanction for prosecution of the appellant, the learned Judge, held that since the appellant has retired from serv ice and was no longer a 'public servant ' on the date of filing the charge sheet, the sanction for his prosecution required under Section 6 of the Act is not warranted The Act is not basically defective in its application to judiciary This appears to be the obvious conclusion even for a case like the present where no such sanction for prosecution is necessary on the view taken in Antulay, and not chal lenged before us, that the sanction for prosecution under Section 6 is not necessary when cognizance of the offence is taken after the accused has ceased to hold the office in question The expression 'office ' in the three sub clauses of Section 6(1) would clear ly denote that office which the public servant misused or abused for corrupt motives for which he is to be prosecuted and in respect of which a sanction to prosecute him is necessary by the competent authority 288 entitled to remove him from that office which he has abused Article 61 pro vides procedure for removal of the President of India We may make it clear that if a Judge is convicted for the offence of criminal misconduct or any other offence involving moral turpitude, it is but proper for him to keep himself away from the Court This will seriously jeopardise the independence of judiciary which is undoubtedly a basic feature of the Constitution The link between power with oppor tunity to abuse and the holder of office would be severed by removal from office The Committee collected a lot of material from the public relating to the nature of corruption in the administration A Judge of the Supreme Court shall be appointed by the President by the warrant under his hand and seal after consultation with such Judges of the Supreme Court and of the High Court in the State as the President may deem neces sary for the purpose and shall hold office until he attains the age of 65 years Protection of President and Governors and Rajpramukhs The expression "Every Judge" used in the third category of Section 21 indicates all Judges and all Judges of all Courts They argued that there is no immunity to the superior Judges as in the case of the President and the Governor under Article 36 1 of the Constitution and, therefore, there was no reason to exclude to superior Judges from the purview of the Act It was, however, contended that for the purpose of deciding the question of applicability of the Act to the appellant as a Judge or Chief Justice of the High Court, the office with reference to which the offence under the Act is alleged to have been committed, it is necessary to consider the feasibility of grant of sanction under Section 6 of the Act for prosecution of a person holding such an office He argued that that term means that the public servant is entitled to an opportunity before the Investigating Officer to explain the alleged dispropor tionality between assets and the known sources of income The third most crucial question that fails for consider ation in this case is who is the competent authority to remove a Judge either of the, Supreme Court or of the High Court from his office in order to enable that authority to grant sanction for prosecution of the Judge under the provi sions as enjoined by Section 6 of the Prevention of Corrup tion Act, 1947 The framers of the Constitution had visualised that the constitutional scheme for appointment of the superior Judges would ensure that by an honest exercise performed by all the constitutional functionaries of their obligation in the process of appointment of a superior Judge, there would be no occasion to try and punish any appointee to such a high office for an act of corruption Sub article 2 of Article 124 further provides that every Judge of the Supreme Court shall be appointed by the President by warrant under his hand and seal after consultation with such of the Judges of the Supreme Court and of the High Courts in the States as the President may deem necessary for the purpose and shall hold office until he attains the age of sixty five years The High Court Judge retires at 62, while the Supreme Court Judge retires at 65 lqbal Ahmad vs State of AP, ; ; Legislature advisedly conferred power on the authority competent to remove the public servant from the office to grant sanction for the obvious reason that that authority alone would be able, when facts and evidence are placed before him, to judge whether a serious offence is committed or the prosecution is either frivolous or specula tive On a plain reading of the provisions of sub article 4 of Article 124, a Judge of the Supreme Court can only be re moved on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity by an order of the President passed after an address by each House of Parliament supported by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than two thirds of the members of that House present and voting, has been presented to the President in the same session for such removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or inca pacity The central issue is whether the Judges could be prosecuted for offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 ( 'the Act ') No discussion shall take place in Parliament with respect to the conduct of any Judge of the Supreme Court or of a High Court in the discharge of his duties except upon a motion for presenting an address to the President praying for the removal of the Judge as hereinafter provided 1976, while the appellant was a public servant, he was in possession of pecuniary resources and property in his own name and in the names of his wife Smt The difficulty of sanction under Section 6 for the prosecution of superior Judges and the special provisions contained in clauses (4) and (5) of Article 124 read with Article 2 18, it was suggested, pre sented no difficulty since the President of India could be treated as the competent authority to grant sanction in accordance The power is located under Article 124 of the Constitution (2) Where for any reason whatsoever any doubt arises whether the previous sanction as required under subsection (1) should be given by the Central or State Government or any other authority, such sanction shall be given by that Government or authority which would have been com 279 petent to remove the public servant from his office at the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed
" Clauses (a) and (b) would thus cover the cases of public servants who are employed in connection with the affairs of the Union or State and are not removable from their office save by or with the sanction of the Central Government or the State Government The expression "public servant" used in the Preven tion of Corruption Act, 1947 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Act ') is undoubtedly wide enough to denote every judge, including Judges of the High Court and the Supreme Court Indeed he is duty bound to grant sanction if the material collected lend credence to the offence complained of It is, therefore, necessary to evolve some method commensurate with the grant of sanction in cases of serious allegation corruption and acquisition or the posses sion of disproportionate assets which the Judge cannot satisfactorily account for 'or possession of property dispro portionate to the sources of income of the Judge It is has been eloquently and vehemently urged on behalf of the appellant that since the Judge of the Supreme Court as well as of the High Court is a constitu tional functionary and 223 there is no employer and employee relationship or master and servant relationship between the Judge and the President of India and for that the Central Government or the State Government there is no authority to remove the Judge from 'his office by the executive except by taking recourse to procedure of impeachment as envisaged in Article 124(4) and (5) of the Constitution of India Mr Justice Shetty has held that since ultimately it is the order of the President which is necessary for the removal of a Judge, he must be treated to be the competent authority But Parliament, coun sel contended, cannot be the sanctioning authority for the prosecution of a Judge This protection to Judges will be defeated if they are compelled to stand trial for offence committed while discharging duties of their office even before retire ment The next question is whether a judge of the Supreme Court or a Judge of High Court including the Chief Justice of the High Court can be prosecuted for having committed the offence of criminal misconduct as referred to in clause (e) of sub section 1 of section 5 of the Prevention of Corrup tion Act, 1947 So far offences punishable under Sections 161, 164 and 165 of the Indian Penal Code are concerned they are also subject to such previous sanction account for his possession of disproportionate assets vs President of India and Ors Antulay, at 206: "That competent authority alone would know the nature and function discharged by the public servant holding the office and whether the same has been abused or misused It has been, therefore, urged that Section 6(i)(C) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 is not applicable to the case of a Judge of the Supreme Court or of the High Court No prosecution can be launched against a Judge of the Supreme Court or of the High Court under the provisions of the said Act except in the mode envisaged in Article 124, clauses 4 and 5 of the Constitution for removal of the Judge It also provides that in the case of appointment of a Judge other than the Chief Justice, the Chief Justice of India shall always be consulted In order to properly discharge this burden cast by the section, it Would be necessary for the Investigating Officer first of all to call upon the public servant to account for the disproportionate assets Clause (a) of Section 6(1) covers public servants employed in connection with the affairs of the Union Thus, even for the procedure for investigation into any misbehaviour of a Judge as well as its proof, a law enacted by the Parliament under Article 124(5) is envisaged in the constitutional scheme There shall be similar consul tation at the stage of examining the question of granting sanction for prosecution and it shall be necessary and appropriate that the question of sanction be guided by and in accordance with the advice of the Chief Justice of India Section 2 of the Act adopts the definition of "public servant" as given in Section 21 of the Indian Penal Code, which includes "Every Judge" Article 217 provides that every Judge of a High Court shall be appointed by the President by warrant under his hand and seal after consultation with the Chief Justice of India, the Governor of the State, and in the case of appointment of a Judge other than the Chief justice, the Chief Justice of the High Court It appears that the framers of the Constitution, while dealing with such constitutional functionaries, contemplated merely their removal from office in the manner provided in Article 124(4) as the only punishment; and a special law enacted by the Parliament under Article 124(5), even for investigation and proof of any misbehaviour alleged against a superior Judge instead of the general law was clearly visualised when the alleged misbehaviour is connected with his office He pointed out that the order of the President for removal of a Judge is imperative under clause (4) of Article 124 of the Constitution and the President could be the proper authority under clause (c) of Section 6(1) of the Act Clause (1) of Article 217 provides that every Judge of the High Court shall be appointed by the President after consultation with the Chief Justice of India, the Governor of the State, and in the case of appointment of a Judge Other than the Chief Justice, the Chief Justice of the High Court That does not mean that the Act was intended to condone the offence of bribery Protection to the public servant in general is provided under Article 311 and the interest of the subordi nate judiciary is further taken care of by the High Court, and this along with the provisions regarding previous sanc tion shields them from unjustified prosecution The question of grant of sanction under Section 6 for the prosecution of a Judge or Chief Justice of a High Court for an offence punishable under Section 5(2) of the Act is, therefore, of considerable importance to decide the main question in this appeal On this basis, it was argued that the procedure for grant of sanction under Sec tion 6 of the Act which requires the sanctioning authority to see the explanation of the public servant before granting sanction, makes it feasible, which also shows its inapplica bility to the superior Judges, in whose case there is no such service record or machinery provided This is more so, since the rejection of such an argument would not in any manner jeopardise the provisions of the Act as it would result only in the failure of the attempt to bring the constitutional functionaries such as Judges of the High Courts and the Supreme Court within the purview of that Act, while the Act would continue to apply to the public servants in general who fall within the scheme of Section 6 of the Act for the purpose of grant of previous sanction for prosecution which is a condition precedent for cognizance of an offence pun ishable under that Act The has been enacted by Parliament to regulate 224 the procedure for the investigation and proof of the misbe haviour or incapacity of a Judge of the Supreme Court under clause (5) of subsection 1 of Article 124 of the Constitu tion The Court shall avoid interpretation which is likely to impair the independence of the judiciary The Judge is made total ly independent of the control and influence of the executive by mandatorily embodying in article 124 or article 217 that a Judge can only be removed from his office in the manner provided in clause (4) and (5) of article 124 The same view about the independence of the judiciary from the con 220 trol of the executive has been spelt out by the observations of the Constitution Bench of Seven Judges in the case of SP Section 6(1)(c) specifically enjoins that no court shall take cognizance of an offence punishable under Section 5 of this Act, alleged to have been committed by a public servant ie
