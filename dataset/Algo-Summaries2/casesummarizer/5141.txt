Though the permits to be granted are for tourist vehicles, the preference is confined to operators of tourist cars and travel agents One may understand a preference granted to operators of tourist vehicles but it is difficult to understand why preference should be given to operators of tourist cars in the matter of granting permits for tourist vehicles which may well be omnibuses required to travel long distances There is no question of eliminating private operators merely because the Undertaking applies for a stage carriage permit under Chapter IV Section 42 prescribes permits for the use of a transport vehicle in any public place In the first place, clause (d), it is seen, provides for a preference, not to operators of tourist vehicles but to operators of tourist cars and travel agents Surely it cannot be said that experience of running a tourist taxi is a better qualification than running a tourist bus when the question of granting permits for tourist vehicles arises When the Undertaking applies for permit under Chapter IV, it must satisfy the Regional Transport Authority that it is better suited than the private operator to render transport facility to the travelling public Section 47(1 H) also enunciates a rules of preference and says that an application for stage carriage permit from State Transport Undertaking for operating in any inter State route shall be given preference overall other applications When an application for a stage carriage permit is being processed as required by sec Section 68 F(1) prescribes that where, in pursuance of an approved scheme, a State Transport Undertaking applies for a stage carriage permit, a contract carriage permit or a public carrier 's permit in respect of a notified area or notified route, such permit shall be granted to the State Transport Undertaking by the State Transport Authority in a case where the said area or route lies in more than one region and the Regional Transport Authority in any other case The State Transport Authority, by its proceedings dated April 30, 1984, granted 11 out of the 14 permits to the Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation, one permit to the Indian Tourism Development Corporation and two permits to the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation Vaidyanathan, learned counsel for the 'Preferred ' Operators has placed before us 'a Scheme for granting approval to tourist transport operators in India ' Sections 46, 47 and 48 deal with the grant of stage carriage permits A number of appeals were preferred to the Karnataka State Transport Appellate Tribunal 47(1 H) however, provides that in the case of inter State route, the Undertaking will have preference in the matter of stage carriage permit The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation, the Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation and some other private operators have filed these appeals by special leave of this Court under article 136 of the Constitution The proviso to section 47(1) prescribes that, other things being equal, a registered cooperative society and a person possessing a licence for driving transport vehicles shall be given preference over individual owners in granting stage carriage permits The High Court of Karnataka tided over the difficulty by interpreting the expression "tourist cars" as meaning "tourist vehicles" The Tribunal by its order dated February 28, 1985 set aside the grant of the two permits in favour of the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation, set aside the grant of three out of eleven permits to the Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation and instead granted three permits to private operators and increased the number of permits granted to the Indian Tourism Development Corporation from one to three While a tourist vehicle may include a motor car, a motor car, by definition, excludes an omnibus In an application under Chapter IV, Corporation has to enter the arena like any other applicant, face the competition and come up to the level of other private operators intending to obtain stage carriage permits and then in respect of the route in question claim preference 47, the application of the Undertaking for an inter State route shall be examined as application of any other private operator It was on that ground that the grant of two permits to the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation was set aside, though the Appellate Tribunal had no doubt regarding the resources and ability of that corporation to operate the tourist services In exercise of its powers under section 63(7) of the , the Central Government specified 50 as the number of 'All India Tourist Vehicle Permits ' which may be granted by the Karnataka State Transport Authority Section 63(1) stipulates, broadly, that a permit granted by the Regional Transport Authority of any one region shall not be valid in any other region, unless the permit has been countersigned by the Regional Transport Authority of that other region, and a permit granted in any one State shall not be valid in any other State unless countersigned by the State Transport Authority of 1014 that other State or by the Regional Transport Authority concerned By the time the proviso came into force, 36 permits had been granted by the Karnataka State Transport Authority and 14 remained to be granted Chapter IV, sections 42 to 68, deals with "Control of Transport vehicles" The rule is a rule of preference and not a rule of exclusion
