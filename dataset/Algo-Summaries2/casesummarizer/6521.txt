The fair rent fixed by the Rent Controller at Rs994 pm was upheld It is the quantum of fair rent that arises for deter mination by the Rent Controller In view of this the Rent Controller dismissed HRC The order of the Rent Controller was dated 93 The rent for the premises was Rs The necessary condition for exercise of jurisdiction by the Rent Controller is the existence of relationship of landlord and tenant The rent authorities have no power to decide a dispute which is not between a landlord and tenant 1 as against the rent of Rs The jurisdiction of the Rent Controller, (xxx) is a statutory jurisdiction which is vested in the Rent Controller by the terms of the Act it self If the civil court in this case had come to the conclusion that there is a relationship of a landlord and a tenant and that the LIC was entitled to recover the rent from the tenants, it will have to pass a decree in favour of the LIC on the basis of the fair rent fixed by the Rent Controller He has no doubt to ensure that the person applying for the fair rent is the tenant or the landlord Where a fair rent is fixed by a Controller, the Rent Control Act does not provide for a machinery for recovery of the amount 1 of the property set out in Schedule A to the plaint based on the difference between the fair rent fixed by the Rent Controller and the rent payable therefore under exhibit P 1 2557/64), it had been held by the Rent Controller that item No So also, in an application under section 4, the jurisdiction of the Rent Controller is to determine a fair or standard rent for the premises The Rent Controller was, therefore, held to have had juris diction to fix the fair rent in respect of the premises was the landlord or they the tenants in respect of the property There is no doubt that, since an application for this purpose cannot lie except at the instance of a landlord or a tenant, the Rent Controller has to deal with this incidentally but this is not one of the direct issues before the Rent Controller All that the Rent Controller has to do is to satisfy himself that the person seeking eviction or fixation of fair rent is a "landlord" who has, prima facie, ' the right to receive the rents of the property in question In view of this finding, it was held that the Rent Controller had no jurisdiction to entertain the application for fixation of fair rent in respect of the property which was only a vacant piece of land The order of the Rent Controller in respect of item 2 was also upheld In that case, the tenant filed a petition under the relevant Rent Control Act for permission to deposit rents in court The Rent Controller accepted the above argument so far as item was concerned In conse quence, it was held, the LIC could not maintain the suit for recovery of rent based on the order made by the statutory tribunal under the Rent Control Act and claim the difference between the so called fair rent and the contract rent They claimed, there fore, that they were entitled to relief under the Madras 550 City Tenants ' Protection Act and that the Rent Controller Court had no jurisdiction to fix a fair rent 867/1963 in respect of these two buildings for fixation of fair rent If, and only if, this relationship exists between the parties, the Rent Controller steps in for a limited purpose to determine what the fair rent is and then fades out of the picture 3311/65, fixed the fair rent in respect of item No It will not be open to the civil court to re determine the rent payable by the tenant to the landlord because that is a matter squarely and exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Rent Controller and, therefore, impliedly excluded from the purview of the civil court In order to decide whether the denial of the landlord 's title by the tenant is bona fide, the Rent Controller may have to go into the tenant 's contentions on the issue but he is not to decide the question finally The rent as per lease deed was Rs200 per month Thereafter the tenant filed a suit for a declaration that the order of the Rent Controller was ultra vires in that no notice to quit had been given as required by law The peti tion for fixation of fair rent was dismissed by the learned First Additional Rent Controller on the ground that the lease has been taken under two separate deeds and that a single petition was not maintainable In our opinion, on a proper construction of the Rent Control Act, the question on which the jurisdiction of the civil court is excluded is only the determination as to the fair rent of the premises In a proceedings under the Act, whether it be for fixation of fair rent or eviction, the tenant may raise several objections The landlady denied any relationship of tenant and landlord between the applicant and herself In a suit by a landlord against his tenant for eviction, the determination of the tenancy is merely one of the constituents of the cause of action that the landlord has to prove against his tenant in order to succeed in the suit He has also no doubt to satisfy himself as to the extent of the premises qua which the relationship of landlord and tenant exists and in respect of which rent is receivable or payable In order to give that relief, the Rent Control Court must first have jurisdiction as it can adjudi cate disputes only between a landlord and a tenant The Division Bench observed: "  
We agree with the learned Judge that this Court can entertain a suit to set aside an order of the Rent Controller if the Rent Controller exceeded the powers con ferred on him 64/1969 on the original side of the Madras High Court against the tenants for recovery of arrears of rent on the basis of the fair rents fixed, which were computed at Rs98,25097 in respect of the two items of property But, we think, Sri Parasaran is right in saying that, since the Rent Controller has no jurisdiction to entertain an application except by a landlord or a tenant, the ques tion of title to the property is one on which his very jurisdiction depends The fair rent claimed was computed at Rs2,39903 per month in respect of item No There are clear indications in the Act and rules that the Rent Con troller does not have the jurisdiction to decide questions of title The rent authorities cannot grant the reliefs of declaration of occupancy rights 87 of 72 by a common judgment dated 23101972), the contention urged on behalf of the tenants was that, since the subject matter of the lease under exhibit P 1 was only a vacant site, the Rent Controller had no juris diction to fix the fair rent in respect thereof and that, therefore, the claim in the suit for arrears of rent, based on the Rent Controller 's order in respect of the premises covered by exhibit P 1 had to fail Since the relationship is denied by the landlord, the Rent Con troller had decided that question incidentally In respect of item 2 the fair rent claimed was Rs326650 as against Rs200 pm payable under the lease deed It is important to remember that when an owner files a suit for arrears of rent, it is open to the tenant, under the general law, to plead that no rent is payable in respect of the premises as, indeed, it belongs to him It may be mentioned here that, even in certain earlier proceedings for fixation of fair rent and eviction (HRC After putting up the buildings, he applied for determination of standard rent under the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947 The tenants filed an appeal being OSA 551, was that the Rent Control Act would apply even in cases where the landlord had leased out only a vacant site and the tenant had put up his own construction thereon Section 4 of the Rent Control Act, as already pointed out, provides only a machin ery for fixation of fair rent in respect of certain prem ises had not claimed at any stage any rent in respect of the superstructures (apart from the contractual rent, which was in respect of the land) and that both parties have all along been proceeding on the footing that the superstructure on item 1 belonged to the lessees When a petition under section 4 is filed, the Rent Controller, on the language of section 4 has to decide: (1) whether the applicant is a tenant in, or landlord of, the building and (2) what the fair rent of the premises should be in accordance with the provisions of the Act That the Rent Controller 's jurisdic tion on this issue is limited is clear from the proviso to section 10(1) of the Act The Court observed: "The main relief sought for bythe tenants was for deposit ing the rents on the ground that the landlord refused to receive the same In that petition the tenant disputed the title of the Corporation in respect of the buildings
