The same day Sankaran protested against his suspension and requested that in any case the departmental inquiry should be expedited One Sankaran was in the employ of the appellant as a crosscutter On July 8, 1958, the appellant terminated the services of Sankaran under r 18 (a) of the Standing Orders without holding any departmental inquiry and the order was communicated to Sankaran the same day On June 25, 1958 Sankaran was informed that in view of his denial, a departmental inquiry would be held and he was also placed under suspension pending inquiry As no inquiry was held till July 2, 1958, Sankaran again wrote to the appellant to hold the inquiry as early as possible In the result the order of discharge was set aside and Sankaran was ordered to be reinstated A dispute was then raised by the union which was referred to the industrial tribunal for adjudication by the Government of Kerala in October 1958 We have already said that this position cannot be accepted in industrial adjudication relating to termination of service of an employee and has not been accepted by industrial tribunals over a long course of years now and the view taken by industrial tribunals has been upheld by this Court in the two cases referred to above But the tribunal has pointed out that the employer did not attempt to do so before it It is urged that the same principle should be applied to industrial adjudication It is said that on June 21, 1958, Sankaran came drunk to they mill and abused the Engineer, the Secretary and others and threatened them with physical violence Therefore if as in this case the employer wanted to take action for misconduct and then suddenly dropped the departmental proceedings which were intended to be held and decided to discharge the employee under r 18 (a) of the Standing orders, it was clearly a colourable exercise of the power under that rule in as much as that rule was used to get rid of an employee instead of following the course of holding an inquiry for misconduct, notice for which had been given to the employee and for which a departmental inquiry was intended to be held The tribunal therefore held that on the facts it could not come to the conclusion that Sankaran had come drunk to the mill and abused or attempted to assault either the Engineer or the Secretary or other officers
