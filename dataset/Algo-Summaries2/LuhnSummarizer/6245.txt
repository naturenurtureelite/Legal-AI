The short question in these appeals is as to whether the High Court was right in upholding the decision of the Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission to re hold the recruitment examination.
On the requisition of the State Government the State Public Service Commission had undertaken the recruitment to the post of Upper Zila Basic Shiksha Adhikari (Women), District Inspectress of Girls Schools/Associate Regional Inspectress of Girls Schools in Uttar Pradesh Educational Service Junior Scale (Women 's Branch) The advertisement inviting applications from eligible candidates was published on May 5, 1985 and a corrigendum was published on June 8, 1985.
After the written examina tion was over, on the basis of the results thereof success ful candidates upto a base limit have to be called to be interviewed.
On account of improper feeding into the comput er some of the candidates who had better performance in the written examination were not called and candidates securing lesser marks in the written examination were not only called for interview but were also finally selected.
When this position was known and upon an inquiry was factually estab lished, the Public Service Commission decided to cancel the entire recruitment examination and asked for re holding of it.
