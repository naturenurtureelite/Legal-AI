376/6 of 1952 53 and Criminal Appeals Nos.394/6, 395/6 and 392/6 of 1952 53 arising out of the Judgment and Order dated the 2nd June, 1952 of the Court of the Sessions Judge at Bidar in Sessions Case No.
The appeals and the confirmation proceedings in the High Court were heard by M. section Ali Khan and V. R. Deshpande, JJ.
On the question of sentence he considered that the death sentences on the three appellants, Pandurang, Tukia and Bhilia, should be maintained and that those of the other two should be commuted to transportation for life.
Pandurang, Tukia and Bhilia, who were sentenced to death, applied here for special leave to appeal.
Anyway, Rasika Bai heard shouts from that direction, so she ran to the river bank with Subhana and they both say that they saw all five accused attacking Ramchander with axes and sticks.
It is said that there is some discrepancy between Rasika Bai 's statement in the Sessions Court and in the Committal Court about the order in which the blows were given and their number.
The important thing is that both witnesses are agreed on the following points (1) that Tukia struck Ramchander on his cheek; 1087 Rasika Bai adds that he also struck him on the head; (2) that Pandurang hit him on the head; (3) that after these blows Ramchander fell down and then Bhilia hit him on the neck.
The dates of arrest and committal respectively in the case of each are as follows: Bhilia 9 1 1951 and 14 6 1951 Tukia 13 10 1951 and 10 1 1952 Pandurang 31 8 1951 and 10 1 1952 Tukaram 13 4 1951 and 29 9 1951 Nilia 13 10 1951 and 10 1 1952 The main attack on this evidence was directed to the fact that neither the accused nor the eye witnesses are named in the First Information Report.
Opposite the column headed "Name and address of the complainant or informant" is entered "Tukaram s/o Panda Sheolka".
The Sub Inspector, who wrote out the first information report on the basis of this report, entered the following in it: "I am to submit that today a report dated 7 12 1950 from the Police Patel, Neemgaon village, has been received stating that (1) Tukaram, s/o Panda Sheolka, r/o Neemgaon village, came and stated that on 7 12 1950 Ramchander, s/o Govind Reddy was murdered, etc".
