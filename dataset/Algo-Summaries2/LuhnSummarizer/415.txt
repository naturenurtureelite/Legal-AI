Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated the 9th August 1955 of the Bombay High Court in Criminal Application No.
This is an appeal by special leave against the judgment of the High Court of Bombay dismissing an application made to it under article 226 of the Constitution.
Whereas the Government of Bombay is satisfied with respect to the person known as Shri Lawrence Joachim Joseph DeSouza of Bombay, that with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the relations of India with the Portuguese Government and to the Security of India, it is necessary to make the following Order: Now, therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred by sub clause (1) of clause (a) of sub section (1) of section 3 of the (Act IV of 1950) the Government of Bombay is pleased to direct that Shri Lawrence Joachim Joseph DeSouza of Bombay, be detained.
385 4.The claim of State that no particulars of the grounds could be furnished in public interest is unsustainable and in any case mala fide.
The above high handed action of the police, by way of search and seizure, was the subject matter of challenge by the appellant by means of a writ application in the High Court in which the police officers concerned filed affidavits virtually admitting the appellant 's allegations relating to seizure of papers, etc.
The appellant 's counsel strongly urged that the bona fides of the detaining authority is to be judged with reference to the above background of events and that viewed in that light the vagueness of the grounds and the belated claim of privilege under article 22(6) of the Constitution strengthen his contention.
