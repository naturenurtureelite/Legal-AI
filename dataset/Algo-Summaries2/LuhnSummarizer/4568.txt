On his return to India, the appellant worked as Junior Lecturer and Clinical Assistant in the Department of Radiology at the Christian Medical College & Hospital, Vellore from February 6, 1959 to December 26, 1960.
As a consequence of a successful academic career as a teacher of post graduate courses in the Christian Medical College & Hospital, Vellore, the appellant was appointed as a Lecturer in Radiology under the West Bengal Health Scheme and held that post from January 2, 1961 to January 12, 1963.
On January 14, 1963 the appellant was appointed as a Lecturer in Radiology in Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi, a post placed in Category `E ' of the Central Health Service and continued to work in that capacity till October 8, 1964.
It would therefore appear that the appellant was not only holding the post of Radiologist in the Irwin Hospital, but was also actively associated with teaching the under graduate and post graduate students as an Associate Professor of Radiology of the Maulana Azad Medical College for the M.D., D.M.R.T.
The Government of India, Ministry of Health & Family Planning, Department of Health by its letter dated February 23, 1974 informed the Delhi Administration that the appellant could not be considered for appointment to the post of Associate Professor of Radiotherapy in the Maulana Azad Medical College inasmuch as he did not possess at least five years ' teaching experience as Reader/Assistant Professor in the concerned speciality as required under the Central Health Service (Amendment) Rules, 1966.
The Ministry of Health was of the view that although the appellant had the essential qualification prescribed for teaching post the teaching experience gained by him while holding the post of Radiologist cum Associate Professor of Radiology (ex officio) in the Irwin Hospital since October 9, 1964 cannot be taken into consideration.
The appellant assailed the impugned order by filing a writ petition in the Delhi High Court on July 24, 1974 complaining that the action of the Government of India in the Ministry of Health disregarding his claim for appointment to the post of Associate Professor of Radiotherapy was in denial of equal opportunity in matters of employment and thus violative of articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.
The contention upon which the writ petition was based was that on a true construction of r. 8 (2A) and paragraph 3 of Annexure I to the Second Schedule, he was clearly eligible for appointment to the post of Associate Professor as he had the essential educational qualification and had also the requisite teaching experience while holding the post of Radiologist cum Associate Professor of Radiology (ex officio) in the Irwin Hospital which is a teaching hospital attached to the Maulana Azad Medical College.
It appears that while the writ petition was pending in the High Court, the appellant was in 1976 selected by the Haryana Public Service Commission for the post of Professor of Radiology (Radiotherapy) in the Medical College, Rohtak, but was not relieved of his duties by the Government of India in the Ministry of Health & Family Planning.
A letter of the Registrar of the Rohtak University dated December 9, 1976 requesting the Central Government to place his services on deputation with the Rohtak University for a period of three years in the first instance as the appellant, having put in 17 years ' service, was not inclined to resign his post as Radiologist in the Irwin Hospital.
