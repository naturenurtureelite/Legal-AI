This appeal arises out of a judgment passed by the High Court of Allahabad in Civil Revision No.
83 of 1986 wherein the learned Judge of the High Court allowed the revision petition set aside the judgment and decree of the Trial Judge and decreed the plaintiff suit for ejectment of the appellant.
Learned counsel for the appellant contended that apart from the controversy about the date which should be the starting point for computing the period of 10 years in view of the language of Sections 39 and 40 of the Act, provisions of this Act will be applicable to the present case and therefore a decree for eviction could only be passed.
If it could be passed on anyone of the grounds mentioned in Section 20 clause 2 of this Act in support of this contention the learned counsel placed reliance on decisions in Om Prakash Gupta etc.
Learned counsel placed reliance on a decision in Firms Amar Nath Basheshar Dass vs Tek Chand, 11972] 3 SCR 922 and contended that this is a decision of three Judges Bench which clearly hold that if the suit was filed within a period of exemption then the suit could be decreed and the provisions of the Act will not be applicable.
Learned counsel further contended that in the decision in Vineet Kumar 's case (supra) on which reliance has been placed by learned counsel for the appellant the Firms Amar Naath Basheshar Dass 's case (supra) has not been referred to and decision in Vineet Kumar 's case (supra) is a judgment by a Bench of two Judges.
