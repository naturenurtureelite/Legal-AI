The appeals and the confirmation proceedings in the High Court were heard by M. section Ali Khan and V. R. Deshpande, JJ.
and they made the following order: "The circumstances of the crime in this case were such that a brutal murder had been committed and sentence of death was the only one legally possible for the Sessions Judge to have passed and it was confirmed by the High Court".
On 7 12 1950, about 3 o 'clock in the afternoon,, Ramchander Shelke (the deceased) went to his field known as "Bhavara" with his wife 's sister Rasika Bai (P.W.1) and his servant Subhana Rao (P.W.7).
Anyway, Rasika Bai heard shouts from that direction, so she ran to the river bank with Subhana and they both say that they saw all five accused attacking Ramchander with axes and sticks.
Two of the eye witnesses were considered unreliable by Reddy, J. in the High Court, so we will omit them from consideration and concentrate on the other two, Rasika Bai (P.W.1) and Subhana (P.W.7).
Rasika Bai 's version is that on seeing the assault she called out to the accused not to hit but they " raised their axes and sticks" and threatened her, and then ran away.
The dates of arrest and committal respectively in the case of each are as follows: Bhilia 9 1 1951 and 14 6 1951 Tukia 13 10 1951 and 10 1 1952 Pandurang 31 8 1951 and 10 1 1952 Tukaram 13 4 1951 and 29 9 1951 Nilia 13 10 1951 and 10 1 1952 The main attack on this evidence was directed to the fact that neither the accused nor the eye witnesses are named in the First Information Report.
Opposite the column headed "Name and address of the complainant or informant" is entered "Tukaram s/o Panda Sheolka".
In that he is not right (though the mistake is natural enough), because exhibit 4 merely places Tukaram 's name opposite the printed column headed "complainant or informant".
That leaves the matter equivocal but in view of what the Police Patel tells us, we think that he did mean to convey that 1089 Tukaram was the complainant, probably because he did not want to enter a woman 's name and so picked on the nearest male relative.
It did not reach the Police Station till 10 A.M. the next day though it was written about sunset the evening before, but as we do not know who took it and why he delayed it is idle to speculate.
