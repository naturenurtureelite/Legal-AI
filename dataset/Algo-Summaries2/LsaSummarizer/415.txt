Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated the 9th August 1955 of the Bombay High Court in Criminal Application No.
The challenge to the validity of the order based on the attack of mala fides and non application of the, mind of the detaining authority, have been urged before us with great insistence.
But under the guise thereof the police seized and carried away a mass of documents, papers and printed material of the appellant as also a typewriter belonging to him.
(2) When one Joaquim Carlos, a Portuguese soldier 386 attached to Goan forces, was arrested on a charge of entering Indian territory without the requisite authority, the appellant rendered professional assistance to him and obtained an order of release on bail from the Chief Presidency Magistrate, Bombay, which was foiled by the police by removing him away to Sawantwadi before the requisite sureties could be obtained at Bombay.
(3)Between April, 1955 to June, 1955, there occurred certain incidents which were inspired and instigated by the members of the Goan Action Committee who were agitating against Portuguese hold over Goa.
The appellant 's counsel strongly urged that the bona fides of the detaining authority is to be judged with reference to the above background of events and that viewed in that light the vagueness of the grounds and the belated claim of privilege under article 22(6) of the Constitution strengthen his contention.
