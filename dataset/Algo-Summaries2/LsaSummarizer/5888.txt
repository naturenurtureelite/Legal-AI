The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SABYASACHI MUKHARJI, J.
The order dated 25th March, 1988 of the Collector is under challenge in this appeal.
Puksha, District Samastipur had bid for Rs.11,900 (Rupees eleven thousands only) per month Dak in an auction of Beni Country liquor shop held on 27.3.88 and he as given the shop of Beni Country liquor but after signing in Bandobasti Register he did not deposit dak amount.
Samastipur is therefore placed in the black list for future under the orders passed by the Collector, Samastipur. "
The letter dated 25th March, 1988, states as follows: "The Collector of the district after perusal of the said office note passed order on 25.3.88 which is produced in verbatim below: Ist bidder chunki defaulter hai atah security prapt kar len tatha bhavishya ke liae Black list karen. "
It was contended on behalf of the State Government that there was no requirement in the rule of giving any prior notice before black listing any person.
In so far as the contention that there is no requirement specifically of giving any notice is concerned, the respondent is right.
It has to be realised that black listing any person in respect of business ventures has civil consequence for the future business of the person concerned in any event.
