Goswami, Additional Solicitor General, Kailash Vasdev and Ms. A Subhashini for the Respondents.
The Import & Export Policy for the period April 1978 to March 1979, in para 174, made provision for grant of certain import facilities to Export Houses which were registered in accordance with the provisions of the said Policy.
One of the said facilities was grant of an Additional licence in terms of para 176 of the said Policy for an amount to be calculated at one third the f.o.b.
The said order refusing the Export Certificate was challenged by the petitioners by filing writ petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution before the Bombay High Court.
1423 of 1984, Union of India vs Rajnikant Brothers, and other connected matters by order dated April 18, 1985, wherein it was observed that there was no requirement of diversification of exports as a condition for the grant of Export House Certificates in theImport Policy for the year 1978 1979, and the authorities were directed to issue necessary Export Certificates for the year 1978 79.
The writ petition and the appeal were decided by the Bombay High Court in accordance with the aforesaid decision of this Court in the case of Union of India vs Rajnikant Brothers, (supra) and the High Court directed the authorities to grant Export House Certificates to the petitioners under the Import Policy 1978 79 within three months.
While construing the aforesaid direction contained in its order dated April 18, 1985, in Rajnikant Brothers case (supra) this Court has held that the grantees of the Additional licences were not only prohibited from importing items which were excluded under the Export Policy 1978 79 but also from importing items excluded under the Import Policy prevailing at the time of import and that the word "banned" was intended to take in terms which were banned altogether as well as items which were banned for import by the holder of an Additional licence.
Ltd. & Anr., ; this Court construed the words 'whether canalised or otherwise ' contained in the order dated April 18, 1985, passed in Rajnikant Brothers case (supra) and it was observed that the Court would not know whether in the future certain canalised items could be imported directly by an Export House holding an Additional licence and that the possibility of a policy being framed in the future enabling an Export House holding an Additional licence to directly import items which are `non canalised ' and also item which are `canalised ' could not be ruled out and it was in this light that the Court can be said to have used the words "whether canalised or otherwise" in the order dated April 18, 1985.
(P. 1000) In accordance with the directions given by the Bombay High Court the petitioners in writ petition No.
460 of 1988 herein were granted the Export House Certificate and an Additional licence dated August 31, 1987.
These licences were valid for a period of 12 months and they contained the following endorsement: "This licence in valid for import of items permissible to Export Houses under the Additional Licence category as per para 176 of Import Policy for the period 1978 79 excluding those items which were banner in the policy for the period 1978 79 and those which have been specifically banned in the prevailing Import Policy, 1985 88, pursuant to and subject to the decision of the Supreme Court dated 5.3.1986 in M/s.
3418/1986; the decision dated 12.9.1986 in the case of M/s Star Diamonds Company of India in civil misc.
xxx" It appears that the petitioners were not able to make imports under the said Additional licences till March 31, 1988.
In sub para(4) 215 it has been provided as under: "(4) Additional licences issued to Export Houses will also be valid for the import of the following items upto 10% (upto 15% in the case of Trading Houses) of the value of the licence for: (i) Import of technical designs, drawings and other technical documentation for a value not exceeding Rs.
value of a `single item ' shall not exceed 10% of the flexibility in value terms of Rs.10 lakhs, whichever is less: (b) where the value for import of a `single item ' on the basis of 10% as at (a) above, works out to less than Rupees one lakh, import would be permitted upto a value of Rs.
1 lakh, provided it is within the overall flexibility allowed on the licence: and (iii) import of non OGL capital goods (other than those appearing in Appendices 1 Part A and 8) without indigenous clearance, subject to the same conditions as stipulated at (ii) above, within the overall flexibility allowed to Export/Trading Houses".
In para 217, it is prescribed that Export Trading House Certificates issued prior to April 1, 1988 would continue to be valid till the date of the expiry and the Export House Trading House can apply for fresh certificates, if they fulfil the eligibility conditions laid down in the policy and in cases where these Certificates are expiring on 31st March, 1988, and the applicants do not fulfil the eligibility conditions for recognition laid down under the revised Policy, recognition would be granted for one year only if they fulfil conditions for renewal of these Certificates as laid down in the Import Policy, 1985 88.
(1) Where the applications from Export Houses/Trading Houses for Additional licences have not been disposed of by 31st March of the proceeding licensing year, the rate of entitlement will be the same as permissible during the licensing year to which the application pertains, but the items to be allowed will be as per the Import Policy in force on the date of issue of the licence.

(7) Additional licences issued to Export Houses/Trading Houses prior to 1.4.1988 will also be valid within their overall value, for import of raw materials, components, consumables and spares appearing in Appendix 6, List 8, Part A of this Policy.
Similarly, such licences will also be valid for import of items of capital goods now covered by Appendix 1, Part B of this Policy within their overall value.
