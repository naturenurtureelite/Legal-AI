(b) thereof and there is a conflict of opinion between the High Courts of Calcutta and Bombay on the question.
On a literal construction of the term 'officer or employee ' occurring in sub section (1) of section 630 of H 172 the Act, the High Court of Calcutta in Amritlal Chum vs Devi Ranjan Jha & Anr., held that it refers only to the existing officers and employees of a company.
The High Court of Bombay, on the other hand, has placed a beneficent construction on the provisions contained in section 630 and according to it, the term 'officer or employee ' in sub section (1) of section 630 must be interpreted to mean not only the present officers and employees of a company but also to include past officers and employees of the company.

At the conclusion of the hearing we had by a short order dismissed the special leave petition and held that the view expressed by the learned Single Judge following the earlier decisions of the High Court in Harkishan Lakhimal Gidwani and reiterated in Govind T. Jagtiani was to be preferred to the view to the contrary expressed by the High Court of Calcutta in Amritlal Chum.
