Appeal by Special leave from the judgment and order dated the 9th November, 1979 of the Delhi High Court in CWP No.885 of 1974.
This appeal by special leave from a judgment and order of the Delhi High Court dated January 9, 1979 raises a question of some complexity.
In exercise of the powers conferred by the proviso to Art.309 of the Constitution, the President on May 1, 1963 made the Central Health Service Rules, 1963 which came into force 18 on May 5, 1963.
It would therefore appear that there is 50% direct recruitment in Supertime Grade II which practice is in the public interest and is essential for the maintenance of efficiency.
The Supertime Grade II will thus consist only of administrative posts in future for which the revised scale will be Rs.
There could be interchange between hospital specialists and Professors in the higher grade subject to the candidates satisfying the prescribed qualifications.
As at present constituted, the Central Health Service has the following grade structure as per the recommendations of the Third Pay Commission : ____________________________________________________________ section No.
There he studied Radiotherapy for two years at the Liverpool Radium Institute and obtained the Diploma in Medical Radiology & Therapy (D.M.R.T.)
During the course of his studies there, he held the appointment of Registrar in Radiotherapy at the Liverpool Radium Institute from August 1957 to December 1958.
On his return to India, the appellant worked as Junior Lecturer and Clinical Assistant in the Department of Radiology at the Christian Medical College & Hospital, Vellore from February 6, 1959 to December 26, 1960.
During his stay there he was placed in charge of the Department of Radiotherapy during the absence of Professor Scudder, and as he had considerable experience in the United Kingdom in the practical aspect of handling such cases, he proved to be extremely useful to the institution.
The State Government of West Bengal were pleased to depute him for the task and he apparently performed and fulfilled his duties to the entire satisfaction of the authorities.
On January 14, 1963 the appellant was appointed as a Lecturer in Radiology in Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi, a post placed in Category `E ' of the Central Health Service and continued to work in that capacity till October 8, 1964.
By Letter dated April 6, 1965, the Delhi Administration informed the Principal, Maulana Azad Medical College in answer to a communication made by him, that consequent upon the appointment of the appellant in Category `C ' of the Central Health Service, the Administration had no objection to designating him as Associate Professor of Radiology (ex officio) in the Maulana Azad Medical 25 College provided it was not detrimental to his normal duties as a Radiologist and no financial implications were involved.
In pursuance of r. 7A (1) (b) of the Central Health Service Rules, 1963, as amended by the Central Health Service (Amendment) Rules, 1966 and all other powers enabling him in that behalf, the President of India issued a notification dated June 8, 1967 making substantive appointments of 80 officers to the Specialists ' Grade with effect from September 9, 1966.
26 It appears that subsequent to his substantive appointment by the President to Specialists ' Grade with effect from September 9, 1966, the appellant was called by the Banaras Hindu University for an interview on August 7, 1972 for the post of Professor of Radiotherapy but since the post of Associate Professor of Radiotherapy in Maulana Azad Medical College was falling vacant in 1973, he did not appear for the interview.
Mittal, Lecturer in Radiology in the Maulana Azad Medical College as Associate Professor of Radiotherapy ignoring the claim of the appellant.
The appellant assailed the impugned order by filing a writ petition in the Delhi High Court on July 24, 1974 complaining that the action of the Government of India in the Ministry of Health disregarding his claim for appointment to the post of Associate Professor of Radiotherapy was in denial of equal opportunity in matters of employment and thus violative of articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.
The contention upon which the writ petition was based was that on a true construction of r. 8 (2A) and paragraph 3 of Annexure I to the Second Schedule, he was clearly eligible for appointment to the post of Associate Professor as he had the essential educational qualification and had also the requisite teaching experience while holding the post of Radiologist cum Associate Professor of Radiology (ex officio) in the Irwin Hospital which is a teaching hospital attached to the Maulana Azad Medical College.
1 and 2 filed a return reiterating the stand 27 taken by the Government of India in the Health Ministry that the experience gained by the appellant as an Associate Professor of Radiology (ex officio) by virtue of his holding the post of Radiologist in the Irwin Hospital cannot be taken into consideration for the purpose of determining the question of his eligibility for appointment as Associate Professor.
In support of the plea, it was averred: "The teaching experience gained by the petitioner while holding the post of Radiologist in the Irwin Hospital, New Delhi by virtue of his having ex officio status of Associate Professor of Radiotherapy from the 9th of October, 1964 cannot be counted as requisite teaching experience under the Central Health Service Rules. "
It appears that while the writ petition was pending in the High Court, the appellant was in 1976 selected by the Haryana Public Service Commission for the post of Professor of Radiology (Radiotherapy) in the Medical College, Rohtak, but was not relieved of his duties by the Government of India in the Ministry of Health & Family Planning.
