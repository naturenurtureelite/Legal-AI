But what the learned counsel for the appellants says is that he saw Narsabai on the evening of the murder and as she did not give him any names it is evident that no one knew who the assailants were and that therefore the accusation made against the accused was a subsequent concoction and that it was for that reason that they waited till the next morning before reporting the matter to the police.
We do not intend to examine that here because we are of opinion that the sentence should be reduced to transportation in these two cases mainly because of the difference of opinion in the High Court, not only on the question of guilt, but also on that of sentence.
We uphold his conviction under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code.
Rasika Bai 's version is that on seeing the assault she called out to the accused not to hit but they " raised their axes and sticks" and threatened her, and then ran away.
In the present case, there is no evidence of any prior meeting.
They say they saw all five accused striking him, the three appellants Pandurang, Tukia and Bhilia with axes, the other two, who have not appealed, with sticks.

We refer to the other eye witnesses here to show that there is no discrepancy on this point, but we only rely on Rasikabai and Subhana for determining the fact Bhilia was directly charged with the murder and the injury on the throat is ascribed to him in the charge.
He also admits that he saw Narsabai there but says he did not speak to her.
The petition was heard by Ali Khan and Reddy, JJ.
Bhilia, Tukia and Nilia are Lambadas, Pandurang is a Hatkar and Tukaram a Maratha.
