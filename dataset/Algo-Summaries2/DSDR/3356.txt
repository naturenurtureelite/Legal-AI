But the fact that the witness has stated in the first information report that the deceased was only mentioning the name of accused Karunakaran as his assailant, this earlier version appears to be contradicted by the medical evidence.
It was also observed that the High Court "can place no reliance on the testimony of PW 4 in so far as he implicated the second accused and Tharnizharasan in the case of murder of Viswanatham".
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by GOSWAMI, J. This appeal by special leave is directed against the 4 judgment and order of the, High Court of Madras convicting the appellant (hereinafter to be described as the accused) under section 302 IPC and sentencing him to death.
P.M. I woke up on hearing a noise to the effect 'younger brother, Karunakaran is running after stabbing me with knife, 'catch him '.

The High Court acquitted accused Jabamani Nadar alias Kanyakumari Comrade alias Ramu and accepted the reference in respect of the present accused.
On the other hand we find that there is a mention about a pool of blood only where the dead body was found at No. 1 in the site plan.
It also stands to reason that those persons who gathered would not ask PW 4, who arrived at the place a little later, for information with regard to the assailants.
S.R. Appeal allowed.
We further find from the evidence of PW 4 in cross examination that when he went near his deceased elder brother about hundred persons were there and "none of them asked him as to how it had happened".
This may not, in a given case, be considered as a very serious infirmity since the witness may not have seen the other.
The High Court is not even right that PW 4 stands wholly corroborated by the contents of the FIR.
Besides, he has deliberately changed his own stand in court when he deposed that he saw two other persons running ahead of Karunakaran being chased by his two brothers and Ramaswamy.
