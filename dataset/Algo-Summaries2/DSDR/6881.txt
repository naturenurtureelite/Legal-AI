Secondly, in the brother or brother 's son of the vendor; Thirdly, in the father 's brother or father 's brother 's son of the vendor; Fourthly, in the tenant who holds under tenan cy of the vendor the land or properly sold or a part thereof Co) where the sale is of a share out of joint land or property and is not made by all the co sharers jointly First, in the sons or daughters or son 's son or daughter 's sons of the vendor or vendors; Secondly, in the brothers or brother 's sons of the vendor or vendors; Thirdly, in the father 's brother or father 's brother 's sons of the vendor or vendors; Fourthly, in the other co sharers; Fifthly, in the tenants who hold under tenancy of the vendor or vendors the land or property sold or a part thereof; (c) where the sale is of land or property owned jointly and is made by all the co shar ers jointly 123 First, in the sons or daughters or sons ' sons or daughters ' sons of the vendors; Secondly in the brothers or brother 's sons of the vendors; Thirdly, in the father 's brothers or father 's brother 's sons of the vendors Fourthly, in the tenants, who hold under tenancy of the vendors or any one of them the land or properly sold or a part thereof.
In taking this view strong reliance was placed on the ratio of the decision of this court in Bhau Ram vs B. Baijnath Singh, ; wherein the vires of a provision of the Rewa State Pre emption Act which conferred a right of pre emption based on vicinage and the right of preemption conferred on co sharers and the Punjab Pre emption Act, 1913 were challenged on the ground of infraction of Article 19(1) (f) of the Constitu tion.
This Court, therefore, upheld the constitutional validity of clause 'fourthly of section 15(1)(a) clauses 'fourthly ' and 'fifthly ' of section 15(1)(b) and clause fourthly of section 15(1)(c) as valid and not infringing Articles 14 or 15 of the Constitution This Court, however, did not find any justification for the classification contained m section 15 which conferred a right of pre emption on the kinsfolk.
Where the sale is of a share out of joint land or property, and is, not made by all the co sharers jointly, only the other co sharers and the tenants can exercise the right of pre emption.
We find it diffi cult to hold that the purport of the of Court 's decision in Attam Prakash 's case was to deny the right of pre emption to those relative or relatives of the vendor or vendors who were specified in the erstwhile first three clauses of section 15(1)(b) even if they happen to be co sharers.
In that case also this Court held that the right of pre emption vested in co shar ers was a reasonable restriction on the right to hold, acquire or dispose of property conferred by Article 19(1)(1) of the Constitution.
Persons in whom right of pre emption vests in respect of sales of agricultural land and village immovable property (1) The right of pre emption in respect of agricultural land and village immovable property shall vest (a) where the sale is by a sole onwer First, in the son or daughter or son 's son or daughter 's son of the vendor;
Read in the context, it becomes clear that the legislature desired to confer the right of pre emption on specified family members of the vendor or vendors in the first three clauses of section 15(1)(b) and with a view to covering all the remaining co sharers not specifically mentioned the preceding clauses it used the expression 'other co sharers ' in the fourth clause which was meant to serve as a residuary clause to ensure 127 that, no co sharer is left out.
Under the Punjab Pre emption Act, 1905, the corresponding provision, section 12, con ferred a right of pre emption, in the case of a sale of a share of such land or properly held jointly, firstly, in the lineal discendents of the vendor in male line in order of succession; secondly, in the co sharers, if any, who are agnates, in order of succession; thirdly, in the persons described in sub clause (a) i.e. in persons who but for such sale would be entitled to inherit the properly in the event of his or their decease, in order of succession and fourth ly, in the co sharers jointly or severally.
We, therefore, do not approve the ratio of Jagdish 's case and overrule the same.
" This Court in Atam Prakash vs State of Haryana & Ors, ; ; held that the right of pre emption given to co sharers as well as to a tenant can be justified as they constitute a class by themselves.
