Criminal Appeal 7 of 1977 was filed by Sitaram @
After hearing the learned counsel for the parties we allowed the appeal of Prakash, accused 5 and acquitted him and set aside his conviction and the sentence awarded to him.
We are of the opinion that the retracted judicial confession of accused 5 could not be relied upon against accused 6 in this case in view of the fact that accused 6 who had been tried alongwith accused 5 had been acquitted by the High Court of the charge of conspiracy under section 302 read with section 120B I.P.C. and accused 5 was not charged for the offence of murder of Malan for which only accused 1, 6 and 7 were tried.

Appeal Nos.
In 784 that case the charge under section 120B I.P.C. was framed against four named persons who had been arrayed as accused 1 to 4.
The High Court found that the evidence of P.W. 44 and 45 does not establish beyond reasonable doubt that accused 6 was found in the company of accused 7 and the approver P.W. 1 near about the place of occurrence as alleged by the prosecution before and after the murder of Malan.
