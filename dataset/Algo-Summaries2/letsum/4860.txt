No. 605 of 1978 filed against that acquittal which, as stated earlier, was filed only against accused 2,3,4 and 7 not against accused 1 and 6, in so far as it related to accused 2, 3, 4 and 7, Mr. V. section Desai, learned senior counsel appearing for Prakash, accused 5, contended in his arguments that the conviction of that accused alone for conspiracy under section 302 read with section 120B I.P.C. is unsustainable in law as at least two persons are required for an offence of conspiracy under section 120A I.P.C. and he relied upon a decision of this Court in Topandas vs State of Bombay(1) in support of his contention.
No. 1 farmed against them under section 302 read with section 120B I.P.C. and no appeal against their acquittal had been filed in the High Court and also the fact that accused 5 was not a party to charge No.4 which was framed only against accused 1, 6 and 7.
