The entry No. 4 occurs in a schedule in which descriptions of goods to be taxed indicate that the expression "required for use there with" has been employed for equipment or accessories connected with the main purpose.
For instance, in entry No. 5 the expression occurs at the end as follows: "Photographic and other cameras and enlargers, films and plates, paper and cloth and other parts and accessories required for use therewith".
Entry No. 2, relating to refrigerators, air conditioning plants covers also "component parts thereof".
No. 3, for "wireless reception instruments and apparatus" includes "electrical valves, accumulators, amplifiers and loud speakers and spare parts and accessories thereof ' '.
No. 6 for clocks, time pieces and watches, entry No. 10 for dictaphones and other similar apparatus for recording sound, and entry No. 11 for sound transmitting equipment such as telephones and loud speakers.
No. 4 occurs, is to show that some precision has been attempted in making the entries.
We find that the term "accessories" is used in the schedule to describe goods which may have been manufactured for use as an aid or addition.
"Accessories" are not necessarily confined to particular machines for which they; may serve as aids.
The same item may be an accessory of more than one kind of instrument.
The fact that they can also be used for search lights, signalling, stage lighting, or where powerful lighting for photography or other purposes may be required, could not detract from the classification to which the carbon arcs belong.
No. 4.
