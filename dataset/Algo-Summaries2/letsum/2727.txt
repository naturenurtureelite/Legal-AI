M.K. Ramamurthi, Vineet Kumar, L Ramamurthy and Shyamala Pappu, for the appellant.
The appellant 'brought the suit in O.S. No. 3 of 1961 in the Court of Subordinate Judge, Nagapattinam for setting aside the order dated May 10, 1960 of respondent No. 1 the Commissioner of Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments, Madras who had affirmed earlier the order of the second respondent, the Deputy Commissioner, holding that the trusteeship of the Kumaran Koil in Manjakollai village was not hereditary.
The appellant was elected as a trustee by the Sengunatha Mudaliars of Manjakollai village at a meeting held on June 27, 1957.
According to the appellant the temple was rounded two hundred years ago by the members of his community and since then the management of the temple and is affairs was always vested in the community of the Sengunatha Mudaliars and no person other than the elected trustee had at any time the right of management and control of the temple.
The respondents, however, took a different view and proceeded on the basis that trusteeship of the Kumaran Koil was not hereditary.
The contention on behalf of the appellant is that the succession is "regulated by usage".
It was said that according to the usage of the temple the trustees were elected for a period of one year each at a meeting of the members of the Sangunatha Mudaliar Community and so the appellant must be held to be a trustee within the meaning of section 6(9) of Act 19 of 1951.
Krishnan J., stated as follows: "Where succession is by nomination by the holder in office of his successor it seems to be impossible to contend that it is a hereditary succession.
But the election to the office of trustee in the present case is for a fixed period of one year and not for life.
A.V. Rangam, for the respondents.
