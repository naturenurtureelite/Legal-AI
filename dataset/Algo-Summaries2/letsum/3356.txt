Appeal by Special Leave from the Judgment and order dated the 22nd July 1974 of the Madras High Court at Madras in Criminal Appeal No. 24 of 1974 and Referred Trial A. N. Mulla, K. Jayaram and P. Chandrasekhar for the Appellant. , A. V. Rangam and Miss A. Subhasini for the Respondent.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by GOSWAMI, J. This appeal by special leave is directed against the 4 judgment and order of the, High Court of Madras convicting the appellant (hereinafter to be described as the accused) under section 302 IPC and sentencing him to death.
Hence this appeal by special leave.
On April 26, 1971, at about 10.00 P.M. he was sleeping on a bench outside his cattle shed in the open space, which is shown in the site plan (exhibit P15) at No. 9.
The younger brother of the deceased, Pandurangam (PW 4), who is a leper, was also sleeping on the eastern parapet of the sluice of the north Boothagudi channel, which is shown at No. 5 in the site plan (exhibit P15).
In the first information report which PW 4 lodged at the Thana, which is very close to the place of occurrence, within about 15 minutes of the occurrence, inter alia, stated thus: 4 L159SCI/76 710 At about 11.15.
In that ' case even corroboration may not be sought for.
ordinarily in an appeal under article 136 of the Constitution we would have hestitated to go into the facts to reappreciate the evidence.
This witness may not have a qualm of conscience in implicating the accused for the 711 mere asking by someone, if not by the inimical police officer (PW 23) against whom criminal cases were pending at the instance of the accused 's father.
It failed to notice certain broad facts which should definitely weigh with the court while appreciating ocular testimony.
This may not, in a given case, be considered as a very serious infirmity since the witness may not have seen the other.
