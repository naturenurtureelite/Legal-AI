We are therefore of opinion that Ujagar Singh 's statement about the appellant 's confessing to him that he had murdered Sheo Sahai has been erroneously rejected by the High Court.
The Courts below rightly did not accept his version.
Ujagar Singh was on the field for the purpose of watching it against the neel gais trespassing and grazing the crop.
The extra judicial confession of the appellant to Ujagar Singh finds ample support from the facts that the appellant did purchase a sword a day before, that very sword was found to be stained with human blood shortly after the murder and that sword was handed over by the appellant himself to the Police Officer at the Police Station.
led him to have a bath at that hour at night.
The High Court, however, did not rely on this extra judicial confession.
The learned Judges have not stated those considerations, if any, in addition to the improbability of Ujagar Singh 's presence in his field on account of the crops being not very high, which made them doubt the appellant 's confessing to Ujagar Singh.
Appeal dismissed.
