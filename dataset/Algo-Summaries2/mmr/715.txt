Appeal dismissed.
All conciliation proceedings under this sub section shall be deemed to have concluded in the case where no settlement is reached, when the report of the Conciliation Officer is received by the appropriate Government.
On March 18, 1952, the appellant dismissed Louis Pereira, a bus conductor and proceedings were taken on a complaint by Assistant Commissioner of Labour under section 33 read with section 31 of the Act against 5 accused persons the two appellants and the partners of appellant No. 1.
No doubt section 12 contemplates that the report should be made and the proceedings closed within a fortnight and if proceedings are not closed but are carried on, as they were in the present case, or if the Conciliation Officer does not make his report within 14 days he may be guilty of a breach of duty but in law the proceedings do not automatically come to an end after 14 days but only terminate as provided in section 20(2)(b) of the Act.
Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated the February 4, 1955, of the Bombay High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 1256 of 1954, arising out of the judgment and order dated June 19, 1954, of the Chief Presidency Magistrate, Bombay, in Case No. 176/S of 1953.
