Sub section
Appeal dismissed.
The power of the Custodian under the , to allot any property to a person or to cancel an allotment existing in favour of a person rests on the fact that the property vests in him.
It is not disputed that the appellants ceased to hold and had lost possession of the Raikot lands before the publication of this notification.
On January 6, 1955, the appellants moved the Deputy Custodian General for calling up their review application and for revising the order of October 31, 1952 passed by the Additional Custodian cancelling the allotment of Raikot lands which had originally been made in their favour in the year 1949.
(1) of section 19 of the 1954 Act are to prevail notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force.
It is common ground that by notification section R. 0. 697 dated March 24, 1955 the Central Government decided to acquire all evacuee property allotted to displaced persons by the Custodian under the "Conditions" contained in the notification of the Government of Punjab in the Department of Rehabilitation, No. 4892 6 dated July 8, 1949, except certain categories of property specified in the schedule.
His contention appears to be that there is nothing to show that this property was "entrusted" to a managing officer.
