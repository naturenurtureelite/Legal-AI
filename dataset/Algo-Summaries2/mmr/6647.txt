vs Union of India & Ors.
(10) Additional licences issued on Export Houses/Trading Houses prior to 1.4.1988, or issued after 1.4.1988 on exports made during 1986 87 or earlier periods, will not be eligible for the flexibilities in the import of items of raw materials, components and consumables covered by Appendices 3 and 5 Part A and items of non OGL capital goods (other than those covered by Appendices 1 Part A and 8) available under this Policy.
The said 10% value can be 245 increased to 12% in cases where the Export House is able to achieve a minimum growth of 10% in terms of realisation in the previous year, over the above the year preceding the same.
That 247 was not the issue before this Court.
T.N.A. Petitions dismissed.
A close examination of the Import & Export Policy 1978 79 under which the petitioners have been granted the Additional licences and the Import & Export Policy 1988 91 shows that there is material difference between the conditions for grant of Additional licences under Import Policy 1978 79 and the conditions for grant of such licences under the Import Policy 1988 91 and it cannot be said that the petitioners who have been granted Additional licences under the Import & Export Policy 1978 79 and the Export & Import Policy 1988 91 are persons similarly circumstanced.
In para 176 of the said Policy it was laid down that the value of the Additional licences to be granted for 1978 79 would be calculated at one third of the f.o.b. value of the export of select products made in 1977 78 and manufactured by the small scale and cottage industries 244 plus 5% of the f.o.b. value of other exports of select products made in the same year.
Similarly, such licences will also be valid for import of items of capital goods now covered by Appendix 1, Part B of this Policy within their overall value.
The petitioner were no granted Additional licences on the basis of net foreign exchange earnings and they have secured the Additional licences on the basis of the f.o.b. value of the exports, without taking into account the value of the goods imported by them for achieving the exports.
They would be entitled to import items which were canalised or not if the import policy prevailing at the time of import permitted them to import items falling under such category.
Similarly, the petitioners in 238 writ petition No. 460 of 1988 herein were granted the Export House Certificate and an Additional licence dated August 31, 1987.
(3) The Additional licences issued prior to 1.4.1988 240 shall cease to be valid for import of items of raw materials, components and spares which appeared in Parts I and II of List 8, Appendix 6 of Import Export Policy, 1985 88, but are not now covered by Part I of List 8, Appendix 6 of this Policy.
Among the conditions for eligibility for grant of such Certificates are that the annual average NFE earnings in the prescribed base period should not be less than Rs. 2 crores in the case of Export House and Rs. 10 crores in the case of Trading Houses and the NEF earnings in none of the three years of the base period should be less than 25% of the minimum average NFE earnings prescribed.
This was also viewed in that light in the case of Indo Afghan Chambers of Commerce (supra).
While the said appeal and the other writ petition (filed by the petitioners viz. writ petition No. 459 of 1988 herein) were pending in the Bombay High Court, this Court decided Civil Appeal No. 1423 of 1984, Union of India vs Rajnikant Brothers, and other connected matters by order dated April 18, 1985, wherein it was observed that there was no requirement of diversification of exports as a condition for the grant of Export House Certificates in theImport Policy for the year 1978 1979, and the authorities were directed to issue necessary Export Certificates for the year 1978 79.
This Court did not say that canalised items could be imported directly by the importers ignoring the canalisation process.
In D. navinchandra & Co. case (supra) this Court has not laid down that Export Houses, like the petitioners, who are granted Additional licences on the basis of the order Dated April 18, 1985, are to be treated at par with Export Houses who are granted Additional licences under Import & Export Policy prevalent at the time of import.
These licences when issued to Trading Houses, will also be valid for import of the items appearing in Appendices 3 and 5 Part A of this Policy, subject to the conditions laid down in this regard, in the Import Export Policy, 1985 88.
