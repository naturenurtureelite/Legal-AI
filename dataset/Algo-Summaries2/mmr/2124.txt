D.N. Mukherjee, for the respondent (in C.A. No. 931 of 1965) and the appellant (in C.A. No. 1149 of 1965).
He held that the Sahas formed "a group within the Sunri caste be it a sub caste strictly so called or other 390 wise".
He challenges the validity of the order of the High Court setting aside his election.
It is natural to think that if the excluded Sahas were those Sunris who bore the surname Saha, the Order would have made that clear.
The learned Judge, therefore, held that as the appellant bore the surname Saha, he did not belong to the Scheduled Caste specified in item 40 though he was a Sunri.
In the election petition, the respondent had stated that the appellant, was a member of the Saha caste and not a member of any Schedule Caste.
We are unable to agree with either of these interpretations.
There is no doubt that Sunri is a caste.
