It is not stated by sub Inspector Kishan Singh, nor it is alleged that the appellant had on his person or on his clothes blood stains when he presented himself at the Police Station.
Both on account of the temperature and on account of the culprit 's desire to wash of blood marks on his person, the appellant 's bathing in the Canal at that hour of the night cannot be said to be improbable.
The fact that he had the sword which was stained with human blood, leads to such a supposition, even if the mere possession of a sword so stained be not sufficient to establish conclusively that the person who possessed it so shortly after the murder of a person with whom he had enmity, had committed the murder.
There is no reason to think that the appellant would not make such a statement when the appellant himself proceeds to the Police Station and hands over the blood stained sword.
We agree with the view of the learned Sessions Judge and do not consider Ujagar Singh 's conduct of continuing to remain on his field during the night to be so improbable as to affect his veracity.
