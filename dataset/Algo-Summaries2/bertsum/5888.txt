It was contended on behalf of the State Government that there was no requirement in the rule of giving any prior notice before black listing any person.
We, however, make it quite clear that we are not expressing any opinion on the correctness or otherwise of the allegations made against the appellant.
Even if the rules do not express so, it is an elementary principle of natural justice that parties affected by any order should have right of being heard and making representations against the order.
In the premises, that portion of the order directing that the appellant be placed in the black list in respect of future contracts under the Collector is set aside.
It has to be realised that black listing any person in respect of business ventures has civil consequence for the future business of the person concerned in any event.
But it is an implied principle of the rule of law that any order having civil consequence should be passed only after following the PG NO 869 principles of natural justice.
In that view of the matter, the last portion of the order in so far as it directs black listing of the appellant in respect of future contracts, cannot be sustained in law.
