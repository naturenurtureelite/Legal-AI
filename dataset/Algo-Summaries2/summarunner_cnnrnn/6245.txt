We allow the appeals, set aside the judgment of the High Court and direct that the order of the Public Service Com mission cancelling the written examination shall stand vacated.
The short question in these appeals is as to whether the High Court was right in upholding the decision of the Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission to re hold the recruitment examination.
The recruitment examination was in two stages written and interview/personality test.
125 From the Judgment and Order dated 29.7.1988 of the Allahabad High Court in C.M.W.P. No. 11933 & 16493/1987.
R.K. Garg, S.P. Singh, N.M. Popli, R.B. Misra, Uma Nath Misra and R.C. Kaushik for the Appellants.
On the facts alleged we direct that the recruitment which is now to be re done by completing the interview examination should be finalised within four months hence.
On the other hand, the situation could have been appropriately met by setting aside the recruitment and asking for a 126 fresh interview of all eligible candidates on the basis of the written examination and select those who on the basis of the written and the freshly held interview became eligible for selection.
