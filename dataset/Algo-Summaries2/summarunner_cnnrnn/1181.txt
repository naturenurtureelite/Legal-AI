Achhru Ram and K. L. Mehta for the appellants.
These fourteen allottees preferred an application for review of the order cancelling their allotment on the ground that this cancellation was a result of misapprehension of the actual facts and that they were not entitled to allotment of suburban lands at all.

As a result of this order the allotment of Karodian land made in favour of the appellants automatically stood cancelled.
