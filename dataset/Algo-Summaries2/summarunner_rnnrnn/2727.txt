In our opinion, there is no warrant for this argument.
It is not the case of the appellant that the trustees of the temple of the Kumaran Koil are hereditary trustees because their office ' devolves by hereditary right or because succession to that office is specifically provided for by the founder.
The contention on behalf of the appellant is that the succession is "regulated by usage".
In Sital Das vs Sant Ram(5) the law was taken as wellsettled that succession to mahantship of a mutt or religious institution is regulated by custom or usage of the particular institution except where the rule of succession is laid down by the founder himself who created the endowment.
In that case the custom in (1) (2) 63 I. A. 448.
The question to be considered in this appeal is whether the appellant is a hereditary trustee Within the meaning of the section.
This is so whether the trustee has a beneficial interest of some sort or not (see Ganesh Chunder Dhur vs Lal Behary(2) and Bhabatarini vs Ashalata(3).
For these reasons we hold that this appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs.
Ordinarily a shebaitship or the office of dharmakartha is vested in the heirs of the founder unless the ,founder has laid down a special scheme of succession or except when usage or custom to the contrary is proved to exist.
