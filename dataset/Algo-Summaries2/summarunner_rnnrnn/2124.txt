The error of the Tribunal lay in interpreting the Order in the light of the evidence before it.
The learned Judges of the High Court thought that the effect of the item was to exclude from the Sunri caste those who belonged to that caste but bore the surname Saha.
If the correct interpretation of item 40 was, as we think it was, that Sahas were a caste group within the Sunri caste, no question of Sahas being a distinct class independent of Sunris ,could arise.
The Tribunal rejected the respondent 's case that the Sunri caste was divided into certain groups of which the Sahas formed one.
In the election petition, the respondent had stated that the appellant, was a member of the Saha caste and not a member of any Schedule Caste.
Nobody disputes that.
