Those four pieces of evidence are: (1) recovery of the razor blade, article 54, persuant to the confessional statement of accused 6, admitted under section 27, Evidence Act.
We are of the opinion that the retracted judicial confession of accused 5 could not be relied upon against accused 6 in this case in view of the fact that accused 6 who had been tried alongwith accused 5 had been acquitted by the High Court of the charge of conspiracy under section 302 read with section 120B I.P.C. and accused 5 was not charged for the offence of murder of Malan for which only accused 1, 6 and 7 were tried.
Charge No. 2 framed against accused 1 to 3 was under section 302 read with section 34 I.P.C.
Mr. Rana did not draw our attention in the course of his arguments to the fact that in charge No. 1 even the approver P.W. 1 is alleged to have conspired with the seven accused to commit these three murders or contend that in view of that circumstance and the finding of the High Court that the approver P.W. 1 also was a party to the conspiracy the conviction of accused 5 alone of the charge of conspiracy under section 302 read with section 120B I.P.C. could be sustained.
The High Court considered the evidence and dismissed Criminal Appeal 38 of 1977 filed by the State for enhancement of the sentence of imprisonment for life awarded to accused 1 and 6 for the murder of Malan as also Criminal Appeal 7 of 1977 filed by accused 1 and 6 against their conviction and the sentence awarded to them.
Charge No. 1 framed in this case was for criminal conspiracy under section 302 read with section 120B I.P.C. on the allegation that between the first week of October 1975 and 2.1.1976 at Babultara and Waghala villages, all the seven accused and the approver P.W. 1.
The blade was found by the Serologist to be stained with human blood of group B like that of Malan; (2) recovery of the blood stained shirt, article 55, of accused 6 from his house; (3) evidence regarding the presence of accused 785 6 along with accused 7 and P,W. 1 near about the scene of offence before and after the commission of the murder of Malan.
Therefore, the High Court did not place any reliance on this circumstance, namely, recovery of the blood stained shirt, article 55 from the house of accused 6.
On the allegation that in pursuance of the conspiracy and in furtherance of their common intention they committed the murder of Ashamati on or about 10.11.1975.
It is the case of the prosecution that Shivram, P.W. 45 saw accused 6 under a vad tree and Abasaheb, P.W. 44, saw him in the rivulet; and (4) retracted judicial confession, Exh. 138 of accused 6.
The High Court acquitted accused 2 to 4 and convicted accused 1 alone of that charge and sentenced him, holding that he and some others had conspired together and fabricated the deed of assignment put forward by accused 1 and that accused 1 alone could not have fabricated that document.
Charge No. 3 framed against accused 1 to 4 was under section 302 read with section 34 I.P.C. on the allegation that in pursuance of the conspiracy and in furtherance of their common intention they committed the murder of Parubai on or about 29.11.1975.
Therefore, his conviction and sentence awarded to him have become final.
The Sessions Judge found, on a consideration of the evidence, all the seven accused not guilty of the charge of conspiracy framed under section 302 read with section 120B I.P.C. and acquitted them.
287 & 288 of 1980 Appeals by Special leave from the judgment and Order dated the 27th July & 8th August, 1979 of the Bombay High Court in Crl.
Sessions Case 26 of 1977 is stated to be an off shoot of what is known as the 'Manwath murders case ' in which Prakash 's father Uttamrao Barhate and his permanently kept concubine Rukmanibai and 13 others were tried for the murders of 10 girls and women during the period from 14.11.1972 to 4 11.1974 in Manwath village, Prabhani district, Maharashtra State.
Now proceed to record our reasons.
In 784 that case the charge under section 120B I.P.C. was framed against four named persons who had been arrayed as accused 1 to 4.
It was in view of this technical flaw that we allowed the appeal of accused 5 without going into the evidence regarding the merits of the case against him.
