The main diffi culty in accepting the Company 's case on this point, viz., the pronouncements of this Court, however, remained.
The workmen claim that these showed clearly a tendency in the Bombay region to fix the age of retirement in comparable concerns at 60.
429 Notice has also to be taken in this connection of the Report of the Norms Committee in which the following opinion was expressed: "After taking into consideration the views of the earlier Committees and Commissions including those of the Second Pay Commission the report of which has been released recently, we feel that the retirement age for workmen in all industries should be fixed at 60.
We ought to add in this connection, that the approach adopted by the Tribunal in dealing with this aspect of the problem is not very commendable, and that its present conclusion that what was said by itself on an earlier occasion and was confirmed by this Court in appeal, was in fact inaccurate, is on the whole unsound.
In Imperial Chemical Industries 427 (India) Private Ltd., vs The Workmen(1) where the Tribunal had raised the age of retirement from 55 to 58 and both parties appealed, this Court pointed out that one of the documents on the record "would conclusively show that in Bombay the age of retirement is almost invariably fixed at 60 and not at 55".
The very few departures from this practice which the Tribunal has mentioned are, in our opinion, wholly insufficient to indicate any slowing down of this trend.
The Chart which is marked exhibit U 5 mentions 50 concerns in which the age of retirement is 60.
In an earlier decision of this Court in Dunzlop Rubber Co. Ltd., vs Workmen(2) it had been urged that the employer was an All India concern and that changing the terms and conditions of service in regard to the age of retirement in one place might unsettle the uniformity and might have serious repercussions in other branches.
