The High Court further observed: "Poor PW 4 was compelled to speak to a version which ought to accord and harmonise with the version given out by , PWs 1, 2 and 3".
He admitted in the course of cross examination that the Sub Inspector asked him whether he had any witnesses and that he "did not tell about them due to excitement".
We are unable to say that the High Court in this case has made a correct approach in assessing the quality of the testimony of this solitary eye witness.
This is, therefore, a case where conviction of the accused depends .
He further saw his two brothers, Gnanasakaran (PW 1) and Thiru gnanasambandam (PW 3) along with Ramasamy (PW 2) chasing them.
The High Court is not even right that PW 4 stands wholly corroborated by the contents of the FIR.
It failed to notice certain broad facts which should definitely weigh with the court while appreciating ocular testimony.
This witness may not have a qualm of conscience in implicating the accused for the 711 mere asking by someone, if not by the inimical police officer (PW 23) against whom criminal cases were pending at the instance of the accused 's father.
On the other hand we find that there is a mention about a pool of blood only where the dead body was found at No. 1 in the site plan.
The very fact that this eye witness could be persuaded to substitute PWs 1, 2 and 3 for his deceased brother as chasing the assailants, degrades him from the status of an absolutely reliable witness.
When the accused is 712 going to lose his life in such a serious charge it is only necessary that the court should be circumspect and closely scrutinise the evidence to come to an unhesitating conclusion that he is absolutely reliable.
It also stands to reason that those persons who gathered would not ask PW 4, who arrived at the place a little later, for information with regard to the assailants.
