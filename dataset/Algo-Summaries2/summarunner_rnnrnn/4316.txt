Nor can it be doubted that fitment into the revised pay scales is certainly a part of the revision of pay scales.
The only contention of the workmen is that the Tribunal should have fixed the dearness allowance in communion with the cost of living index.
No second flat increase was envisaged at all.
Now, if, without any flat or ad hoc increase of salary, the workmen were to be fitted into the revised scales of pay, it would obviously result in serious anomalous situations.

The Tribunal took note of the elaborate scales of wages already existing in the wage structure of the appellant and decided "to modify the existing structure of the scales with flat increases in each category.
Since there was to be a flat increase of Rs. 150/ and Rs. 100/ in the case of draftsmen and other workmen respectively, the revised wage scale had necessarily to commence with figures Rs. 150/ and Rs. 100/ above the existing wage scales.
Therefore, they filed an application before the Tribunal for correcting the award so as to bring out what was intended.
Even so we propose to examine whether the correction sought by the employees union was within the bounds of the authority of the Tribunal or whether it was in effect a fresh award.

The addition was integrated as a feature of the wage scales; it was not regarded as an addition to the pay of each individual workman.
Civil Appeal No. 2300 of 1979 is dismissed.
Similarly, the same words "to each employee" after the figure "100" were omitted.
It is needless to recapitulate all the basic facts which have been set out in the judgment of Pathak, J. The Award of the Industrial Tribunal was made on December 20, 1978.
Thereafter the Tribunal made an order on the same day in the following terms: "There can be no doubt that a flat increase of Rs. 150/ to each of the employees in the category of Draftsmen and 181 of Rs. 100/ to each employee in the other categories has been granted under my award.
In the result, Civil Appeal No. 2299 of 1979 is allowed in part insofar that the order dated 22nd December, 1978 of the Industrial Tribunal, Maharashtra Bombay is quashed to the extent that it modifies the original award dated 20th December, 1978, and the corrigendum made consequent thereto is also quashed.
The corrigendum amending the award in consequence is liable to be quashed.
It may be mentioned that only from that point of view viz. to grant flat increase of Rs. 150/ and of Rs. 100/ to the employees in the category of Draftsmen and the other categories respectively that a burden statement was called for from the company and the same was submitted (vide exhibit C 51).
For some years to come this is likely to be one of the few Consulting Engineers who will be securing major contracts".

As it has now turned out what the employees apparently suspected the employer might contend, is precisely what the employer is not contending, though the employer did not choose to so contend before the Industrial Tribunal itself when the employees filed the application for rectification.
Nothing those facts, the Tribunal observed that compared with the increased paying capacity of the appellant, an inference drawn from the prosperity enjoyed by the appellant over the years, there was definite need for revising the wage scales.
The endorsement made on the application by the Advocate for the company does not indicate that the company had any objection to the award being corrected as sought by the employees union.
The amendment made by the Tribunal has the effect of providing a second increase, this time to each individual workmen.
On this application, the Advocate for the employer company made the following endorsement: "Submitted to whatever this Hon 'ble Tribunal desires to do".
We are not impressed with the submission of the learned counsel for the Company that the corrigendum was in effect a fresh award.
It noted that dearness allowance was being granted by the appellant at 10% of the salary subject to a minimum of Rs. 50/ and house rent allowance at 30% of the basic salary.
It was clearly so intended by the Tribunal as is evident from the reference to "flat increase of Rs. 150/ in the category of Draftsmen and Rs. 100/ in the case of the other categories".
It declared that the cumulative effect of an improved wage structure together with dearness allowance operating on a slab system would throw an impossible burden of about Rs. 1 crore on the financial capacity of the appellant.
It is wrong in principle, it is said, to provide a fixed dearness allowance.
However, this is not clearly mentioned anywhere in the award due to accidental slip or omission.
171 in this connection, it proceeded on the footing that the appellant was a separate and independent division of Tata Sons Limited and had no "functional integrality" with the other divisions.

It is not possible to maintain one part of the award and supersede another.
The Tribunal has given satisfactory reason for adopting a different mode and we are not disposed to interfere with the award of the Tribunal.
In the circumstances the order of 22nd December, 1978 is invalid so far as it amends paragraph 23 of the original award.

The primary and basic question considered by the Industrial Tribunal, in making the award dated December 20, 1978 was the question of revision of the wage scales.
The Tribunal maintained the existing schemes of dearness allowance and house rent allowance, and observed that in view of the revised basic wages there would be a resultant increase in the dearness allowance and house rent allowance.

Accordingly, the appeal filed by the workmen must fail.
In the said award, Your Honour has observed, at the end of Para 22, 'In view of the increase that is being allowed in the basic pay, I do not propose to revise the existing scheme of Dearness Allowance '.
The question is what should be the extent of such burden?" At the end of paragraph 18 of the award the Tribunal said: A" mere reading of Exhibit U 15 will immediately dispel the misgivings about the future of the present company.
Taking into account the circumstance that besides the staff of 306 workmen represented by the Union there were several other employees who would also have to be paid, the Tribunal considered it fair, in paragraph 23 of the award, to give a flat increase of Rs. 150/ in the category of Draughtsmen and Rs. 100/ in the case of other categories.
The sufficiency of the existing pay scales was considered in detail, and regard was had to their original structure and the accretions made subsequently by way of dearness allowance and house rent allowance.

Revising the figures on that basis, it computed the annual gross profits for the years 1968 to 1977 and determined the annual average at Rs. 26.69 lakhs.
We, therefore, see no ground for quashing the order dated December 22, 1978 of the Tribunal.
In the present case the Industrial Tribunal on a consideration of the material placed before it came to the conclusion that the company was in an undoubted position to bear the additional financial burden.
On the other hand the endorsement reads as if there was tacit agreement on the part of the Company to the correction sought by the union.
The financial capacity, as the Tribunal observed, constituted one of "the principles which are required to be followed in the fixation of the wage structure." A clear statement of its intention is found in paragraph 22 of the award, where the Tribunal stated: "I only propose to modify the existing structures of the scales with flat increases in each category." 176 No ad hoc increase to the pay of each individual workman was intended.
It was pointed out that the dearness allowance and house rent allowance granted by the appellant made little impact in neutralising the cost of living.
We have already indicated that we agree with our brother Pathak, J., that the appeal (Civil Appeal No. 2300 of 1979) filed by the workmen should also be dismissed.

We are unable to see how it can be held to be otherwise.
We also agree with him that Civil Appeal No. 2299 of 1979 should also be dismissed in so far as it relates to the award dated December 20, 1978.

While workmen raising industrial disputes for revision of wage scales are certainly minded about their future prospects in the matter of wages, they, surely would be more concerned with the immediate benefits according to them That was why the Industrial Tribunal thought that an all round flat increase of Rs. 150/ in the case of Draftsmen and Rs. 100/ in the case of other workmen was called for.

In travelling outside and beyond the terms of the original award, the Tribunal has committed a jurisdictional error.
In our opinion Civil Appeal No. 2299 of 1979 should be dismissed in its entirety.
Our attention has been drawn to what purports to be an endorsement by counsel for the appellant on the application dated 22nd December, 1978 filed by the Union before the Tribunal to the effect that the appellant would submit to whatever the Tribunal decided, and it is urged that the appellant is bound by the order made on the application.
