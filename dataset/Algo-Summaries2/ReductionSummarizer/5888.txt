From the Judgment and Order dated 14.4.1988 of the Patna High PG NO 867 PG NO 868 Court in C.W.J.C.
The order dated 25th March, 1988 of the Collector is under challenge in this appeal.
Samastipur is therefore placed in the black list for future under the orders passed by the Collector, Samastipur. "
This order was passed pursuant to the order of the Collector.
The letter dated 25th March, 1988, states as follows: "The Collector of the district after perusal of the said office note passed order on 25.3.88 which is produced in verbatim below: Ist bidder chunki defaulter hai atah security prapt kar len tatha bhavishya ke liae Black list karen. "
Indisputably, no notice had been given to the appellant of the proposal of black listing the appellant.
It was contended on behalf of the State Government that there was no requirement in the rule of giving any prior notice before black listing any person.
But it is an implied principle of the rule of law that any order having civil consequence should be passed only after following the PG NO 869 principles of natural justice.
It has to be realised that black listing any person in respect of business ventures has civil consequence for the future business of the person concerned in any event.
