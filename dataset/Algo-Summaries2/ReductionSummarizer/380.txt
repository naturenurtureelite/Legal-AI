This appeal raises a question as to the powers of a Custodian of Evacuee Property to cancel a lease granted by him under section 12 of the (XXXI of 1950), hereinafter referred to as the Act.
They having migrated to Pakistan, these properties were declared by a notification dated 12 9 1951 issued under section 7 of the Act as evacuee property, and under section 8(1) of the Act, they became vested in the respondent as the Custodian for the State.
On 12 2 1954 the respondent issued a notice to the appellants, Exhibit C, wherein be set out that the appellants had systematically committed breaches of the various terms on which the properties bad been leased to them, and called upon them to show cause why the lease should not be cancelled and why they should not be evicted.
On 13 2 1954 the appellants appeared before the respondent, and contended that he had no auth ority to issue the notice in question under section 12, and that it was therefore illegal.
Apprehending that the lease might be cancelled, and that they might be evicted, the appellants filed on 16 2 1954 the application out of which the present appeal arises, for a writ of certiorari for quashing the notice, Exhibit C, and for a writ of prohibition restraining the respondent from taking any further action pursuant thereto.
In support of the petition, the appellants urged that section 12 under which the respondent purported to act authorised the cancellation of only leases granted by the evacuee and not by the Custodian himself, and that no directions could be given under section 10 as it applied only to properties of the evacuee, and that by reason of the sale, the movables in question had become the property of the appel 124 980 lants.
