Such being the infra structure of the Central Health Service, the question is as to the promotional prospect of a Specialist Grade II in a teaching hospital to Specialists Grade I.
By Letter dated April 6, 1965, the Delhi Administration informed the Principal, Maulana Azad Medical College in answer to a communication made by him, that consequent upon the appointment of the appellant in Category `C ' of the Central Health Service, the Administration had no objection to designating him as Associate Professor of Radiology (ex officio) in the Maulana Azad Medical 25 College provided it was not detrimental to his normal duties as a Radiologist and no financial implications were involved.
As a result of this, the appellant has continued to hold the post of Radiologist in the Irwin Hospital which is attached to the Maulana Azad Medical College and treated as an Associate Professor of Radiology (ex officio) both by the University of Delhi as well as by the Maulana Azad Medical College.
It would therefore appear that the appellant was not only holding the post of Radiologist in the Irwin Hospital, but was also actively associated with teaching the under graduate and post graduate students as an Associate Professor of Radiology of the Maulana Azad Medical College for the M.D., D.M.R.T.
26 It appears that subsequent to his substantive appointment by the President to Specialists ' Grade with effect from September 9, 1966, the appellant was called by the Banaras Hindu University for an interview on August 7, 1972 for the post of Professor of Radiotherapy but since the post of Associate Professor of Radiotherapy in Maulana Azad Medical College was falling vacant in 1973, he did not appear for the interview.
The Government of India, Ministry of Health & Family Planning, Department of Health by its letter dated February 23, 1974 informed the Delhi Administration that the appellant could not be considered for appointment to the post of Associate Professor of Radiotherapy in the Maulana Azad Medical College inasmuch as he did not possess at least five years ' teaching experience as Reader/Assistant Professor in the concerned speciality as required under the Central Health Service (Amendment) Rules, 1966.
The Ministry of Health was of the view that although the appellant had the essential qualification prescribed for teaching post the teaching experience gained by him while holding the post of Radiologist cum Associate Professor of Radiology (ex officio) in the Irwin Hospital since October 9, 1964 cannot be taken into consideration.
The contention upon which the writ petition was based was that on a true construction of r. 8 (2A) and paragraph 3 of Annexure I to the Second Schedule, he was clearly eligible for appointment to the post of Associate Professor as he had the essential educational qualification and had also the requisite teaching experience while holding the post of Radiologist cum Associate Professor of Radiology (ex officio) in the Irwin Hospital which is a teaching hospital attached to the Maulana Azad Medical College.
1 and 2 filed a return reiterating the stand 27 taken by the Government of India in the Health Ministry that the experience gained by the appellant as an Associate Professor of Radiology (ex officio) by virtue of his holding the post of Radiologist in the Irwin Hospital cannot be taken into consideration for the purpose of determining the question of his eligibility for appointment as Associate Professor.
In support of the plea, it was averred: "The teaching experience gained by the petitioner while holding the post of Radiologist in the Irwin Hospital, New Delhi by virtue of his having ex officio status of Associate Professor of Radiotherapy from the 9th of October, 1964 cannot be counted as requisite teaching experience under the Central Health Service Rules. "
The Ministry of Health by its letter dated January 17, 1976 however informed the Secretary (Medical), Delhi Administration that it was not possible to relieve the appellant of his duties or place his services on deputation with a lien on his post as Radiologist in the Irwin Hospital, and if he wanted to join as Professor of Radiology (Radiotherapy) in the Medical College, Rohtak, he should "give up all connections with the Central Health Service".
