that notice as to why the lease should not be terminated without any compensation under the second proviso to section 20(1) of the Abolition Act.
Thereupon the Board of Revenue passed an order on December 27, 1955, declaring that the lease to the appellant had been granted subsequent to July 1, 1945, and that, as the lease was for a period exceeding one year, it was not enforceable against the Government, according to the second proviso to section 20 (1) of the Abolition Act.
The principal question canvassed before us is that the termination of the appellant 's lease by the order dated December 27, 1955, was bad as it did not give three months ' notice to the appellant or provide for any compensation as required by section 20 of the Abolition Act.
In cases not governed by sections 18 and 19, where before the notified date, a landholder has created any right in any land (whether by way of lease or otherwise) including rights in any forest, mines or minerals, quarries, fisheries or ferries, the transaction shall be deemed to be valid; and all rights and obligations arising thereunder, on or after the notified date, shall be enforceable by or against the Government: Provided that the transaction was not void or illegal under any law in force at the time: Provided further that any such right created on or after the 1st day of July 1,945 shall not be enforceable against the Government, unless it was created for a period not exceeding one year : Provided also that where such right was created for a period exceeding one year, unless it relates to the private land of the landholder within the meaning of section 3, clause (10), of the Estates Land Act, the Government may, if, in their opinion, it is in the public interest to do so, by notice given to the person concerned, terminate the right with effect from such date as may be specified in the notice, not being earlier than three months from the date thereof.
(2) The person, whose right has been terminated by the Government under the foregoing proviso, shall be entitled to compensation from the Government which shall be determined by the Board of 557 Revenue in such manner as may be prescribed, having regard to the value of the right and the unexpired portion of the period for which the right was created.
