P. C. Accordingly, we allowed the Criminal Appeal 288 of 1980 and acquitted Prakash, accused 5 and directed him to be set at liberty forthwith and dismissed Criminal Appeal 287 of 1980 filed by accused 6 and confirmed the conviction of accused 6 and the sentence awarded to him by the courts below.

We are of the opinion that the retracted judicial confession of accused 5 could not be relied upon against accused 6 in this case in view of the fact that accused 6 who had been tried alongwith accused 5 had been acquitted by the High Court of the charge of conspiracy under section 302 read with section 120B I.P.C. and accused 5 was not charged for the offence of murder of Malan for which only accused 1, 6 and 7 were tried.
The High Court considered the evidence and dismissed Criminal Appeal 38 of 1977 filed by the State for enhancement of the sentence of imprisonment for life awarded to accused 1 and 6 for the murder of Malan as also Criminal Appeal 7 of 1977 filed by accused 1 and 6 against their conviction and the sentence awarded to them.
Therefore, his conviction and sentence awarded to him have become final.
It is the case of the prosecution that Shivram, P.W. 45 saw accused 6 under a vad tree and Abasaheb, P.W. 44, saw him in the rivulet; and (4) retracted judicial confession, Exh. 138 of accused 6.

Therefore, the High Court did not place any reliance on this circumstance, namely, recovery of the blood stained shirt, article 55 from the house of accused 6.
