The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS GUPTA, J.
Shortly after this the Company 's employees at Bombay raised a dispute regarding their retirement age.
1947 the Private Limited Company was converted into a Public Limited Company.
In September, 1959 an agreement was entered into between the Company and its employees at Calcutta under which the age of retirement was extended to 58 years subject to the employees passing a medical examination on reaching the age ,of 55.
As has already been noticed there is no dispute that the age of compulsory retirement should not remain at 55.
The main diffi culty in accepting the Company 's case on this point, viz., the pronouncements of this Court, however, remained.
This appeal arises out of an industrial dispute as regards the age of retirement.
If this Court had erred in making those pronouncements we would be the first to admit such mistakes and to correct the error.
The workmen claim that these showed clearly a tendency in the Bombay region to fix the age of retirement in comparable concerns at 60.
The first respondent, Shaw Wallace & Co., was incorporated in January, 1946 as a Private Limited Company to take over the business of the partnership firm of the Shaw Wallace & Co., which had been ,doing business in India for about 60 years.
It has Branches in Bombay, Delhi and Via Madras.
This dispute was ultimately referred to the Industrial Tribunal, Maharashtra.
Appeal allowed.
There is thus good ground for thinking that the. reason why these concerns have kept the age of retirement at 55 or 58 are special to them and do not show any recent trend in the matter.
They claimed that no workman should be retired from service before he bad completed 60 years of age.
The Court then took into account the fact that the Tribunal had found that in all the awards in recent times in various concerns in Bombay region the trend had been to fix the age of retire ment at 60 years.
