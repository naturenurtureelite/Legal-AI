Section 6, sub section
The appellant said that the temple was declared as an "exempted" temple under the provisions of Madras Act 1 of 1925.
For these reasons we hold that this appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs.
(9) of Madras Act 19 of 1951 states: "In this Act, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context (9) 'hereditary trustee ' means the trustee of a religious institution succession to whose office devolves by hereditary right or is regulated by usage or is specifically provided for by the founder, so long as such scheme of succession is in force;" This Act has been substituted by Madras Act 22 of 1959 but the definition of the trustee is identical in both the Acts.
In that case Venkatasubba Rao, J. said: "If the successor owes his title to nomination or appointment, that is, his succession depends on the volition of the last incumbent and does not rest upon independent title, I am inclined to the view that the office cannot be said to be hereditary." Krishnan J., stated as follows: "Where succession is by nomination by the holder in office of his successor it seems to be impossible to contend that it is a hereditary succession.
It is now well established that the office of a hereditary trustee is in the nature of property.
In that case the custom in (1) (2) 63 I. A. 448.
The phrase "regulated by usage" in section 6(9) of the Act must be construed along with the phrase "succession to this office" and when so construed that part of the definition would only apply where the ordinary rules of succession under the Hindu law are modified by usage and succession has to be determined in accordance with the modified rules.
1954 S.C. 606.
