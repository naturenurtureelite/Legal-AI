The contestants at this election were Abhoy Pada Saha and Sudhir Kumar Mondal.
Abhoy Pada described himself in the nomination paper as "a member of the Sunri caste which is a Scheduled Caste".
These appeals arise out of an election to a seat in the West Bengal Legislative Assembly from the Khargram Murshidabad constitutency reserved for members of the Scheduled Castes.
the other must be a caste.
The objection was rejected by the Returning Officer.
This prayer, however, was rejected by the High Court.
In his petition Sudhir had further claimed that he should be declared elected in the place of the appellant if the latter 's election was found to be invalid.
At the hearing of the petition by the Election Tribunal, however, he challenged the election only on the ground that Abhoy Pada was a member of the Saha caste and not a member of a Scheduled Caste.
After all, the evidence led in a case may be imperfect.
