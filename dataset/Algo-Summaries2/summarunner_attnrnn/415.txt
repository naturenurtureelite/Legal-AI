385 4.The claim of State that no particulars of the grounds could be furnished in public interest is unsustainable and in any case mala fide.
Now it has been held in Atma Ram Sridhar Vaidya 's case(1) by the majority of the Court, that the constitutional right of a detenue under article 22(5) comprises two distinct components.
O R D E R.
In the circumstances and having regard to thefact that what is alleged is espionage activity ata time when relations between the two Governments on the affairs of Goa were somewhat delicate, we are inclined to think, with the High Court, that the grounds cannot be considered to be vague.
It is, therefore, enough to state, in its broad outlines, the background, which is alleged as follows: (1)(a) There was a sudden search by the police on the 24th August, 1954, at the appellant 's place for alleged possession of illicit liquor.which, in fact, was not found.
To appreciate the points thus raised, it is necessary to have an idea of the grounds of detention as furnished.
(b)On the same day, a search was carried out by the police also at his residence at Mahim but nothing was found.
Such a contention as to the mala fide exercise of the power is untenable in the present case having regard to the nature of the 393 grounds on which the detention is based and the nature of activities imputed therein to the appellant.
But having regard to the nature of the alleged activities of the appellant, it is not unlikely that no more could be gathered or furnished.
