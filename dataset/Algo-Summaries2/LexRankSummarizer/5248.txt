(Not present ) The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SABYASACHI MUKHARJI, J.
The appeal under section 29(1) of the (hereinafter called the Act) is directed against the judgment and order of the High Court of Allahabad dated 6th of January 1971.
The questions involved before the Allahabad High Court in the reference under section 27(1) of the Act were as follows: (1) Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal right ly held that the assessee did not make valid gifts aggregating Rs.

(3) Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal tight ly held that the sum of Rs.
1,50,000 was properly included in the assessee 's net wealth?
(4) Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal right ly held that the assessee did not make valid gifts aggregating Rs.67,560/ (5) Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal right ly held that the sum of Rs.67,560/12/ was rightly included in the net wealth of the assessee?
The case relates to the assessment year 1957 58 and the relevant date of valuation was 31st March, 1957.
The asses see, Dr. R.S.
Gupta had maintained an account in the books of Messrs. Tika Ram and Sons Pvt.
On 1st January, 1957, the account showed a credit of Rs.
1,50,740.
On that day, the assessee had addressed a letter to the Company stating that he had decided to gift away for love and affection various sums to the following persons: 125 Ved Prakash Gupta .
Rs.25,000 Om Prakash Gupta .
Rs.25,000 Hari Prakash Gupta .
Rs.50,000 Pravin Kumar Gupta .
Rs.
50,000 By that letter the assessee had directed the Company to debit his account to the extent of Rs.
1,50,000 and credit the respective amounts in the names of the aforesaid per sons.
It appears further that copies of this letter were sent to one Om Prakash Gupta and Ved Prakash Gupta.
There was no dispute that instructions of the assessee were car ried out by the Company and relevant debit and credit en tries were made in the respective accounts.
On the same day i.e. on ist January, 1957, Om Parkash Gupta wrote to the assessee, his father, thanking him for the gift of Rs.25,000 made in his favour and the gift of Rs.50,000 in favour of his son Pravin.
A similar letter was written by Ved Prakesh thanking the assessee, his father, for the gift of Rs.25,000 made to him and Rs.50,000 gifted to his son.
It must be mentioned, however, that the company i.e. Messrs Tika Ram and Sons.
Ltd. was stated to be running an oil mill and carrying on business as grain tillers.
contractors and brick kiln owners.
It was also stated to be carrying on business of advancing money and taking money on loan when necessary.
But it appears that it was admitted position that Tika Ram & Sons had a cash balance of Rs.4000 only on 1.1.1957 and it did not have any overdraft facilities with any bank.
The respective donees were stated to have later on withdrawn amounts from the amounts so transferred to their accounts.
The assessee contended that a total sum of Rs.
1,50,000 was validly gifted by him to his sons and grand sons and hence the amounts had been wrongly included in his net wealth by the Income Tax Officer and the Appellate Assistant Commissioner.
It was his contention that Tika Ram & Sons carried on the business of banking and hence the gifts were valid.
But there was no evidence that Tika Ram and Sons were carrying on any banking business.
The Tribunal held that they were not carrying on banking business.
The main question therefore that falls for consid eration is whether gifts in question made by transfer en tries in the books of debtor company were valid gifts even though the debtor company was not carrying on business of banking and had no cash in hand for the amount in question on that date.
Gift is defined in section 122 of the as transfer of certain existing mova ble or immovable property made voluntarily and without consideration by 126 one person, called the donor, to another, called the donee, and accepted by or on behalf of the donee.
Section 123 of the said Act deals with how transfers are effected and stipulates, inter alia, that for the purpose of making a gift of movable property as in this case, the transfer must be effected either by a registered instrument signed by the donor and attested or by delivery.
Such delivery may be made in the same way as goods sold may be delivered.
The next contention was regarding the inclusion of net wealth a sum of Rs.67,560/12/ standing to the credit of the assessee in the books of M/s Pearls & Beads.
The assessee claimed to have gifted the said amounts by transfer entries in the books of M/s Pearls & Beads on 30th March, 1957.
No letter as in the previous case was addressed by the assessee but only oral instructions were said to have been given.
The Tribunal held that there was no valid gifts.
There was no evidence, it appears, that the said sum was available with the said firm of M/s Pearls & Beads.
The High Court in view of the decision of the Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court in the case of Gopal Raj Swarup vs Commissioner of Wealth tax, Lucknow, answered the first question in the negative and so far as the second question is concerned, it declined to answer as it did not arise in view of the answer given to the first question and the questions Nos.
3,4 and 5 were answered in the negative.
Aggrieved by the said decision, the revenue has come up in appeal.
In order to constitute a valid gift there must be an existing property.
