Appeals Nos.
Appeals from the judgment and decree dated May 2, 1960, of the Rajasthan High Court in Civil Second Appeal Nos.
268 of 1954, 203 of 1955, 4 of 1954 and 27 of 1954. section K. Kapur and B. R. G. K. Achar, for the appellant 'in allthe appeals).
These four appeals arise out of four certi ficates granted by the High Court of Rajasthan and raise a common question.
The suit out 'of which appeal No.
887 has arisen was filed by the respondent against the State of Rajasthan.
The respondent was a resident of the former Dholpur State and the dispute which led to the suit related to a time before the merger of former Dholpur State into the Matsya Union.
The case of the respondent was that in 1947 certain commodities including chuni with which appeal No.
887 is concerned could only be exported from the former Dholpur State on export permits issued by the customs department of the said State.
Consequently, in June 1947 the respondent applied for and was granted a permit for export of 15,000 maunds of chuni, and in connection therewith he deposited Rs.
30,000/as export duty in advance.
The respondent however was not able to export the entire quantity of 15,000 maunds for which the permit was granted; he could only export 4,572 maunds and 20 seers of chuni before December 2, 1947.
The respondent 's case further was that as he could not export the entire quantity of 15,000 maunds for which he had paid export duty in advance at the rate of Rs.
2/ per maund, he was entitled to refund of the proportionate export duty for the quantity of 10,427 maunds and 20 seers, which he could not export.
By May 15, 1949, the United State of Rajasthan was formed including the Matsya Union into which the former State of Dholpur had merged on March 17, 1948.
The United State of Rajasthan eventually became the Part B State of Rajasthan on January 26, 1950 when the Constitution came into force.
Eventually when the State refused to refund the amount, the suit was filed, out of which appeal No.
The respondent claimed refund of Rs.
The suits were resisted by the State of Rajasthan on various grounds; but we are concerned now only with one ground which alone has been urged before us, namely, that the State of Rajasthan was not bound by any liability which might have arisen against the former State of Dholpur.
As the United State of Raja sthan into which the former State of Dholpur came to be merged in 1949 never recognised the obligations of the former State of Dholpur it was not bound to refund the amount due to the respondents.
In reply to this contention of the State, the respondent relied on article 295(2) of the Constitution and other provisions made during the period when mergers were taking place after August 15, 1947 and contended that in view of article 295(2) of the Constitution the State of Rajasthan was bound by the obligation of the former State of Dholpur.
It is not in dispute that on this merger, provision was made for the continuance of the laws in the covenanting State till such time as they were modified by the new State.
