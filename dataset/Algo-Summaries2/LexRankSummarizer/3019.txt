448 This is an appeal by the Union of India by way of special leave.
On April 9, 1959, the Central Government directed removal from service of Capt.
section K. Rao under r. 14 of the Army Rules, 1954.
It was alleged that on April 4, 1958, he committed acts of .gross misconduct.
The allegations were as follows : "Knowing Kumari Prakash as the daughter of a brother Officer, Rao assisted her in going away from her parents protection and planning to run away with a sepoy. "
"Rao, by threatening to cause harm to Kumari Prakash 's parents, intimidated her t o visit his house where he took her in his scooter to the unit lines of 51 1 1 Gurkha Rifles where he arranged her meeting with a sepoy of the unit."
"He (i.e. Rao) acquiesced in the girl being met by the sepoy later at a tea shop nearby where she received a present of a sari and blouse from the sepoy in his presence."
"Rao thus actively abetted in the attempt of brother officer 's daughter elope with a sepoy."
