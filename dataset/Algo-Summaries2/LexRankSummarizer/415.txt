Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated the 9th August 1955 of the Bombay High Court in Criminal Application No.
M. R. Parpia, J.
This is an appeal by special leave against the judgment of the High Court of Bombay dismissing an application made to it under article 226 of the Constitution.
These proceedings relate to the validity of an order of detention passed by the Government of Bombay on the 8th June, 1955, against the appellant before us, who is an Advocate of the High Court of Bombay having a standing of about thirty years.
He was in the Indian Air Force as an emergency Commissioned Officer between 1943 to 1948 and thereafter on extension for another four years until he attained the age of 55.
Political and Services Department, Secretariat, Bombay, 8th June, 1955.
By Order and in the name of the Governor of Bombay.
Under Secretary to the Government of Bombay.
1.The order of detention was mala fide.
The grounds of detention are vague.
385 4.The claim of State that no particulars of the grounds could be furnished in public interest is unsustainable and in any case mala fide.
This part of the argument raises, what ultimately are questions of fact which have been fully considered by the High Court.
The above high handed action of the police, by way of search and seizure, was the subject matter of challenge by the appellant by means of a writ application in the High Court in which the police officers concerned filed affidavits virtually admitting the appellant 's allegations relating to seizure of papers, etc.
But on appeal, filed by the appellant, before the Sessions Judge, the conviction was set aside and retrial ordered.
