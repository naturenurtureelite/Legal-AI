701 A. V. Viswanatha Sastri, J.
October, 23.
The judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR, J.
These a peals pursuant to a certificate of the High Court of Bombay raise the question of interpretation of section 24B of the Income tax Act in an Income tax Reference.
The question referred was answered in the negative and against the Commissioner of Income tax who is the appellant in these appeals, the respondents being the heirs and legal representatives of one Amarchand N. Shroff deceased.
The appeals relate to the assessment years 1950 51, 1951 52, 1952 53, 1953 54 and 1954 55.
Shortly stated the facts of the case are these Amarchand N. Shroff, Mangaldas and Hiralal were partners in a firm of solicitors.
Amarchand died on July 7, 1949.
Thereafter the partnership was carried on by Mangaldas and Hiralal up to November 30, 1949, and on December 1, 1949, Ramesh son of Amarchand who had by then qualified as a solicitor joined the firm as the third partner.
After the death of Amarchand the arrangement between the various partners in regard to the realisations of the old outstandings was that in respect of the work done up to the death of Amarchand the realisations were to be divided amongst Amarchand, Mangaldas and Hiralal, in respect of the work between July 8, 1949, and November 30, 1919, the realisations were to be divided between Mangaldas and Hiralal 'and in respect of work done after December 1, 1949, the realisations were to be divided amongst Mangaldas, Hiralal and Ramesh.
The firm kept its accounts on cash basis.
For the five assessment years 1950 51 to 1954 55 the following amounts were received : Rs.
43,162/ , Rs.
34,899/ , Rs.
13,402/ and 702 Rs.
32,523/ by the heirs and legal representatives of Amarchand out of the outstandings.
The Income tax Officer sought to tax these realisations.
For the assessment years 1950 51 and 1951 52 he assessed the amounts in the hands of the heirs and legal representatives of Amarchand as a Hindu undivided family.
Against that order an appeal was taken to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and then to the Appellate Tribunal.
The two members of the Tribunal agreed in holding, though for different reasons, that the amounts were not the income of the Hindu undivided family but merely represented inheritance or realisations of the assets of Amarchand.
The matter was not pursued further by the Revenue but sometime later proceedings were started by the Income tax Officer under section 34 in respect of the same income in the hands of "Amarchand N. Shroff by his heirs and legal representatives".
The status of that entity was taken to be that of an individual and not Hindu undivided family.
