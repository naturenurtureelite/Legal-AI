Civil Appeal No.
From the Judgment and order dated 29.9.1986 of the Allahabad High Court in C.R.
Shanker Ghosh and P K. Jain for the Appellants.
Chitale.
Madan Lokur, Prashant Bhushan, Beni Parshad, Rajinder Dhawan and Jitendra Sharma for the Respondents.
This appeal arises out of a judgment passed by the High Court of Allahabad in Civil Revision No.
83 of 1986 wherein the learned Judge of the High Court allowed the revision petition set aside the judgment and decree of the Trial Judge and decreed the plaintiff suit for ejectment of the appellant.
The trial court therefore dismissed the suit.
The High Court set aside this conclusion of the trial court.
The main ground which was before the High Court was as to whether the provisions of U.P.
Urban Buildings (Regulation of Letting, Rent and Eviction) Act, 1972 ( 'Act ' for short) will be applicable to these proceedings in view of the fact that although the premises were let out in June 1976 but as the assessment was made on October 1, 1976 the provisions of the Act referred to above will not apply for 10 years from October 1, 1976 and therefore the suit could be decreed as the protection available under this Act will not be available to the tenant.
High Court after discussing various decisions came to the conclusion that in view of the language of Section 2 sub clause 2 Explanation 1, it could not be doubted that period of 10 years will commence from 160 the date of assessment i.e. October 1, 1976 that it is in that view of the matter that the learned Judge of the High Court decreed the suit and hence the present appeal.
