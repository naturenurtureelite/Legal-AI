Civil Appeal No. 3909 of 1986.
From the Judgment and order dated 29.9.1986 of the Allahabad High Court in C.R. No. 83 of 1986.
Shanker Ghosh and P K. Jain for the Appellants.
In this view of the matter therefore the appeal is without any substance and is dismissed.
It is true that we maintained the decree for eviction passed by the High Court but in view of the fact that as the appellant has been carrying out the business in the premises for a long time for it would be proper to permit the appellant time to make their arrangements for shifting.
We therefore direct that the decree for eviction shall not be executed upto 3 1st March, 1988 on the appellant filing a usual undertaking within four weeks.
In default the respondent shall be entitled to execute the decree forthwith.
In the circumstances of the case parties are directed to bear their own costs.
Madan Lokur, Prashant Bhushan, Beni Parshad, Rajinder Dhawan and Jitendra Sharma for the Respondents.
This appeal arises out of a judgment passed by the High Court of Allahabad in Civil Revision No. 83 of 1986 wherein the learned Judge of the High Court allowed the revision petition set aside the judgment and decree of the Trial Judge and decreed the plaintiff suit for ejectment of the appellant.
The disputed property was let out on June 25, 1976.
The accommodation was for the first time assessed for house tax by the Nagar Palika Ghaziabad with effect from October 1, 1976.
The suit was filed for eviction after termination of tenancy before the trial court and objection was raised that as the shop and the basement were separately let out the tenancy could not be terminated by a single notice that would be invalid.
The trial court therefore dismissed the suit.
The High Court set aside this conclusion of the trial court.
