PG NO 290 PG NO 291 High Court in W.P. (C) No. 4211 of 1983.
Gopal Subramanium and Mrs. section Dikshit for the Appellants.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by JAGANNATHA SHETTY, J.
This appeal by special leave is from a judgment of the High Court of Allahabad dated November 6, 1985 passed in Civil Misc.
Writ Petition No. 4211 of 1983.
The appeal raises a question of considerable importance.
The question is whether it is permissible to have two pay scales in the same cadre for persons having same duties and having same responsibilities.
The High Court has answered the question in the negative.
It is said that it would be violative of the Constitutional right of "equal pay for equal work".
The facts are not in dispute.
They will be found correctly stated in the judgment under appeal and may briefly be stated thus: Prior to 1965, in the High Court of Allahabad, Bench Secretaries were on a higher pay scale than that of Section Officers.
They were in the pay scale of Rs. 160 320 as against the pay scale of Rs. 120 300 to Section Officers.
In 1965 the State Government appointed a Pay Rationalisation Committee with wide ranging reference.
The Committee was asked to consider the duties and responsibilities of different categories of posts.
It was required to consider and recommend changes to reduce the number of then existing pay scales.
It was also asked to recommend as far as possible equal emoluments for identical duties and responsibilities.
The Committee submitted a detailed report, in which Bench Secretaries became casualties.
The Committee recommended for them a pay scale slightly lower than that of Section Officers.
Rs. 150 350 was recommended for Bench Secretaries as against Rs.200 400 for Section Officers.
The State Government accepted the recommendations.
The report was in fact very much against them.
The following remarks of the Pay Commission would be pertinent: "9 Bench Secretaries (Sakna Suchiv) A memorandum from the Bench Secretaries given to us states that the post which are at present in the scale of Rs. 100 450 are of a great responsibility for which experience and special qualifications are required.
They have claimed that their duties are equivalent to Private Secretaries of Hon 'ble Judges and have demanded the same pay scale which is given to Private Secretaries and the Section Officers.
The Registrar of the High Court while forwarding the memorandum has suggested that they should also be given the same pay scale which is given to Superintendents i.e. Rs.515 40 715 or to the Section Officers i.e. Rs.350 750.
It is not necessary to emphasise that in comparison to Bench Secretaries, the Section Officers of the secretariat has to bear more responsibilities in their Section and have to control over its subordinates.
Section Officers have to prepare a lengthy and original notes in complicated and important matters.
Therefore, the responsibilities of the two posts cannot be said to be equal.
Keeping in view the present scale of pay.
the pay scale recommended by the Pay Rationalisation Committee, the nature of duties and responsibilities and the fact that every Hon 'ble Judge will have one Private Secretary in the scale of Rs.500 1,000 we feel that the Bench Secretaries cannot be given the same scale of pay which is being given to Superintendents or the Section Officers.
" It will be seen that the Pay Commission refused to equate Bench Secretaries with Section Officers in view of their differential duties.
It was found that the nature PG NO 293 of work of Section Officers was quite different and more onerous than that of Bench Secretaries.
Section Officers have to bear more responsibilities in their Sections.
They have to exercise control over their subordinate.
They have to prepare lengthy original notes in complicated matters.
The Commission, therefore, recommended Rs.400 750 for Bench Secretaries and Rs.500 1,000 to Section Officers.
The Bench Secretaries again moved the Government reiterating their demand.
The Government appears to have received several such representations against the report of Ali Zahir Commission.
To consider all such grievances.
a Committee called the "Anomalies Committee was constituted.
As the name itself suggests, the Committee was required to examine and remove anomalies in the recommendations of Pay Commission.
The Committee appears to have made some patch work.
So far as Bench Secretaries are concerned, the Committee suggested: "(1) For this post the recommendations made by the Pay Commission need not have any amendments.
(2) It should be appropriate for the Bench Secre taries to accept 10 promotional posts in the pay scale of Rs.500 1,000 as recommended by the Pay Commission.
" The Anomalies Committee also thus rejected the claim of Bench Secretaries for placing them at par with Section Officers.
It however, suggested that ten posts of Bench Secretaries should be upgraded and placed in the pay scale of Rs.500 1,000 The Government accepted that recommendation and issued an order dated July 2,1976 The order inter alia states: Judicial (High Court) Section, Lucknow dated 2nd July, 1976.
Sub: Implementation of decision and proposals of Sub Committee of the Cabinet constituted to consider the anomalies pointed out in the pay scales recommended by the U.P.
