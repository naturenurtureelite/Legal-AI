this appeal is directed against the final judgment and order dated 03 10 2007 passed by the high court of judicature andhra pradesh at hyderabad in criminal appeal no 436 of 2001 whereby the high court dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant herein and confirmed the judgment dated 19 03 2001 passed by the special judge c b i cases visakhapatnam in c c no 2 of 1998.
thereafter pw 1 made a representation to his senior officer requesting him for posting at vijayawada cheerala vetapalam or tenali.
later pw 1 was transferred to vijayawada.
as the appellant accused was dealing with the transfers the complainant pw 1 met him on 05 11 1997 at his office to pursue about the issuance of the said transfer order.
13 11 1997when he met the appellant accused he informed him that his request for transfer has been processed and the order is ready and the same has been placed before the a p o for signature and asked him to come on the next day i e on 14 11 1997and demanded rs 200 for releasing the said office order.
on 14 11 1997a trap was laid by the cbi officials along with panchas and when the accused demanded and accepted a sum of rs 200 as illegal gratification he was caught red handed along with the money which was recovered from the right hand side pocket of his pant.
rc 20a97 vsp after recording the statements of the witnesses inspector of police cbi visakhapatnam filed charge sheet being no 298 ytr dated 29 04 1998 against the appellant accused for an offence punishable under sections 7131dii read with s 132 of the prevention of corruption act1988 hereinafter referred to as the act in the court of special judge for cbi cases at visakhapatnam.
read with s 132 of the act.
on 28 01 2008this court consisting of three honourable judges issued notice in this matter confining to the quantum of sentence only.
the trial court ordered that both the sentences of imprisonment shall run concurrently.
the said conviction and sentence was affirmed by the high court.
if we confine ourselves to the limited extent of notice dated 28 01 2008we have to hear both sides only on the quantum of sentence.
however mr rangaramanujam learned senior counsel for the appellant by drawing our attention to the recent judgment of this court in yomeshbhai pranshankar bhatt vs state of gujarat2011 6 scc 312 2011 indlaw sc 370submitted that in spite of limited notice this court while exercising jurisdiction u art 142 of the constitution in order to do complete justice while hearing the matter finally can go into the merits of the orders passed by the trial court and the high court.
in the reported case the appeal was against the concurrent finding of both the courts convicting the appellant u s 302 ipc and sentencing him to suffer imprisonment for life.
the question whether the court will enlarge the scope of its inquiry at the time of final hearing depends on the facts and circumstances of the case.
since in the facts of this case we find that the appellant should be heard on all points we have come to the aforesaid conclusion.
quantum of sentence.
he fairly admitted that out of the maximum period of one year the appellant had served only 52 days in prison.
with this factual position let us consider whether the request of the learned senior counsel for the appellant is to be accepted and sentence be reduced to the period already undergone.
s 7 of the act relates to public servant taking gratification other than legal remuneration in respect of an official act.
s 13 deals with criminal misconduct by a public servant.
for clarity we reproduce the said section hereunder criminal misconduct by a public servant  1.
it is useful to refer that in the prevention of corruption act1947 the same criminal misconduct which is available in s 13 of the 1988 act had been dealt with in s 5 of the 1947 act.
other circumstances pleaded for reduction of sentence.
in order to substantiate the claim with the regard to the above learned senior counsel for the appellant has relied on the decision of this court in bechaarbhai s prajapati vs state of gujarat2008 11 scc 163 2008 indlaw sc 297 and based on the same requested this court to modify the sentence to the extent of period already undergone.
it is true that even in the cited decision the appellant accused demanded only rs 250 and it was paid and accepted.
the appellant therein was convicted for offence u s 72 of the act and appeal before the high court was also dismissed.
thereafter the same was challenged before this court.
since the appellant therein was convicted only u s 7 and s 161 cr.
after a gap of 14 years there is no need to retain the same sentence and the court is not justified in directing the appellant to serve the remaining period after such a long time.
about the request based on delay that the appellant has lost his job undergone the ordeal all along etc a lenient view be taken in this case it is useful to refer decision of this court in state of m p vs.
shambhu dayal.
indlaw sc 716 wherein it was held that it is difficult to accept the prayer of the respondent that a lenient view be taken in this case.
it has spread everywhere.
no facet of public activity has been left unaffected by the stink of corruption.
large scale corruption retards the nation building activities and everyone has to suffer on that count.
art 142 and its applicability.
by drawing our attention to art 142 of the constitution of india learned senior counsel for the appellant vehemently submitted that in order to do complete justice this court has ample power to reduce the sentence even to the extent of period already undergone or any other order which would be beneficial to the parties approaching this court.
similar claim based on art 142 has been negatived in several decisions by this court we need to refer only the latest decision of this court in manish goel vs rohini goel2010 4 scc 393 2010 indlaw sc 301 the facts in that case are that the parties by persuasion of the family members and friends entered into a compromise and prepared a memorandum of understanding dated 13 11 2009in the proceedings pending before the mediation centre delhi by which they agreed on terms and conditions incorporated therein to settle all their disputes and also for dissolution of their marriage.

speaking for the bench one of us dr.

the said power is not vested with any other court.
however we have also noticed various judgments of this court taking a contrary view to the effect that in case the legal ground for grant of divorce is missing exercising such power tantamounts to legislation and thus transgression of the powers of the legislature which is not permissible in law vide chetan dass v kamla devi 2001 4 scc 250 2001 indlaw sc 20206 and vishnu dutt sharma.

the power u art 142 of the constitution is a constitutional power and hence not restricted by statutory enactments.
though the supreme court would not pass any order u art 142 of the constitution which would amount to supplanting substantive law applicable or ignoring express statutory provisions dealing with the subject at the same time these constitutional powers can not in any way be controlled by any statutory provisions.
the power is to be used sparingly in cases which can not be effectively and appropriately tackled by the existing provisions of law or when the existing provisions of law can not bring about complete justice between the parties.
emphasis added.
in mota ram vs state of haryana2009 12 scc 727 2009 indlaw sc 682this court while reiterating the above principles has concluded that art 142 can not be exercised to negate the statutory provisions.
art 142 of the constitution vests unfettered independent jurisdiction to pass any order in public interest to do complete justice if exercise of such jurisdiction is not be contrary to any express provision of law.
the very nature of the power must lead the court to set limits for itself within which to exercise those powers and ordinarily it can not disregard a statutory provision governing a subject except perhaps to balance the equities between the conflicting claims of the litigating parties by ironing out the creases in a cause or matter before it.
in kalyan chandra sarkar v rajesh ranjan 2005 3.
scc 284 2005 indlaw sc 93this court after reiterating that this court in exercise of its jurisdiction u art 142 of the constitution would not pass any order which would amount to supplanting substantive law applicable to the case or ignoring express statutory provisions dealing with the subject observed as follows.
powers also exist independent of the statutes with a view to do complete justice between the parties and are in the nature of supplementary powers.
and may be put on a different and perhaps even wider footing than ordinary inherent powers of a court to prevent injustice.
u art 142 of the constitution would not ordinarily direct quashing of a case involving crime against the society particularly.
we have perused those orders.
long delay in disposal of appeal or any other factor may not be a ground for reduction of sentence particularly when the statute prescribes minimum sentence.
in other cases where no such minimum sentence is prescribed it is open to the court to consider the delay and its effect and the ultimate decision.
in a case of corruption by public servant quantum of amount is immaterial.
h the power u art 142 of the constitution is a constitutional power and not restricted by statutory enactments.
however this court would not pass any order u art 142 which would amount to supplant the substantive law applicable or ignoring statutory provisions dealing with the subject.
in other words acting under article 142this court can not pass an order or grant relief which is totally inconsistent or goes against the substantive or statutory enactments pertaining to the case.
consequently the appeal fails and the same is dismissed.
