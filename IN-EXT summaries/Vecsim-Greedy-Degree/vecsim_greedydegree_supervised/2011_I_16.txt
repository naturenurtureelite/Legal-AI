this appeal is directed against the final judgment and order dated 03 10 2007 passed by the high court of judicature andhra pradesh at hyderabad in criminal appeal no 436 of 2001 whereby the high court dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant herein and confirmed the judgment dated 19 03 2001 passed by the special judge c b i cases visakhapatnam in c c no 2 of 1998.
brief facts a the appellant accused was working as a head clerk in the traffic cadre section in the office of the senior divisional personnel officer south central railway vijayawada during the period from april1992 to november1997 the nature of duties of the appellant accused included dealing with and processing of the matters like promotions transfers seniority list roster list pay fixation on promotions retirements resignations etc of the personnel.
one k rama rao the complainant who was examined as pw 1was posted as yard points man grade a under station superintendent south central railway tanuku from december1995 to june1997 in june1997due to excess staff at tanuku.
he was instructed to report at head quarters vijayawada and accordingly when he reported there he was asked to go back to tanuku.
as the appellant accused was dealing with the transfers the complainant pw 1 met him on 05 11 1997 at his office to pursue about the issuance of the said transfer order.
again a day after i e on.
13 11 1997when he met the appellant accused he informed him that his request for transfer has been processed and the order is ready and the same has been placed before the a p o for signature and asked him to come on the next day i e on 14 11 1997and demanded rs 200 for releasing the said office order.
an fir was registered by the inspector cbi visakhapatnam branch in crime No.
g against the said order the appellant accused filed criminal appeal no 436 of 2001 before the high court of andhra pradesh.
the high court by impugned judgment dated 03 10 2007 dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant accused and confirmed the conviction passed by the trial court.
hence the appellant accused has preferred this appeal by way of special leave petition before this court.
heard mr atm rangaramanujam learned senior counsel for the appellant and mr harish chandra learned senior counsel for the respondent.
as stated in the narration of facts the appellant was convicted u s 7 of the act for which he was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months and to pay a fine of rs 500 in default simple imprisonment for one month.
he was also convicted for the offence under s 131dii read with s 132 of the act and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year and fine of rs 500 in default simple imprisonment for one month.
however mr rangaramanujam learned senior counsel for the appellant by drawing our attention to the recent judgment of this court in yomeshbhai pranshankar bhatt vs state of gujarat2011 6 scc 312 2011 indlaw sc 370submitted that in spite of limited notice this court while exercising jurisdiction u art 142 of the constitution in order to do complete justice while hearing the matter finally can go into the merits of the orders passed by the trial court and the high court.
in the reported case the appeal was against the concurrent finding of both the courts convicting the appellant u s 302 ipc and sentencing him to suffer imprisonment for life.
at the slp stage this court by order dated 27 07 2009issued notice confined only to the question as to whether the petitioner was guilty of commission of an offence under any of the parts of s 304 indian penal code1860 in short ipc and not u s 302 ipc similar request was made before the bench that the appellant was entitled to urge all the questions including his right to urge that he should have been acquitted in the facts and circumstances of the case.
after permitting the appellant therein to argue the case for acquittal on merits it observed we however make it clear that this can not be a universal practice in all cases.
emphasis supplied.
as a matter of fact the last sentence in para 18 makes it clear that in the facts and circumstances of that case they permitted the appellants to urge all points on merits.
the high court as an appellate court once again analysed all the material discussed the oral and documentary evidence and finding that the prosecution had proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt concurred with the conclusion arrived at by the trial court and dismissed the appeal of the appellant.
he fairly admitted that out of the maximum period of one year the appellant had served only 52 days in prison.
it is not in dispute that the provisions of the prevention of corruption act1988 alone are applicable since the incident occurred on 14 11 1997 i e subsequent to the act.
if the said offence charge is proved the court has no other option but to impose sentence of imprisonment which shall be not less than six months but which may extend to five years and also liable to fine.
for clarity we reproduce the said section hereunder criminal misconduct by a public servant  1.
however proviso to sub s 2 of s 5 gives power to the court that for any special reasons to be recorded in writing impose a sentence of imprisonment of less than one year.
finally the special judge framed charges for offence punishable under sections 712131d read with s 132 of the act.
after a gap of 14 years there is no need to retain the same sentence and the court is not justified in directing the appellant to serve the remaining period after such a long time.
accordingly we reject the said contention.
about the request based on delay that the appellant has lost his job undergone the ordeal all along etc a lenient view be taken in this case it is useful to refer decision of this court in state of m p vs.
it has spread everywhere.
as has been aptly observed in swatantar singh v state of haryana1997 4 scc 14 1997 indlaw sc 1061corruption is corroding like cancerous lymph nodes the vital veins of the body politics social fabric of efficiency in the public service and demoralising the honest officers.
art 142 and its applicability.
by drawing our attention to art 142 of the constitution of india learned senior counsel for the appellant vehemently submitted that in order to do complete justice this court has ample power to reduce the sentence even to the extent of period already undergone or any other order which would be beneficial to the parties approaching this court.
however the court rejected the said application vide order dated 01 12 2009 observing that the court was not competent to waive the required statutory period of six months under the act and such a waiver was permissible only under the directions of the supreme court as held by this court in anil kumar jain vs maya jain2009.

7 scc 734 2008 indlaw sc 1077 however these are the cases where this court came to rescue the parties on the ground for divorce not provided for by the legislature in the statute.
however we have also noticed various judgments of this court taking a contrary view to the effect that in case the legal ground for grant of divorce is missing exercising such power tantamounts to legislation and thus transgression of the powers of the legislature which is not permissible in law vide chetan dass v kamla devi 2001 4 scc 250 2001 indlaw sc 20206 and vishnu dutt sharma.
generally no court has competence to issue a direction contrary to law nor can the court direct an authority to act in contravention of the statutory provisions.

ameerbi 2007 11 scc 681 2006.
despite an extraordinary constitutional jurisdiction contained in art 142 of the constitution of india this court ordinarily would not pass an order which would be in contravention of a statutory provision.
however it is to be made clear that this power can not be used to supplant the law applicable to the case.
emphasis added.
after saying so the court rejected the request of the parties to waive the statutory period of six months under the act.
in mota ram vs state of haryana2009 12 scc 727 2009 indlaw sc 682this court while reiterating the above principles has concluded that art 142 can not be exercised to negate the statutory provisions.
art 142 of the constitution vests unfettered independent jurisdiction to pass any order in public interest to do complete justice if exercise of such jurisdiction is not be contrary to any express provision of law.
in supreme court bar association v union of india 1998 4 scc 409.
1998 indlaw sc 688this court observed the supreme court in exercise of its jurisdiction u art 142 has the power to make such order as is necessary for doing complete justice between the parties in any cause or matter pending before it.
indeed this court is not a court of restricted jurisdiction of only dispute settling.

and may be put on a different and perhaps even wider footing than ordinary inherent powers of a court to prevent injustice.
in a case of corruption by public servant quantum of amount is immaterial.
merely because the delinquent lost his job due to conviction under the act may not be a mitigating circumstance for reduction of sentence particularly when the statute prescribes minimum sentence.
an order which this court can make in order to do complete justice between the parties must not only be consistent with the fundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution but also it can not even be inconsistent with the substantive provisions of the relevant statute.
in other words this court can not altogether ignore the substantive provisions of a statute.
g in exercise of the power u art 142 of the constitution this court generally does not pass an order in contravention of or ignoring the statutory provisions nor is the power exercised merely on sympathy.
h the power u art 142 of the constitution is a constitutional power and not restricted by statutory enactments.
however this court would not pass any order u art 142 which would amount to supplant the substantive law applicable or ignoring statutory provisions dealing with the subject.
i the powers u art 142 are not meant to be exercised when their exercise may come directly in conflict with what has been expressly provided for in statute dealing expressly with the subject.
consequently the appeal fails and the same is dismissed.
appeal dismissed.
