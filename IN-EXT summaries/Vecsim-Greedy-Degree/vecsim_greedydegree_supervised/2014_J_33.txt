in a situation like in the present case one can not hold of any statute entitling the auction purchasers to claim interest in case the auction got cancelled or set aside by the court of law.
counsel for the parties also could not refer any of the clauses of auction prescribing interest on refund of amount in case of cancellation of auction or sale.
the question arises as to whether in such a situation an auction purchaser can claim interest on equitable ground.
in state of maharashtra and others vs maimuma banu and others2003 7 scc 448 2003 indlaw sc 625the question arose as to whether interest was payable on rental compensation.
in the said case government resolution provided for payment of rental compensation expeditiously but no provision was made to pay interest in case of delayed payment.
11 it is not in dispute that in certain cases payments have already been made.
though the inevitable conclusion is that the high court is not justified in directing grant of interest on the logic of various provisions contained in the act yet there is an element of equity in favour of the landowners.
6 from 1 4 2000 till amounts payable as rental compensation are paid to the landowners concerned.
in the present case we find that there was no mis representation on the part of the auction purchasers they deposited the total auction amount within the time stipulated.
it has not been in dispute that the title of the land was also transferred in their favour.
but for the reasons mentioned by the high court the sale has been cancelled.
taking into consideration the aforesaid factor while working out equities it would therefore be appropriate to direct the state to pay interest at the rate of 6 on the amount to be refunded as per the high court s order with effect from 27th april2001 and 3rd.
september2001the day the high court passed the impugned order.
c a nos 6169 6171 of 2013c a nos 6172 6174 of 2013c a no 7122 of 2003c a nos 7123 7124 of 2003c a no 7125 of 2003 are allowed in terms of the directions as above.
