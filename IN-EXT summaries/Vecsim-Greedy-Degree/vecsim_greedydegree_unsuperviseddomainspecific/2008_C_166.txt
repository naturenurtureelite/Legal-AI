leave granted.
challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a division bench of the madhya pradesh high court dismissing the writ appeal filed by the appellant on the ground that it was not maintainable.
hereinafter referred to as the act it was held that the order was passed in exercise of power of superintendence u art 227 of the constitution of india1950 in short the constitution against which the letters patent appeal is not maintainable.
additionally it is submitted that the prayer in the writ petition was to quash the order passed by the assistant commissioner commercial tax.
it is the nature of the relief sought for and the controversy involved which determines the article which is applicable.
a bare reading of the order shows that the direction was to consider the lpa on merits and time was granted to prefer the lpa within three weeks.
on that score alone the high court s order is unsustainable.
in addition the high court seems to have gone by the nomenclature gone by the nomenclature i e the discription given in the writ petition to be one u art 227 of the constitution.
an appeal shall lie from a judgment or order passed by the one judge of the high court in exercise of original jurisdiction u art 226 of the constitution of india to a division bench comprising of two judges of the same high court.

it was noted as follows.
as seen above under rules 1 and 17applications u arts 226 and 227 are required to be heard and disposed of by a division bench.
as we have seen above an intra court appeal against the judgment of a single judge in a petition u art 226 is not barred while cl 15 itself bars an intra court appeal against the judgment of a single judge in a petition u art 227.

dinkar kashinath watve 1989 indlaw sc 421c a no 520 of 1989 decided on 27 1 1989 held as follows even when in the cause title of an application both art 226 and art 227 of the constitution have been mentioned the learned single judge is at liberty to decide according to facts of each particular case whether the said application ought to be dealt with only u art 226 of the constitution.
for determining the question of maintainability of an appeal against such a judgment of the single judge the division bench has to find out whether in substance the judgment has been passed by the learned single judge in exercise of the jurisdiction u art 226 of the constitution.
in the event in passing his judgment on an application which had mentioned in its cause title both arts 226 and 227the single judge has in fact invoked only his supervisory powers under article 227the appeal under cl 15 would not lie.
even when the learned single judge s order has been passed under both the articles for deciding the maintainability against such an order what would be relevant is the principal or main relief granted by the judgment passed by learned single judge and not the ancillary directions given by him.
in the present case the division bench was clearly wrong in holding that the appeal was not maintainable against the order of the learned single judge.
after taking the aforesaid view one course open was to set aside the order of the division bench and to remand the matter for being disposed of on merits by the division bench of the high court.
however taking in view the fact that this litigation is going on for nearly a decade and also the fact that even the learned single judge in his impugned order dated december 111987 had remanded the case to the rent controller we considered it proper in the interest of justice to hear the appeal on merits against the judgment of the learned single judge.

it was observed as follows it is therefore obvious that the writ petition invoking jurisdiction of the high court both u arts 226 and 227 of the constitution had tried to make out a case for the high court s interference seeking issuance of an appropriate writ of certiorari u art 226 of the constitution of india.
basic averments for invoking such a jurisdiction were already pleaded in the writ petition for the high court s consideration.
it is true as submitted by learned counsel for the appellant that the order of the learned single judge nowhere stated that the court was considering the writ petition u art 226 of the constitution of india.
it is equally true that the learned single judge dismissed the writ petition by observing that the courts below had appreciated the contentions and rejected the complaint.
but the said observation of the learned single judge did not necessarily mean that the learned judge was not inclined to interfere u art 227 of the constitution of india only.
in this connection it is profitable to have a look at the decision of this court in the case of umaji keshao meshram v radhikabai 1986 supp.
in our opinion where the facts justify a party in filing an application either u art 226 or 227 of the constitution and the party chooses to file his application under both these articles in fairness and justice to such party and in order not to deprive him of the valuable right of appeal the court ought to treat the application as being made under article 226and if in deciding the matter in the final order the court gives ancillary directions which may pertain to article 227this ought not to be held to deprive a party of the right of appeal under cl 15 of the letters patent where the substantial part of the order sought to 296be appealed against is u art 226 such was the view taken by the allahabad high court in aidal singh v karan singh air 1957 all 414 1956 indlaw all 107 and by the punjab high court in raj kishan jain v tulsi dass air 1959 punj 291 1958 indlaw pnh 109 and barham dutt v peoples coop.
consequently it could not be said that cl 15 of the letters patent was not attracted for preferring appeal against the judgment of the learned single judge.

as has been held in the case of surya devi rai supra a writ of certiorari can be issued u art 226 of the constitution against an order of a tribunal or an order passed by the sub ordinate court.
in quintessentiality it can not be put in a state jacket formula that any order of the learned judge that deals with an order arising from an inferior tribunal or the sub ordinate court is an order u art 227 of the constitution of india and not an order u art 226 of the constitution.
in exercise of supervisory jurisdiction the high court may not only quash or set aside the impugned proceedings judgment or order but it may also make such directions as the facts and circumstances of the case may warrant maybe by way of guiding the inferior court or tribunal as to the manner in which it would now proceed further or afresh as commended to or guided by the high court.
in addition a bare reading of this court s earlier order shows that the impugned order is clearly erroneous.
