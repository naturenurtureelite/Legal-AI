as a general rule the substantive evidence of a witness is a statement made in court.
the evidence of mere identification of the accused person at the trial for the first time is from its very nature inherently of a weak character.
the evidence in order to carry conviction should ordinarily clarify as to how and under what circumstances he came to pick out the particular accused person and the details of the part which the accused played in the crime in question with reasonable particularity.
the identification parades belong to the investigation stage.
keeping in view the purpose of identification parades the magistrates holding them are expected to take all possible precautions to eliminate any suspicion of unfairness and to reduce the chance of testimonial error.
they must therefore take intelligent interest in the proceedings bearing in mind two considerations i that the life and liberty of an accused may depend on their vigilance and caution and ii that justice should be done in the identification.
generally speaking the magistrate must make a note of every objection raised by an accused at the time of identification and the steps taken by them to ensure fairness to the accused so that the court which is to judge the value of the identification evidence may take them into consideration in the appreciation of that evidence.
the identification to be of value should also be held without much delay.
the evidence as to identification deserves therefore to be subjected to a close and careful scrutiny by the court.
