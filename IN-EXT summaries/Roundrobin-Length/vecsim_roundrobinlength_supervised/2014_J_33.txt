the collector has no power to adjudicate the dues under the u p zamindari abolition and land revenue act and is merely a recovery agent to recover sums payable as arrears of land revenue upon receipt of a valid recovery certificate.
it was in arrears to the extent of rs 1 29 crores.

any liability incurred by the company or loan etc taken by the receiver is not payable by the company.
it is always open to the competent authority to seek recovery of the amount if due from the company or to adjust the dues.
for the reason aforesaid the impugned order dated 1st march2011 passed by the high court in w p no 10220 of 1996 etc cannot be upheld.
