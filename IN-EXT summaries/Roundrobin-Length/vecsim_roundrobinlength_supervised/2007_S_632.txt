no records there for were available with the state.
in any event having regard to the fact that the said authority himself had denied to have issued a letter there was no reason for the state not to act pursuant thereto or in furtherance thereof.
it was thus for them to establish existence of a legal right in their favour and a corresponding legal duty in the respondents to continue to be employed.
it has also not been shown that the vacancies had been notified to the employment exchange.
he was only a cadre controlling authority.
he was merely put a chairman of the dpc for non ministerial post of the revenue department.
even assuming that dpc would mean selection committee there is noting on record to show who were its members and how and at whose instance it was constituted.
even the affidavit affirmed by shri tayeng before the high court in this behalf is silent.
he therefore was wholly incompetent to issue the appointment letters.
in a case of this nature where the facts are admitted the principles of natural justice were not required to be complied with particularly when the same would result in futility.
in kumari shrilekha vidyarthi 1990 indlaw sc 463 suprathis court was dealing with a question in regard to continuance of the law officers.
it is for this reason that we base our decision on the ground that independent of any statutory right available to the appointees and assuming for the purpose of this case that the rights flow only from the contract of appointment the impugned circular issued in exercise of the executive power of the state must satisfy art 14 of the constitution and if it is shown to be arbitrary it must be struck down.
35 it is now too well settled that every state action in order to survive must not be susceptible to the vice of arbitrariness which is the crux of art 14 of the constitution and basic to the rule of law the system which governs us.
satisfaction of this basic test in every state action is sine qua non to its validity and in this respect the state can not claim comparison with a private individual even in the field of contract.
for the said purpose the district magistrate and the district judge are required to maintain a character roll and a record of the work done by the officer and the capacity displayed by him in discharge of the work.
his work is also subject to strict supervision.
having been selected on merit and for no other consideration they are entitled to continue in their office for the period of the contract of their engagement and they can be removed only for valid reasons.
it is in these circumstances that this court held that the wholesale termination of their services was arbitrary and violative of art 14 of the constitution.
