he lived in the house of shashi didi.
about the assault he deposed that devendra caught bhavna and chandra prakash attacked her with knife 3 to 4 times and she fell down.
after the assault chandra prakash went to the tv room where shashi didi had kept some money in a rubber band on the table.
devendra choubey accused no 4 by paying them money.
it is obvious that accused nos 2 and 4 did not enter the house to commit a robbery and had a single mission namely to kill bhavana.
the learned counsel submitted that the evidence of a child witness must be carefully scrutinized before acceptance since a child can be easy prey for tutoring and the court must insist on corroboration from other evidence.
there was no reason for the sole eye witness anil pw 21 to implicate anybody falsely.
it is not possible for us to accept this contention.
the accused devendra kumar was arrested on 22 12 2003 and his identification parade was conducted on 26 12 2003 within four days there is no evidence on record to show that the child witness had an opportunity to see and study the features of the accused between their arrest and test identification parade to enable a tutored identification.
the evidence of mere identification of the accused person at the trial for the first time is from its very nature inherently of a weak character.
the identification parades belong to the investigation stage.
identification proceedings in their legal effect amount simply to this that certain persons are brought to jail or some other place and make statements either express or implied that certain individuals whom they point out are persons whom they recognise as having been concerned in the crime.
they must therefore take intelligent interest in the proceedings bearing in mind two considerations i that the life and liberty of an accused may depend on their vigilance and caution and ii that justice should be done in the identification.
the persons required to identify an accused should have had no opportunity of seeing him after the commission of the crime and before identification and secondly that no mistakes are made by them or the mistakes made are negligible.
the identification to be of value should also be held without much delay.
in his deposition he specified the details of the part which the accused played with reasonable particularity.

there is no evidence of his having played any part in the crime.
there is no reference to a third person in the fir no evidence that he came with the other accused or left with them.
we therefore hold that the accused mahesh accused no 3 in criminal appeal no 867 of 2013 is innocent and the conviction against him is set aside.
appeals disposed of.
