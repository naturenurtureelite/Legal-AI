the sole eyewitness was a boy of 13 years of age anil kumar pw 21who worked as a servant with the family.
it is anil kumar pw 21who first informed the head of the family dr sharda prasad tripathi pw 1the complainant about the incident when he came home after closing his clinic.
she resided with shashi didi.
about the assault he deposed that devendra caught bhavna and chandra prakash attacked her with knife 3 to 4 times and she fell down.
mahesh the fourth accused was standing outside the house.
after the assault chandra prakash went to the tv room where shashi didi had kept some money in a rubber band on the table.
the accused chandra prakash had threatened him not to disclose anything about the incident to anyone.
this deposition clearly implicates accused nos 12 and 4 the picture that emerges is that shashi tripathi caused bhavna to be killed and for this purpose engaged chandra prakash accused no 2 and raju.
devendra choubey accused no 4 by paying them money.
it is obvious that accused nos 2 and 4 did not enter the house to commit a robbery and had a single mission namely to kill bhavana.
there is no evidence that they had any previous animosity with the deceased and appeared to have acted as contract killers.
the credibility of the evidence of anil kumar pw 21 was attacked by the learned counsel for the appellants who submitted that the boy is a tutored witness who has been influenced by the police with whom he spent a lot of time.
his presence in the house is entirely natural and we have no reason to discard his testimony.
the accused devendra kumar was arrested on 22 12 2003 and his identification parade was conducted on 26 12 2003 within four days there is no evidence on record to show that the child witness had an opportunity to see and study the features of the accused between their arrest and test identification parade to enable a tutored identification.
in any case the period between the arrest and the identification parade was not large enough to constitute inordinate delay.
state of u p 1970 2 scc 128 1970 indlaw sc 136 where this court made the following observations 7 now facts which establish the identity of an accused person are relevant u s 9 of the indian evidence act.
as a general rule the substantive evidence of a witness is a statement made in court.
those proceeding should not make it impossible for the identifiers who after all have as a rule only fleeting glimpses of the person they are supposed to identify.
the identification to be of value should also be held without much delay.
in the present case the child witness has been found to be reliable.
he had no axe to grind against any of the accused.
the learned counsel for mahesh accused no 3 relied on several decisions of this court in suresh sakharam nangare vs.
9 scc 696 2012 indlaw sc 343.
there is no evidence of his having played any part in the crime.
there is no reference to a third person in the fir no evidence that he came with the other accused or left with them.
we therefore hold that the accused mahesh accused no 3 in criminal appeal no 867 of 2013 is innocent and the conviction against him is set aside.
in view of the above criminal appeal no 867 of 2013 is allowed and criminal appeal nos 822 of 2012589 of 2014 and criminal appeal arising out of slp criminal no 3737 of 2014 are dismissed.
appeals disposed of.
