he lived in the house of shashi didi.
he ate his food there and studied in a school.
about the assault he deposed that devendra caught bhavna and chandra prakash attacked her with knife 3 to 4 times and she fell down.
after the assault chandra prakash went to the tv room where shashi didi had kept some money in a rubber band on the table.
thereafter all the three accused fled from there.
shashi didi thereafter started shouting.
this deposition clearly implicates accused nos 12 and 4 the picture that emerges is that shashi tripathi caused bhavna to be killed and for this purpose engaged chandra prakash accused no 2 and raju.
the learned counsel submitted that the evidence of a child witness must be carefully scrutinized before acceptance since a child can be easy prey for tutoring and the court must insist on corroboration from other evidence.
merely because he has been some time in the company of the police at the police station his testimony can not be discarded as untrue.
the learned counsel for the appellants forcefully attacked the conviction of the other accused viz mahesh chandra prakash and devendra kumar who admittedly were not known to the child witness anil kumar.
in any case the period between the arrest and the identification parade was not large enough to constitute inordinate delay.
they are generally held during the course of investigation with the primary object of enabling the witnesses to identify persons concerned in the offence who were not previously known to them.
they do not constitute substantive evidence.
it is for this reason that the identification parades in this case seem to have been held under the supervision of a magistrate.
the observations of this court undoubtedly lay down the correct law and we have no reason to doubt them.
in his deposition he specified the details of the part which the accused played with reasonable particularity.
