accordingly the district collector meerut appointed a receiver under section 286 a of u p zamindari abolition and land reforms acthereinafter referred to as the zamindari abolition act.
subsequently the company was acquired by the state on 28th october1984.
as per provisions of the u p state sugar undertakings acquisition act1971 hereinafter referred to as the acquisition act1971as amended in the year 1984free from all encumbrances and the said unit was vested with the u p state sugar corporation hereinafter referred to as the corporation.
since the company was in arrears to the extent of rs 1 29 crores the district collector meerut by order dated 28th november1984attached all the remaining five constituent units except the sugar mill.
the general manger of the aforesaid sugar unit was appointed as a receiver with reference to all the aforesaid remaining five units.
in between 1977 to 1984for smooth functioning of the sugar mill payment of dues to sugarcane grower repairing of machinery etc.
the district collector meerut taking into consideration the dues to the extent of rs 1 62 crores as on 24th october1990 were to be paid by the company extended the tenure of the receiver till further orders.
pursuant to uttar pradesh imposition of ceiling of land holdings act hereinafter referred to as the ceiling actland admeasuring 723 3 bigha belonging to the company was declared surplus.
as the order dated 18th december1995passed by the district collector meerut is silent about the amount payable to the company the ex proprietor of the company moved an application before the chairman board of revenue and requested to refund the compensation amount to the company.
a separate counter affidavit was filed by the deputy secretary sugar and cane development lucknow giving details of dues payable by the company as detailed by the district collector meerut by his order dated 18th december1995.
against the interim order the appellant state filed the special appeals.
with direction to the appellant to pay the compensation amount to the company.
the grievance of the appellant state is that the high court while passing the impugned order has not noticed the liability incurred by the undertaking and the loan paid to the company.
till date there has not been a single determination adjudication by any court authority of any dues against the company nor is there any claim pending before any authority or before any court on date.
the collector has no power to adjudicate the dues under the u p zamindari abolition and land revenue act and is merely a recovery agent to recover sums payable as arrears of land revenue upon receipt of a valid recovery certificate.
it is not in dispute that the company was under heavy arrears as on 3rd january1977 therefore the district collector meerut appointed the receiver.
the high court by the impugned judgment dated 1st march2011though noticed the aforesaid facts including the fact that the collector tulsi gaur by order dated 20th february1992 held that there were dues of about rs 10 44 crores payable by the company part of which can be adjusted from the compensation amount paid by the meerut development authority even thereafter an amount of rs 6 09 crores will remain payable by the company but the high court failed to address such issue.
the collector tulsi gaur was not a party by name.
on the other hand if any amount is found payable by the company the competent authority may recover the amount in accordance with law.
for determination of the issue involved in c a nos 7122 of 20037123 7124 of 20037125 of 2003 and 7126 7129 of 2003 relevant factual matrix of the case is as follows.
the land of the company measuring 1 391 hectares in village maliyana was put to auction.
the company being aggrieved preferred a civil misc.
it is ordered accordingly.

in a situation like in the present case one can not hold of any statute entitling the auction purchasers to claim interest in case the auction got cancelled or set aside by the court of law.
the question arises as to whether in such a situation an auction purchaser can claim interest on equitable ground.
in state of maharashtra and others vs maimuma banu and others2003 7 scc 448 2003 indlaw sc 625the question arose as to whether interest was payable on rental compensation.
though the inevitable conclusion is that the high court is not justified in directing grant of interest on the logic of various provisions contained in the act yet there is an element of equity in favour of the landowners.
taking into consideration the aforesaid factor while working out equities it would therefore be appropriate to direct the state to pay interest at the rate of 6 on the amount to be refunded as per the high court s order with effect from 27th april2001 and 3rd.
