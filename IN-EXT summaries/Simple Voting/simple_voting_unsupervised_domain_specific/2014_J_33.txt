we have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the records.
it is not in dispute that the company was under heavy arrears as on 3rd january1977 therefore the district collector meerut appointed the receiver.

jaswant sugar mills ltd have been preferred by the commissioner meerut division meerut.
in view of the fact that this court vide order dated 27th.
april2003 in c a nos 7123 7124 of 2003 held that this court is satisfied that no fault can be found with the impugned judgment of the high court so far as the setting aside of the sale is concerned we dismiss the appeals so far it relates to cancellation of auction sale.
we have heard the parties only on the limited question as to why the amount which has been directed to be refunded to the auction purchasers appellants herein should not bear reasonable interest.
the question arises as to whether in such a situation an auction purchaser can claim interest on equitable ground.
in state of maharashtra and others vs maimuma banu and others2003 7 scc 448 2003 indlaw sc 625the question arose as to whether interest was payable on rental compensation.
though the inevitable conclusion is that the high court is not justified in directing grant of interest on the logic of various provisions contained in the act yet there is an element of equity in favour of the landowners.
this factor can not be lost sight of while working out the equities.
6 from 1 4 2000 till amounts payable as rental compensation are paid to the landowners concerned.
this direction shall not apply to those cases where the payments have already been made prior to 1 4 2000 appeals are allowed to the extent indicated without any stipulation of costs.
