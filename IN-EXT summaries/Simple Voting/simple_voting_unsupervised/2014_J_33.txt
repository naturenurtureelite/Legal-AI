the grievance of the appellant state is that the high court while passing the impugned order has not noticed the liability incurred by the undertaking and the loan paid to the company.
according to the appellant the aforesaid issue has not been decided.
on the other hand learned counsel for the respondents made the following submissions i no amount whatsoever is due and payable by the company to the state.
till date there has not been a single determination adjudication by any court authority of any dues against the company nor is there any claim pending before any authority or before any court on date.
the collector has no power to adjudicate the dues under the u p zamindari abolition and land revenue act and is merely a recovery agent to recover sums payable as arrears of land revenue upon receipt of a valid recovery certificate.
we have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the records.
it is not in dispute that the company was under heavy arrears as on 3rd january1977 therefore the district collector meerut appointed the receiver.

the order dated 20th february1992 passed by the collector was also not under challenge inspite of the same the high court declared the order dated 20th february1992 as illegal.
for the reason aforesaid the impugned order dated 1st march2011 passed by the high court in w p no 10220 of 1996 etc cannot be upheld.
the matter is remitted to the district collector meerut to determine the liability of the company upto the date of vesting i e 28th october1984 after notice to the parties.
after determination of liabilities and adjustment of the dues which is payable by the company if any amount is found payable to the company the appellant shall pay the amount within four months from the date of determination.
