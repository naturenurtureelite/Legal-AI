rc 20a97 vsp after recording the statements of the witnesses inspector of police cbi visakhapatnam filed charge sheet being no 298 ytr dated 29 04 1998 against the appellant accused for an offence punishable under sections 7131dii read with s 132 of the prevention of corruption act1988 hereinafter referred to as the act in the court of special judge for cbi cases at visakhapatnam.
the special judge cbi by order dated 19 03 2001convicted the appellant and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of six months and to pay a fine of rs 500 and in default to suffer simple imprisonment for one month for the offence punishable u s 7 of the act and one year rigorous imprisonment with a fine of rs 500 and in default to suffer simple imprisonment for one month for the offence punishable u ss 131d ii.
g against the said order the appellant accused filed criminal appeal no 436 of 2001 before the high court of andhra pradesh.
the high court by impugned judgment dated 03 10 2007 dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant accused and confirmed the conviction passed by the trial court.
heard mr atm rangaramanujam learned senior counsel for the appellant and mr harish chandra learned senior counsel for the respondent.
notice only on quantum of sentence hearing on all aspects.
permissibility.
as stated in the narration of facts the appellant was convicted u s 7 of the act for which he was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months and to pay a fine of rs 500 in default simple imprisonment for one month.
however mr rangaramanujam learned senior counsel for the appellant by drawing our attention to the recent judgment of this court in yomeshbhai pranshankar bhatt vs state of gujarat2011 6 scc 312 2011 indlaw sc 370submitted that in spite of limited notice this court while exercising jurisdiction u art 142 of the constitution in order to do complete justice while hearing the matter finally can go into the merits of the orders passed by the trial court and the high court.
in the reported case the appeal was against the concurrent finding of both the courts convicting the appellant u s 302 ipc and sentencing him to suffer imprisonment for life.
at the slp stage this court by order dated 27 07 2009issued notice confined only to the question as to whether the petitioner was guilty of commission of an offence under any of the parts of s 304 indian penal code1860 in short ipc and not u s 302 ipc similar request was made before the bench that the appellant was entitled to urge all the questions including his right to urge that he should have been acquitted in the facts and circumstances of the case.
rule 6 of the code of civil procedure1908.
after permitting the appellant therein to argue the case for acquittal on merits it observed we however make it clear that this can not be a universal practice in all cases.
emphasis supplied.
in the case on hand it is to be noted that on appreciation of oral and documentary evidence led in by the prosecution and the defence and on appreciation of entire materials the court of first instance i e the trial court convicted the appellant and sentenced him as mentioned above.
the high court as an appellate court once again analysed all the material discussed the oral and documentary evidence and finding that the prosecution had proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt concurred with the conclusion arrived at by the trial court and dismissed the appeal of the appellant.
it is not in dispute that the provisions of the prevention of corruption act1988 alone are applicable since the incident occurred on 14 11 1997 i e subsequent to the act.
s 7 of the act relates to public servant taking gratification other than legal remuneration in respect of an official act.
explanation.
it is useful to refer that in the prevention of corruption act1947 the same criminal misconduct which is available in s 13 of the 1988 act had been dealt with in s 5 of the 1947 act.
in order to substantiate the claim with the regard to the above learned senior counsel for the appellant has relied on the decision of this court in bechaarbhai s prajapati vs state of gujarat2008 11 scc 163 2008 indlaw sc 297 and based on the same requested this court to modify the sentence to the extent of period already undergone.
finally the special judge framed charges for offence punishable under sections 712131d read with s 132 of the act.
the appellant therein was convicted for offence u s 72 of the act and appeal before the high court was also dismissed.
after a gap of 14 years there is no need to retain the same sentence and the court is not justified in directing the appellant to serve the remaining period after such a long time.
there is no dispute as regards the date of occurrence and the date of conviction passed by the trial court and affirmed by the high court.
inasmuch as the conviction on both counts have been confirmed by this court and we are confined to sentence part alone and in view of the minimum sentence prescribed u ss 7 and 13 of the act we are of the view that though long delay may be a ground for reduction of sentence in other cases the same may not be applicable to the case on hand when the statute prescribes minimum sentence.
indlaw sc 716 wherein it was held that it is difficult to accept the prayer of the respondent that a lenient view be taken in this case.
the corruption by public servants has become a gigantic problem.
it has deep and pervasive impact on the functioning of the entire country.
large scale corruption retards the nation building activities and everyone has to suffer on that count.
as has been aptly observed in swatantar singh v state of haryana1997 4 scc 14 1997 indlaw sc 1061corruption is corroding like cancerous lymph nodes the vital veins of the body politics social fabric of efficiency in the public service and demoralising the honest officers.
the reputation of corrupt would gather thick and unchaseable clouds around the conduct of the officer and gain notoriety much faster than the smoke.
similar claim based on art 142 has been negatived in several decisions by this court we need to refer only the latest decision of this court in manish goel vs rohini goel2010 4 scc 393 2010 indlaw sc 301 the facts in that case are that the parties by persuasion of the family members and friends entered into a compromise and prepared a memorandum of understanding dated 13 11 2009in the proceedings pending before the mediation centre delhi by which they agreed on terms and conditions incorporated therein to settle all their disputes and also for dissolution of their marriage.
decree of divorce has been granted to put quietus to all litigations between the parties and to save them from further agony as it is evident from the judgments in romesh chander v savitri.

in anjana kishore v puneet kishore 2002 10 scc 194 2001 indlaw sc 21204this court while allowing a transfer petition directed the court concerned to decide the case of divorce by mutual consent ignoring the statutory requirement of moving the motion after expiry of the period of six months under section 13 b2 of the act.
however we have also noticed various judgments of this court taking a contrary view to the effect that in case the legal ground for grant of divorce is missing exercising such power tantamounts to legislation and thus transgression of the powers of the legislature which is not permissible in law vide chetan dass v kamla devi 2001 4 scc 250 2001 indlaw sc 20206 and vishnu dutt sharma.
generally no court has competence to issue a direction contrary to law nor can the court direct an authority to act in contravention of the statutory provisions.
the courts are meant to enforce the rule of law and not to pass the orders or directions which are contrary to what has been injected by law vide state of punjab v renuka singla 1996 8 scc 90 1996 indlaw sc 2663state of u p v.
