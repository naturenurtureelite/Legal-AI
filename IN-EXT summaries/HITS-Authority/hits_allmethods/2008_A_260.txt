for the sake of convenience we refer to the facts mentioned in civil appeal no of 2008 arising out of s l p c no 15729 of 2008 filed by j mitra co pvt ltd.
this matter is a classic illustration of the confusion which has emerged on account of the postponement of in part commencement of patents amendment act2005.
quite often the commencement of an act is postponed to some specified future date or to such date as the appropriate government may by notification in the official gazette appoint.
provision is also at times made for appointment of different dates for coming into force of different parts of the same act.
this is what has exactly happened in this case resulting into utter confusion with regard to pending fao no 29306 filed by respondent no 3 in the high court u s 116 of the indian patents.

this section was not brought into force till 2 4 2007.
in short by the patents amendment act2005for the first time a dichotomy was introduced in the patent law between opposition to the pre grant and opposition to the post grant of patent.
this was the major structural change in the patent law.
similarly under the patents amendment act2005appeal was restricted to the post grant opposition orders and that appeal lay before the appellate board and not to the high court.
here also s 25 of the patents act1970 as amended by patents amendment act2005.
act2005a dichotomy was brought in between pre grant and post grant opposition orders.
the legislature intended to provide for only one statutory appeal to the appellate board but by not bringing s 61 into force till 2 4 07appeals filed during the interregnum as in this case became vulnerable and liable to be dismissed as misconceived as is contended by the appellant.
on 19 10 2006 when fao no 29306 was filed in the high court chapter xix of the parent act as amended vide patents amendment.
act1999 continued to be in operation notwithstanding the enactment of the patents.
amendment act2002 and the patents amendment.
that amended s 117 g is consequential to the enforcement of the jurisdiction of the appellate board u s 64 which results to revocation of patent.
according to the appellant with the change in s 25 brought about by patents amendment act2005a dichotomy was introduced in the patents act1970 according to the appellant that dichotomy was between pre grant opposition and post grant opposition.
according to the appellant this was a structural change in the principal act.
at times provision is made for appointment of different dates for coming into force of different parts of the same act.
by reason of patents amendment act2005the kind of opposition available under the said 1970 act is different from what existed earlier.
therefore the courts had evolved the rule of caution as the patent had not faced any challenge at the hands of interested parties.
there is however a radical shift due to incorporation of s 252 where an interested party is granted the right to challenge the patent after its grant.
the ground of challenge under s 251 is identical to s 252 of the said 1970 act.
the main difference between s 251 and s 252as brought about by patents amendment.
act2005is that even after a patent is grantedpost grant opposition can be filed under s 25 2 for a period of one year.
this is the main rationale underlying s 252 of the said 1970 act.
therefore the legislature intended an appeal under section 117a2 to the appellate board from any decision order or direction of the controller inter alia under s 254 which refers to the power of the controller to maintain amend or revoke the patent.
in the present case the legislature intended to provide for two types of scrutiny followed by one statutory appeal to the appellate board against post grant proceedings.
the legislature intended to have a dichotomy between pre grant opposition and post grant opposition.
however the legislature intended that there shall be only one statutory appeal against grant of patent.
the legislature intended to obliterate appeal from pre grant proceedingswhich existed earlier.
however it was left to the executive to bring the enacted law into force vide notification.
it is during this interregnum that respondent no 3 filed its fao no 29306 in the high court under section 116as.
it stood on 19 10 06 under the patents amendment act1999 on that date the amended section 117a suggested by patents amendment act2005was not brought into force.
on 19 10 06 the old law prevailed under which an appeal lay before the high court.
no 29306 we have to decide the fate of these pending appeals.
no 29206 and fao.
no 29306would remain in the high court.
no 3 can not be let without remedy.
the appellate board after 2 4 07 is entitled to hear appeals only arising from orders passed by the controller under s 254i e.
therefore there is no point in transferring the pending fao no 29206 and fao no 29306 to the appellate board which has no authority to decide matters concerning pre grant opposition.
amendment act1999 against orders passed by the controller in pre grant opposition proceedings.
