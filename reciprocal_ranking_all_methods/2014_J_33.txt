pootha farm.
northern india paper mills.
bindal vanaspati ghee mills.
meduwala open pan sugar bijnor.
the company was in heavy arrears as on 3rd january1977 to the extent of rs 1 14 crores.
accordingly the district collector meerut appointed a receiver under section 286 a of u p zamindari abolition and land reforms acthereinafter referred to as the zamindari abolition act.
subsequently the company was acquired by the state on 28th october1984.
as per provisions of the u p state sugar undertakings acquisition act1971 hereinafter referred to as the acquisition act1971as amended in the year 1984free from all encumbrances and the said unit was vested with the u p state sugar corporation hereinafter referred to as the corporation.
since the company was in arrears to the extent of rs 1 29 crores the district collector meerut by order dated 28th november1984attached all the remaining five constituent units except the sugar mill.
the general manger of the aforesaid sugar unit was appointed as a receiver with reference to all the aforesaid remaining five units.
on the request of the receiver the state government granted loan of rs 6 13 crores to the company and was to be recovered as the arrears of land revenue along with interest.
the district collector meerut taking into consideration the dues to the extent of rs 1 62 crores as on 24th october1990 were to be paid by the company extended the tenure of the receiver till further orders.
the order of the extension of tenure of the receiver was challenged by the ex proprietors of the company in a writ petition no 184961991 subsequently the receiver was withdrawn on 18th december1995therefore the writ petition was also withdrawn.
pursuant to uttar pradesh imposition of ceiling of land holdings act hereinafter referred to as the ceiling actland admeasuring 723 3 bigha belonging to the company was declared surplus.
against the same a writ petition no 39051987 was preferred by the company.
during the pendency of the aforesaid writ petition the state government issued a notification dated 14th august1987 u s 4 read with s 174 of the land acquisition act1894 for the meerut development authority.
it was followed by a notification dated 4th september1987 issued u s 6 of the acquisition act.
the said notification included the land of m s pootha farm a constituent unit of the company.
in the said case compensation amount of rs 4 33 crores was awarded by special land acquisition officer vide award dated 22nd february1990.
the district collector meerut pursuant to a report of the tehsildar ordered to pay the compensation amount after adjustment of different dues payable by the company 11 pursuant to a court s order the district collector meerut passed a speaking order dated 20th february1992 showing the details of adjustments to be made out of compensation amount of rs 4 34 crores payable by the company as detailed below.
the district collector in the said order dated 20th february1992 concluded that after such adjustment the following dues were still to be paid by the company.
the state government filed the deduction statement for recovery of the dues before the prescribed authority constituted under u p sugar undertaking acquisition act1971 however the aforesaid claim was rejected by the prescribed authority by order dated 4th october1994 in claim no 13 of 1999.
against the said order dated 4th october1994 passed by the prescribed authority the appellant filed appeal no 195 before the appellate tribunal.
the company moved an application before the district collector meerut stating therein that as on date there are no arrears liability payable by the company therefore requested to remove the receiver.
as the order dated 18th december1995passed by the district collector meerut is silent about the amount payable to the company the ex proprietor of the company moved an application before the chairman board of revenue and requested to refund the compensation amount to the company.
during the pendency of the said case the chairman board of revenue by order dated 3rd august1996 directed that out of the total amount of rs 4 33 crores received as compensation from meerut development authority after deduction of a sum of rs 1 62 crores along with interest and collection charges the balance amount shall be refunded to the company.
the high court by judgment and order dated 23rd february2011 quashed the notice dated 22nd august2005.
subsequently impugned common judgment and order dated 1st.
the grievance of the appellant state is that the high court while passing the impugned order has not noticed the liability incurred by the undertaking and the loan paid to the company.
according to the appellant the aforesaid issue has not been decided.
till date there has not been a single determination adjudication by any court authority of any dues against the company nor is there any claim pending before any authority or before any court on date.
the collector has no power to adjudicate the dues under the u p zamindari abolition and land revenue act and is merely a recovery agent to recover sums payable as arrears of land revenue upon receipt of a valid recovery certificate.
we have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the records.
it is not in dispute that the company was under heavy arrears as on 3rd january1977 therefore the district collector meerut appointed the receiver.
subsequently sugar mill of the company was acquired on 28th october1984.
it was in arrears to the extent of rs 1 29 crores.
therefore the district collector meerut attached remaining five constituent units and the general manager of the sugar unit was appointed as a receiver.
