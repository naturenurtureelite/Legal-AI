in short by the patents amendment act2005for the first time a dichotomy was introduced in the patent law between opposition to the pre grant and opposition to the post grant of patent.
similarly under the patents amendment act2005appeal was restricted to the post grant opposition orders and that appeal lay before the appellate board and not to the high court.
here also s 25 of the patents act1970 as amended by patents amendment act2005.
as stated vide patents amendment.
act2005a dichotomy was brought in between pre grant and post grant opposition orders.
act1999 continued to be in operation notwithstanding the enactment of the patents.
amendment act2002 and the patents amendment.
act2005 as the amended ss 116 and 117a were brought into force only vide notification dated 2 4 07 one more point needs to be noted.
according to the appellant with the change in s 25 brought about by patents amendment act2005a dichotomy was introduced in the patents act1970 according to the appellant that dichotomy was between pre grant opposition and post grant opposition.
according to the appellant this was a structural change in the principal act.
according to the appellant on 23 8 06 the controller rejected its pre grant opposition and on that day post grant opposition avenue was open to respondent no 3 vide s 252 according to the appellant under the amended s 25 on rejection of pre grant opposition it was open to respondent.
and lastly it was argued on behalf respondent no 3 that the appellant had filed its application for grant of patent on 14 6 2000it was notified on 20 11 04however respondent no 3 had filed its pre grant opposition under s 251 on 21 3 05 when the patents amendment act2005 was not promulgated it was promulgated on 4 4 05 and therefore according to respondent no 3 its pre grant opposition filed on 21 3 05 was valid and proper as respondent no 3 could not have invoked s 252 proceedings on that day namely21 3 05 as the law stood enacted bringing in s 252 only on 4 4 05 in the peculiar circumstances of this case it was urged on behalf of respondent no 3 that no interference is called for by this court in this batch of civil appeals.
as stated above quite often the commencement of an act is postponed to some specific future date or to such date as the appropriate government may by notification in the official gazette appoint.
at times provision is made for appointment of different dates for coming into force of different parts of the same act.
an act can not be said to commence or to be in force unless it is brought into operation by legislative enactment or by the exercise of authority by a delegate empowered to bring it into operation.
by reason of patents amendment act2005the kind of opposition available under the said 1970 act is different from what existed earlier.
the ground of challenge under s 251 is identical to s 252 of the said 1970 act.
act2005is that even after a patent is grantedpost grant opposition can be filed under s 25 2 for a period of one year.
in the present case the legislature intended to provide for two types of scrutiny followed by one statutory appeal to the appellate board against post grant proceedings.
the legislature intended to have a dichotomy between pre grant opposition and post grant opposition.
it is during this interregnum that respondent no 3 filed its fao no 29306 in the high court under section 116as.
no 29206 and fao.
no 29306would remain in the high court.
the appellate board after 2 4 07 is entitled to hear appeals only arising from orders passed by the controller under s 254i e.
therefore there is no point in transferring the pending fao no 29206 and fao no 29306 to the appellate board which has no authority to decide matters concerning pre grant opposition.
amendment act1999 against orders passed by the controller in pre grant opposition proceedings.
accordingly the two civil appeals filed by the appellant herein stand disposed of with no order as to costs.
appeal disposed of.
