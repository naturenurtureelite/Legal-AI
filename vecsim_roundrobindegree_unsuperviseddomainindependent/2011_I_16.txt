brief facts a the appellant accused was working as a head clerk in the traffic cadre section in the office of the senior divisional personnel officer south central railway vijayawada during the period from april1992 to november1997 the nature of duties of the appellant accused included dealing with and processing of the matters like promotions transfers seniority list roster list pay fixation on promotions retirements resignations etc of the personnel.
one k rama rao the complainant who was examined as pw 1was posted as yard points man grade a under station superintendent south central railway tanuku from december1995 to june1997 in june1997due to excess staff at tanuku.
later pw 1 was transferred to vijayawada.
as the appellant accused was dealing with the transfers the complainant pw 1 met him on 05 11 1997 at his office to pursue about the issuance of the said transfer order.
again a day after i e on.
13 11 1997when he met the appellant accused he informed him that his request for transfer has been processed and the order is ready and the same has been placed before the a p o for signature and asked him to come on the next day i e on 14 11 1997and demanded rs 200 for releasing the said office order.
on the same daypw 1 reported the matter in writing to the inspector of police central bureau of investigation in short the cbivijayawada.

permissibility.
on 28 01 2008this court consisting of three honourable judges issued notice in this matter confining to the quantum of sentence only.
in pursuance of the same we permitted mr rangaramanujam learned senior counsel for the appellant to address his arguments confining to quantum of sentence imposed on the appellant accused.
he was also convicted for the offence under s 131dii read with s 132 of the act and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year and fine of rs 500 in default simple imprisonment for one month.
if we confine ourselves to the limited extent of notice dated 28 01 2008we have to hear both sides only on the quantum of sentence.
rule 6 of the code of civil procedure1908.
since in the facts of this case we find that the appellant should be heard on all points we have come to the aforesaid conclusion.
emphasis supplied.
it is clear that the bench itself has clarified that they are not laying down the law that in spite of issuing notice confining to a particular aspect in the case on hand quantum of sentence the parties are entitled to urge all points and re open the case as if they are free to do the same without any restriction.
as a matter of fact the last sentence in para 18 makes it clear that in the facts and circumstances of that case they permitted the appellants to urge all points on merits.
in the case on hand it is to be noted that on appreciation of oral and documentary evidence led in by the prosecution and the defence and on appreciation of entire materials the court of first instance i e the trial court convicted the appellant and sentenced him as mentioned above.
quantum of sentence.
mr rangaramanujam learned senior counsel for the appellant submitted that inasmuch as the alleged incident took place on 14 11 1997 and 14 years have elapsed since then the amount of rs 200 said to have been received by the appellant is trivial in nature and also of the fact that due to the said conviction and sentence he lost his job leniency may be shown and sentence be reduced to the period already undergone.
he fairly admitted that out of the maximum period of one year the appellant had served only 52 days in prison.
if the said offence charge is proved the court has no other option but to impose sentence of imprisonment which shall be not less than six months but which may extend to five years and also liable to fine.
s 13 deals with criminal misconduct by a public servant.
as per sub s 2 if any public servant commits criminal misconduct shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall be not less than one year but which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine.
for clarity we reproduce the said section hereunder criminal misconduct by a public servant  1.
explanation.
any public servant who commits criminal misconduct shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall be not less than one year but which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine.
s 52 of the 1947 act mandates that any public servant who commits criminal misconduct shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than one year but which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine.
such relaxation in the form of a proviso has been done away with in the 1988 act.
no other interpretation is permissible.
it is true that even in the cited decision the appellant accused demanded only rs 250 and it was paid and accepted.
finally the special judge framed charges for offence punishable under sections 712131d read with s 132 of the act.
in that case taking note of the fact that the occurrence took place nearly seven years back and also of the fact that the appellant had suffered custody for more than six months considering all these aspects while maintaining the conviction this court reduced the sentence to the period already undergone.
accordingly we reject the said contention.
it was further contended that the amount alleged to have been received by the appellant accused is only rs 200 and he also lost his job after conviction by the trial court.

7 scc 734 2008 indlaw sc 1077 however these are the cases where this court came to rescue the parties on the ground for divorce not provided for by the legislature in the statute.
in anjana kishore v puneet kishore 2002 10 scc 194 2001 indlaw sc 21204this court while allowing a transfer petition directed the court concerned to decide the case of divorce by mutual consent ignoring the statutory requirement of moving the motion after expiry of the period of six months under section 13 b2 of the act.
in anil kumar jain this court held that an order of waiving the statutory requirements can be passed only by this court in exercise of its powers u art 142 of the constitution.
however we have also noticed various judgments of this court taking a contrary view to the effect that in case the legal ground for grant of divorce is missing exercising such power tantamounts to legislation and thus transgression of the powers of the legislature which is not permissible in law vide chetan dass v kamla devi 2001 4 scc 250 2001 indlaw sc 20206 and vishnu dutt sharma.

however it is to be made clear that this power can not be used to supplant the law applicable to the case.
after elaborately discussing almost all the case laws on this subject about jurisdiction of this court under article 142summarised the same in the following words therefore the law in this regard can be summarised to the effect that in exercise of the power u art 142 of the constitution this court generally does not pass an order in contravention of or ignoring the statutory provisions nor is the power exercised merely on sympathy.
in supreme court bar association v union of india 1998 4 scc 409.
it is well recognised and established that this court has always been a law maker and its role travels beyond merely dispute settling.
it is a problem solver in the nebulous areas see.
in kalyan chandra sarkar v rajesh ranjan 2005 3.
powers also exist independent of the statutes with a view to do complete justice between the parties and are in the nature of supplementary powers.
and may be put on a different and perhaps even wider footing than ordinary inherent powers of a court to prevent injustice.
finally learned senior counsel for the appellant has cited certain orders of this court wherein this court has reduced the period of sentence already undergone while upholding the conviction.
we have perused those orders.
an order which this court can make in order to do complete justice between the parties must not only be consistent with the fundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution but also it can not even be inconsistent with the substantive provisions of the relevant statute.
h the power u art 142 of the constitution is a constitutional power and not restricted by statutory enactments.
in other words acting under article 142this court can not pass an order or grant relief which is totally inconsistent or goes against the substantive or statutory enactments pertaining to the case.
i the powers u art 142 are not meant to be exercised when their exercise may come directly in conflict with what has been expressly provided for in statute dealing expressly with the subject.
in the light of the above discussion we are unable to accept any of the contentions raised by the learned senior counsel for the appellant on the other hand we are in entire agreement with the conclusion arrived at by the trial judge as affirmed by the high court.
consequently the appeal fails and the same is dismissed.
