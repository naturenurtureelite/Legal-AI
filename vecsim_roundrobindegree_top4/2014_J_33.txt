in view of the fact that this court vide order dated 27th.
april2003 in c a nos 7123 7124 of 2003 held that this court is satisfied that no fault can be found with the impugned judgment of the high court so far as the setting aside of the sale is concerned we dismiss the appeals so far it relates to cancellation of auction sale.
in a situation like in the present case one can not hold of any statute entitling the auction purchasers to claim interest in case the auction got cancelled or set aside by the court of law.
counsel for the parties also could not refer any of the clauses of auction prescribing interest on refund of amount in case of cancellation of auction or sale.
in the said case government resolution provided for payment of rental compensation expeditiously but no provision was made to pay interest in case of delayed payment.
11 it is not in dispute that in certain cases payments have already been made.
it is however seen that the writ applications were filed long after the possession was taken.
6 from 1 4 2000 till amounts payable as rental compensation are paid to the landowners concerned.
in the present case we find that there was no mis representation on the part of the auction purchasers they deposited the total auction amount within the time stipulated.
it has not been in dispute that the title of the land was also transferred in their favour.
but for the reasons mentioned by the high court the sale has been cancelled.
it has been ordered to refund amount in favour of the auction purchaser appellants we find no reason as to why on equitable grounds the appellants should not get interest on the said amount.
taking into consideration the aforesaid factor while working out equities it would therefore be appropriate to direct the state to pay interest at the rate of 6 on the amount to be refunded as per the high court s order with effect from 27th april2001 and 3rd.
the concerned respondents are directed accordingly.
