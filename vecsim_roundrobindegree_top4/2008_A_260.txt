here also s 25 of the patents act1970 as amended by patents amendment act2005.
act2005 as the amended ss 116 and 117a were brought into force only vide notification dated 2 4 07 one more point needs to be noted.
and lastly it was argued on behalf respondent no 3 that the appellant had filed its application for grant of patent on 14 6 2000it was notified on 20 11 04however respondent no 3 had filed its pre grant opposition under s 251 on 21 3 05 when the patents amendment act2005 was not promulgated it was promulgated on 4 4 05 and therefore according to respondent no 3 its pre grant opposition filed on 21 3 05 was valid and proper as respondent no 3 could not have invoked s 252 proceedings on that day namely21 3 05 as the law stood enacted bringing in s 252 only on 4 4 05 in the peculiar circumstances of this case it was urged on behalf of respondent no 3 that no interference is called for by this court in this batch of civil appeals.
an act can not be said to commence or to be in force unless it is brought into operation by legislative enactment or by the exercise of authority by a delegate empowered to bring it into operation.
by reason of patents amendment act2005the kind of opposition available under the said 1970 act is different from what existed earlier.
in relation to patents that are of recent origin a higher scrutiny is necessary.
however the legislature intended that there shall be only one statutory appeal against grant of patent.
however it was left to the executive to bring the enacted law into force vide notification.
no 3 can not be let without remedy.

amendment act1999 against orders passed by the controller in pre grant opposition proceedings.
accordingly the two civil appeals filed by the appellant herein stand disposed of with no order as to costs.
