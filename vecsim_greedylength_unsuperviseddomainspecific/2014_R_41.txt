the sole eyewitness was a boy of 13 years of age anil kumar pw 21who worked as a servant with the family.
he participated in the identification parade which was held in sub jail bemetara and identified the accused persons in the court by touching them.
he deposed before the court that shashi didi accused brought him to village jevra from bilaspur.
he ate his food there and studied in a school.
his brother shivendra studies at calcutta.
he referred to bhavna as bhabhi.
about the assault he deposed that devendra caught bhavna and chandra prakash attacked her with knife 3 to 4 times and she fell down.
the incident occurred in the courtyard and shashi didi was present in the passage.
after the assault chandra prakash went to the tv room where shashi didi had kept some money in a rubber band on the table.
devendra choubey accused no 4 by paying them money.
he was brought to the house by shashi tripathi accusedwho apparently took care of him and sent to school and gave him food and residence.
this serves to satisfy the investigating officers of the bona fides of the prosecution witnesses and also to furnish evidence to corroborate their testimony in court.
it is for this reason that the identification parades in this case seem to have been held under the supervision of a magistrate.
generally speaking the magistrate must make a note of every objection raised by an accused at the time of identification and the steps taken by them to ensure fairness to the accused so that the court which is to judge the value of the identification evidence may take them into consideration in the appreciation of that evidence.
the observations of this court undoubtedly lay down the correct law and we have no reason to doubt them.
in such a situation it is considered a safe rule of prudence to generally look for corroboration of the sworn testimony of witness in court as to the identity of the accused who are strangers to them in the form of earlier identification proceeding as observed by this court in budhsen s case 1970 indlaw sc 136 supra.
sc 367 1982 indlaw sc 63 the facts and circumstances of the cases are however different and it is not necessary to consider those cases in detail while dealing with the present case.
9 scc 696 2012 indlaw sc 343.
mahesh did not even act as a guard he did not prevent anil kumar pw 21 from entering the house.
we therefore hold that the accused mahesh accused no 3 in criminal appeal no 867 of 2013 is innocent and the conviction against him is set aside.
appeals disposed of.
