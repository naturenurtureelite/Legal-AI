the company preferred two writ petitions challenging the orders passed by the district magistrate collector meerut and board of revenue dated 18th december1995 and 3rd august1996 respectively.
the writ petitions were disposed of by the learned single judge of allahabad high court by a common judgment dated 1st.
february1992 the impugned judgment dated 1st march2011 has been challenged by the state of u p in c a nos 6169 6171 of 2013 state of u p ors.
a piece of land of the company was put to auction for recovery of dues of the company.
in a review application preferred by auction purchaser the high court by order dated 3rd september2001 directed the respondents to refund the amount to the auction purchasers.
for determination of the issue involved in c a nos 6169 6171 of 2013 and c a nos 6172 6174 of 2013it is desirable to refer the relevant factual matrix of the case which is as follows.
accordingly the district collector meerut appointed a receiver under section 286 a of u p zamindari abolition and land reforms acthereinafter referred to as the zamindari abolition act.
during the pendency of the aforesaid writ petition the state government issued a notification dated 14th august1987 u s 4 read with s 174 of the land acquisition act1894 for the meerut development authority.
the district collector in the said order dated 20th february1992 concluded that after such adjustment the following dues were still to be paid by the company.
the state government filed the deduction statement for recovery of the dues before the prescribed authority constituted under u p sugar undertaking acquisition act1971 however the aforesaid claim was rejected by the prescribed authority by order dated 4th october1994 in claim no 13 of 1999.
against the said order dated 4th october1994 passed by the prescribed authority the appellant filed appeal no 195 before the appellate tribunal.
by order dated 12th october1995the appellate tribunal directed the appellant to file a fresh deduction claim before the prescribed authority.
an order was passed to appoint a chartered accountant to complete the audit of the accounts.
the company filed a writ petition no 102201996 before high court for modification of the order of the district collector meerut dated 18th december1995.
during the pendency of the said case the chairman board of revenue by order dated 3rd august1996 directed that out of the total amount of rs 4 33 crores received as compensation from meerut development authority after deduction of a sum of rs 1 62 crores along with interest and collection charges the balance amount shall be refunded to the company.
in the said case the u p state sugar corporation ltd filed a counter affidavit refuting such stand taken by the company.
a separate counter affidavit was filed by the deputy secretary sugar and cane development lucknow giving details of dues payable by the company as detailed by the district collector meerut by his order dated 18th december1995.
payments so made shall be subject to final decision of the writ petition.
subsequently impugned common judgment and order dated 1st.
march2011 was passed in writ petition no 313781996etc.
the grievance of the appellant state is that the high court while passing the impugned order has not noticed the liability incurred by the undertaking and the loan paid to the company.
according to the appellant the aforesaid issue has not been decided.
till date there has not been a single determination adjudication by any court authority of any dues against the company nor is there any claim pending before any authority or before any court on date.
furthermore the state has not been able to produce any recovery certificate of any department showing any dues against the company.
therefore the district collector meerut attached remaining five constituent units and the general manager of the sugar unit was appointed as a receiver.
the high court by the impugned judgment dated 1st march2011though noticed the aforesaid facts including the fact that the collector tulsi gaur by order dated 20th february1992 held that there were dues of about rs 10 44 crores payable by the company part of which can be adjusted from the compensation amount paid by the meerut development authority even thereafter an amount of rs 6 09 crores will remain payable by the company but the high court failed to address such issue.
the high court though noticed that s 8 of the u p state sugar undertakings acquisition act1971 empowers the prescribed authority to decide any dispute regarding the amount payable to any person or authority in respect of earlier liabilities of the undertaking but it wrongly held that in view of the provisions of the u p sugar undertakings acquisition act1971.
any liability incurred by the company or loan etc taken by the receiver is not payable by the company.
the collector tulsi gaur was not a party by name.
the same is accordingly set aside.
the matter is remitted to the district collector meerut to determine the liability of the company upto the date of vesting i e 28th october1984 after notice to the parties.
the authority while so determining shall take into consideration the liability of the company as on 28th october1984including labour charges sales tax loan amount given by the state government etc if payable.
c a no 7122 of 2003c a nos 7123 7124 of 2003 and c a no 7125 of 2003.
ltd and another were the highest bidders.
ltd being aggrieved by the said judgment preferred review application under order xlvii rule 1 cpc for review of the judgment and order dated 27th april2001 passed by the high court.
it is ordered accordingly.
on 30th october2002 c a no 7122 of 2003 preferred by m s ltd was taken up and this court passed the following order delay condoned.
permission to file the special leave petition is granted.
after hearing the learned counsel for the petitioners we are satisfied that no fault can be found with the impugned judgment of the high court so far as the setting aside of the sale is concerned.
the learned counsel for the petitioners invites our attention to the order dated 20 10 2002 page 94c of the paper book issue notice to respondent nos 1 to 4 limited to the question as to why the amount which will be directed to be refunded to the petitioners herein consequent upon the sale having been set aside should not bear reasonable interest.
as against the said order c a nos 7126 292003.
april2003 in c a nos 7123 7124 of 2003 held that this court is satisfied that no fault can be found with the impugned judgment of the high court so far as the setting aside of the sale is concerned we dismiss the appeals so far it relates to cancellation of auction sale.
counsel for the parties also could not refer any of the clauses of auction prescribing interest on refund of amount in case of cancellation of auction or sale.
in state of maharashtra and others vs maimuma banu and others2003 7 scc 448 2003 indlaw sc 625the question arose as to whether interest was payable on rental compensation.
this factor can not be lost sight of while working out the equities.
6 from 1 4 2000 till amounts payable as rental compensation are paid to the landowners concerned.
it has not been in dispute that the title of the land was also transferred in their favour.
it has been ordered to refund amount in favour of the auction purchaser appellants we find no reason as to why on equitable grounds the appellants should not get interest on the said amount.
no costs.
appeals dismissed.
