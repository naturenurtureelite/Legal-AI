after migration the family took shelter at refugee camp of pimpri pune in maharashtra.
accordingly father of the appellant was allotted a land admeasuring 2 acres 5 gunthas bearing revenue survey nos 351 and 1182 situated at village lonavala taluka maval district pune.
it has been pleaded by the appellant that survey no 1181 and 1182 are one and the same thing.
in the said sale certificate the c t s no 129130 a130 b and 133 of village lonavala were mentioned.
on the basis of the said sale certificate the mutation entry no 1836 was effected in the village record in favour of gulabai desai and thereby her name was entered in survey nos 1181b and 328 of village lonavala to the extent of 29 30 ares and 70 ares respectively.
thereafter gulabai sold cts no 133 admeasuring 33 gunthas on 24 4 1977 to respondent no 3 genu kadu.
however in the facts of the conflicting claims the appellant made grievance to the deputy collector and the deputy custodian of evacuee properties in respect of the mutation made in favour of the respondent gulabai and other respondents and therefore by order dated 18 9 1984 the deputy collector and deputy custodian of evacuee properties pune directed the sub divisional officer haveli sub division to take up the case in revision under section 257 of maharashtra land revenue code and pass necessary orders.
in view of these directions the sub divisional officer haveli sub division pune initiated proceeding rts revision 14 of 1984 and by order dated 30 7 1985 cancelled the mutation entry no 1836 which comprises land admeasuring 7897 sq yards and directed necessary corrections in the record as per the observations made in the order.
after remand the sub divisional officer conducted inquiry and again passed an order on 29 10 1987 and confirmed the earlier order.
being aggrieved by the order passed in the said revision respondent no 2 lalwani preferred rts appeal no 81 of 2000 and the respondent no 3 genu kadu preferred rts appeal no 114 of 2000 both.
respondent no 2 challenged this order of the additional commissioner by filing the proceeding rts 3402 pra kra 309 l 6 by way of second revision before the revenue minister for state and the said proceeding was decided by the minister for state on 18 10 2002 the revenue minister allowed the said proceeding and set aside the orders passed by the sub divisional officer maval dated 28 1 2000order dated 28 5 2001 of additional collector pune and of additional commissioner dated 22 11 2001and thus restored the position as reflected by the mutation entries nos 1836 and 2377 and 2394 thus all the entries in favour of the respondents were protected and maintained by the order of the state minister for revenue.
however the sub divisional officer has taken the said mutation in revision in rts revision no 14 of 1984 and has set aside the mutation by order dated 30 7 1985 there was appeal as against that order which was remanded.
as against that the rts proceeding bearing no 3402 pra.
in the alternative learned senior counsel submitted that even if it were to be admitted without prejudice that second revision is maintainable the minister being the revisional authority should not have interfered with the findings recorded by all the six revenue authorities.

learned counsel submitted that section 257 expressly confers power of revision on the state government which power is coupled with power of control and superintendence.
srivastava then contended that the high court correctly analysed and appreciated the scheme of the code vis a vis judicial review in revenue matters.
learned counsel put heavy reliance on the decision of this court in the case of ishwar singh vs.
state of rajasthan and others2005.
2 scc 334 2005 indlaw sc 6 for the proposition that there can be a second revision under the same provision of the statute.
before we proceed to decide the aforesaid question we would like to refer the relevant provisions of the maharashtra land revenue code 1966.
6 revenue officers in division.
7 revenue officers in district 1the state government shall appoint a collector for each district including the city of bombay who shall be in charge of the revenue administration there of and a tahsildar for each taluka who shall be the chief officer entrusted with the local revenue administration of a taluka.
assistants as may be expressed in the order of their appointmentone or more naib tahsildars in a taluka and one or more additional tahsidars or naib tahsildars therein and such other persons having such designations to assist the revenue officers as it may deem expedient.
the collector may appoint to each district as many persons as he thinks fit to be circle officers and circle inspectors to be in charge of a circle and one or more talathis for a saza and one or more kotwals or other village servants for each village or group of villages as he may deem fit.
1 all revenue officers shall be subordinate to the state government.
2 unless the state government directs otherwise all revenue officers in a division shall be subordinate to the commissioner and all revenue officers 2in a district including the city of bombay shall be subordinate to the collector.
sections 13 and 14 deal with the powers and duties of all revenue officers.
section 5 makes it clear that the chief controlling authority in all matters connected with the land revenue in his division shall vest with the commissioner subject to superintendence directions and control of the state government.
section 11 provides that all revenue officers shall be subordinate to the state government.
provided that in no case the number of appeals shall exceed two 2 when on account of promotion of change of designation an appeal against any decision or order lies under this section to the same officer who has passed the decision or order appealed against the appeal shall lie to such other officer competent to decide the appeal to whom it may be transferred under the provisions of this code.
a tahsildar a naib tahsildar and a district inspector of land records.
3 if in any case it shall appear to the state government or any officer referred to in sub section 1 or sub section 2 that any decision or order or proceedings so called for should be modified annulled or reversed it or he may pass such order thereon as it or he deems fit.
provided further that an assistant of deputy collector shall not himself pass such order in any matter in which a formal inquiry has been held but shall submit the record with his opinion to the collector who shall pall such order thereon as he may deem fit.
a bare reading of the aforesaid provision would show that the provision uses the word and for state government but for other revenue officers.
hence even if one party goes to the commissioner in revision the state government can still be approached under section 257 for revision.
further in view of the fact that state government itself appoints the revenue officers including the commissioner under the scheme of the code and all revenue officers are subordinate to the state government as per section 11 of the act and even the chief controlling authority in all matters connected with the land revenue in his division is vested with the commissioner they are subject to the superintendence direction and control of the state government as provided under section 5 of the code.
in other words the state government in exercise of its revisional as well as general power of superintendence and control can call for any record of proceedings and consider the legality and propriety of the orders passed by the revenue officers under section 247 or 257 of the code.
there is nothing in the code to suggest that if these revisional powers are exercised by a revenue officer who has jurisdiction it can not be further exercised by a superior revenue officer or by the state government.
a similar question came for consideration before this court in the case of ishwar singh vs 2 scc 334 under the rajasthan cooperative societies act1965 in that ac t by section 128 power was conferred upon the state government and the registrar to call for and examine the records of any enquiry or proceedings of any other matter of any officer subordinate to them for the purpose of satisfying themselves as to the legality or propriety of any decision or order passed by such officer.
it was submitted by the counsel that section 128 related to two authorities i e the state government and the registrar.
in fact the two authorities are interchangeable.
therefore under chapter xiii a clear distinction is made between the state government and the registrar.
the test is whether the two authorities with concurrent revisional jurisdiction are equal in rank.
considering the entire scheme of the code and the provisions contained in sections 257 and 259we are of the definite opinion that the minister concerned of the state government can entertain second revision to satisfy the legality and propriety of the order passed by the revenue officer.
petition dismissed.
