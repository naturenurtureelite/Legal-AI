781 VS Desai Mrs J Wad and Miss Aruna Mathur for the Appellants.
Now proceed to record our reasons.
Sessions Case 26 of 1977 is stated to be an off shoot of what is known as the Manwath murders case  in which Prakash s father Uttamrao Barhate and his permanently kept concubine Rukmanibai and 13 others were tried for the murders of 10 girls and women during the period from 14111972 to 4 111974 in Manwath village Prabhani district Maharashtra State.
The High Court considered the evidence and dismissed Criminal Appeal 38 of 1977 filed by the State for enhancement of the sentence of imprisonment for life awarded to accused 1 and 6 for the murder of Malan as also Criminal Appeal 7 of 1977 filed by accused 1 and 6 against their conviction and the sentence awarded to them.
In 784 that case the charge under section 120B IPC was framed against four named persons who had been arrayed as accused 1 to 4.
We are of the opinion that the retracted judicial confession of accused 5 could not be relied upon against accused 6 in this case in view of the fact that accused 6 who had been tried alongwith accused 5 had been acquitted by the High Court of the charge of conspiracy under section 302 read with section 120B IPC and accused 5 was not charged for the offence of murder of Malan for which only accused 1 6 and 7 were tried.
