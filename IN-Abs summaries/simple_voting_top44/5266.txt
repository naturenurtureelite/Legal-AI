R Pal BR Agarwala and Ms section Manchanda for the Respondent.
You cannot scratch a painting and not diminish its beauty.
 When the Court is called upon to give effect to the Directive Principle and the fundamental duty the Court is not to shrug its shoulders and say that priorities are a matter of policy and so it is a matter for the policy making authority.
In appropriate cases the Court may go further but how much further must depend on the circum stances of the case.
However the Court will not attempt to nicely balance relevant considerations.
We may now proceed to examine the facts of the present case.
There is in Calcutta a zoological garden located in Allipore now almost the heart of Calcutta on either side of Belvedere Road one of Calcutta s main arterial roads fortynine acres on one side and eight acres on the other.
This eight acre plot of land is known as the Begumbari land.
It is out of these eight acres that the land of the extent of four acres has been carved out and given to the Taj Group of Hotels for the construction of a Five Star Hotel.
In May 1980 the Taj Group of Hotels came forward with a suggestion that they would be able to construct a Five Star Hotel if any of three properties on Chowringhee specified by them was made available to them.
It was suggested that the Hastings House Property may be leased to the ITDC Group and the Begumbari property to the Taj Group of Hotels.
 It was stated that the Finance and Tourism Department had agreed to the proposal to lease the properties to the ITDC and the Taj Group respectively.
I agree.
The Chief Town Planner who was deputed to visit the site at the request of the Secretary Metropolitan Development Department and who visited the Zoo accompanied by the Director of the Zoo reported that 2 to 212 acres of land might be made avail able for the hotel.
