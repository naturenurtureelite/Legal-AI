The plaintiff therefore contended that defendant No 1 was a trespasser in the property and was liable to be evicted therefrom.
The lite is also the same.
The relief is only a consequence.
Sub rule 1 of Rule 2 inter alia provides that every suit shall include the whole of the claim which the plaintiff is entitled to make in respect of the cause of action.
Therefore the subsequent suit was based on a distinct cause of action not found in the former suit and hence we do not think that the High Court was right in concluding that the suit was barred by Order 2 Rule 23 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
In the previous suit the relief for possession was not claimed whereas in the second suit the relief was for restoration of possession.
Even in cases of threatened wrongful possession section 8A says that any tenant in possession of any land or dwelling house who apprehends that he may be dispossessed contrary to the provisions of this Act may apply in the prescribed manner to the Mamlatdar for an order safeguarding his right to possession.
We are therefore of the opinion that it would be just and fair that the issue whether defendant No1 was a tenant in respect of the lands in question should be referred to the Mamlatdar for decision and after his decision is received by the Civil Court if the issue is held against defendant No1 the Civil Court may consider passing of a decree in eviction but if on the other hand he is held to be tenant the Civil Court may be required to dismiss the suit.
His remedy would therefore to be entirely under the Act.
We would like to make it clear that the hypothetical situations may or may not apply to the fact situation that may emanate of the pleadings in this case and it would be for the Trial Court to determine the course of action to be adopted in the light of the guidelines indicated hereinabove.
