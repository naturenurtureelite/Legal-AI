Section 13 of the Amending Act deleted section 33 of the Act.
A plain consequence of this deletion was that the Panchayat Samitis were divested of their power to make appointments to the Panchayats.
Being aggrieved by his absorption on a lower post he filed a writ petition in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana asking that he should be absorbed as a Head Clerk.
The writ petition having been dismissed by the High Court the appellant has filed this appeal by special leave.
He was therefore entitled to be absorbed in Government service as a clerk in any event.
737 It is urged by Shri Jain who appears on behalf of the appellant that by reason of section 144 of the Amending Act the appellant was entitled to continue in the service of the Panchayat on the same terms and conditions on which he was employed by the Panchayat Samiti until he was absorbed in Government service.
Since the appellant according to the terms and conditions of his service with the Panchayat was entitled to be considered for promotion to the post of a Head Clerk his appointment as a Head Clerk prior to his absorption in Government service had to be recognised and protected despite the fact that such appointment was made after June 13 1973 when the Amending Act came into force.
Clearly it had fortified that right on June 13 1973.
He was appointed lawfully to the post of a Clerk and that is the post in which the Government has absorbed him.
There will be no order as to costs.
