After referring to the decisions in Gibson vs Barlon2 Edmonds vs Foster3 and Park vs Lawton4 where it was held that a person charged with an offence could not rely on his own default as an answer to the charge and so if the person charged was responsible for not calling the general meeting he cannot be heard to say in defence to the charge that the general meeting had not been called and that the company and its officers were bound to perform the condition precedent if they could do that in order that they might perform their duty this Court considered that as the correct view to take.
4 5 6 7  J 92  8 AIR 413 High Court India Nutriments Ltd vs Registrar of Companies1 and PSNSA Chettiar  Company vs Registrar of Companies2 of the Madras High Court.
The Orissa High Court had taken a similar view in Registrar of Companies vs Misra 3 but in a latter decision in Vulcan Industries P Ltd vs Registrar of Companies Orissa4 it has taken a contrary view and followed the decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in the judgment under appeal.
Solicitor General who appeared for the State of Andhra Pradesh and the learned Solicitor General who appeared for the Advocate General of Andhra Pradesh fairly placed before this Court all the decisions for and against which we have already referred to and also placed before us all the relevant considerations.
supra that a company or its directors in a prosecution under section 32 and section 133 of the 1913 Act could not in defence to such prosecution rely upon their own 415 failure to call the general body meeting applies with equal force to a prosecution under section 134 of the Act.
The appeal is dismissed.
