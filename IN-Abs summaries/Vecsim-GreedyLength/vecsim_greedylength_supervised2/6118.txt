Civil No 548 of 1987.
Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India.
During the period of training the trainees are paid a stipend by the Corporation.
Apart from giving training the Corporation also ensures marketing support to the artisans and craftsmen by purchasing their products at remunerative prices and sell them through the marketing network of the Corporation.
Article 14 permits reasonable classification rounded on rational basis.
Apart from that the Court has expressly observed that the higher pay scale to avoid stagnation or resultant frustration for lack of promotional avenues may also be allowed.
His case was based on the allegations that he was discharging same duties and performing similar functions as Senior Speech Therapist Senior Physiotherapist Senior Occupa tional Therapist Audiologist and Speech Pathologist.
But the Court held that the principle of equal pay for equal work cannot be invoked invariably in every kind of service particularly in the area of professional services.
If the classification has reasonable nexus with the objective sought to be achieved efficiency in the administration the State would be justified in prescribing different pay scales.
But it follows naturally that equal pay for unequal work will be a negation of that right Thus the law relating to equal pay for equal work has been practically hammered out and very little remains for further innovation.
We have carefully perused the material on record and gave our anxious consideration to the question urged.
A comparison cannot be made with counterparts in other establishments with different management or even in establishments in different geographical locations though owned by the same master.
As to the claim for regularisation of services of the peti tioners 669 we express no opinion since the factual data is disputed and is insufficient.
