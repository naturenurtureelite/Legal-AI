Civil Appeal No 159 of 1974.
Thereafter the appellant prayed before the High Court that his application dated 1 2 1971 might be treated as an application for setting aside the abatement of the appeal and the ground for setting aside the abatement was that the appellant did not know about the death of Som Dass at the time he died.
When Som Dass died the interest which was the subject matter of the suit devolved upon Shiam Das as he was elected to be the Mahant of the Dera and the appeal could be continued under Q 22 r 10 of the Civil Procedure Code against the person upon whom the interest had devolved.
 This rule is based on the principle that trial of a suit cannot be brought to an end merely because the interest of a party in the subject matter of the suit has devolved upon another during the pendency of the suit but that suit may be continued against the person acquiring the interest with the leave of the Court.
 We also see no reason why the High Court should not have granted leave to the appellant to prosecute the appeal.
