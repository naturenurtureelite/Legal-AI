As we have noticed this Court was not dealing there with the provisions of section 134 of 1913 Act which corresponds to section 220 of the 1956 Act.

4 5 6 7  J 92  8 AIR 413 High Court India Nutriments Ltd vs Registrar of Companies1 and PSNSA Chettiar  Company vs Registrar of Companies2 of the Madras High Court.
6 have also taken a similar view.
5 AIR 1969 Patna 445  1970 40 CC 17.
6 1961 KLJ 490.
7 ILR 1918 Calcutta 486.
9 1934 35 39 Calcutta Weekly Notes 1152.
 In this state of difference of opinion among the various High Courts and the absence of a decision of this Court on section 134 this appeal has been filed.
supra that a company or its directors in a prosecution under section 32 and section 133 of the 1913 Act could not in defence to such prosecution rely upon their own 415 failure to call the general body meeting applies with equal force to a prosecution under section 134 of the Act.
But section 134 lays down that after balance sheet and profit and loss account or the income and expenditure account as the case may be have been laid before the company at the general meeting three copies thereof shall be filed with the registrar and a failure to do so is made punishable under sub section 4 of that section.
We say nothing about section 32 about which this Court has already laid down the law.
VPS Appeal dismissed.
