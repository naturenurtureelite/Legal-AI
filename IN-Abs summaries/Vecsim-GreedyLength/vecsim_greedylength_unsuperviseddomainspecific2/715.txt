Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated the February 4 1955 of the Bombay High Court in Criminal Appeal No 1256 of 1954 arising out of the judgment and order dated June 19 1954 of the Chief Presidency Magistrate Bombay in Case No 176S of 1953.
Hardayal Hardy for the appellants.
H J Umrigar and B H Dhebar for the respondent.
April 21.
All conciliation proceedings under this sub section shall be deemed to have concluded in the case where no settlement is reached when the report of the Conciliation Officer is received by the appropriate Government.
It was next contended that on this interpretation the conciliation proceedings could be prolonged much beyond what was contemplated by the Act and the termination would depend upon how soon a report is received by the appropriate Government.
He is required to bring about settlement between the parties and must begin his investigation without delay and if no settlement is arrived at he is to submit his report to the appropriate Government.
No doubt section 12 contemplates that the report should be made and the proceedings closed within a fortnight and if proceedings are not closed but are carried on as they were in the present case or if the Conciliation Officer does not make his report within 14 days he may be guilty of a breach of duty but in law the proceedings do not automatically come to an end after 14 days but only terminate as provided in section 202b of the Act.
Appeal dismissed.
