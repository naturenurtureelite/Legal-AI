Civil No 548 of 1987.
Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India.
In this petition under Article 32 of the Constitution they are seeking enforcement of their fundamental right to have equal pay for equal work.
The Corporation has clearly stated that there are no regular employees of the petitioners  categories in its establishment and as such the question of payment to the petitioners the pay admissible to regular employees does not arise.
A little more information about the purpose and object of the Corporation would be useful for proper understanding of the case.
Apart from giving training the Corporation also ensures marketing support to the artisans and craftsmen by purchasing their products at remunerative prices and sell them through the marketing network of the Corporation.
Article 14 permits reasonable classification rounded on rational basis.
Apart from that the Court has expressly observed that the higher pay scale to avoid stagnation or resultant frustration for lack of promotional avenues may also be allowed.
But the Court held that the principle of equal pay for equal work cannot be invoked invariably in every kind of service particularly in the area of professional services.
But it follows naturally that equal pay for unequal work will be a negation of that right Thus the law relating to equal pay for equal work has been practically hammered out and very little remains for further innovation.
A comparison cannot be made with counterparts in other establishments with different management or even in establishments in different geographical locations though owned by the same master.
As to the claim for regularisation of services of the peti tioners 669 we express no opinion since the factual data is disputed and is insufficient.
