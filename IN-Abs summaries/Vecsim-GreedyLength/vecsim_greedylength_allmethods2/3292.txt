Civil Appeal No 159 of 1974.
488 N N Goswamy and Arvind Minocha for the appellant.
 489 We do not think that the view of the High Court was correct.
2 The attachment of a decree pending an appeal there from shall be deemed to be an interest entitling the person who procured such attachment to the benefit of sub rule 1.
 This rule is based on the principle that trial of a suit cannot be brought to an end merely because the interest of a party in the subject matter of the suit has devolved upon another during the pendency of the suit but that suit may be continued against the person acquiring the interest with the leave of the Court.
 We also see no reason why the High Court should not have granted leave to the appellant to prosecute the appeal.
