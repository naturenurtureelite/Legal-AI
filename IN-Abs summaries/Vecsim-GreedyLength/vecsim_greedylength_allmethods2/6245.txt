RK Garg SP Singh NM Popli RB Misra Uma Nath Misra and RC Kaushik for the Appellants.
RB Mehrotra for the Respondent.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MISRA J.
Special leave granted.
On the requisition of the State Government the State Public Service Commission had undertaken the recruitment to the post of Upper Zila Basic Shiksha Adhikari Women District Inspectress of Girls SchoolsAssociate Regional Inspectress of Girls Schools in Uttar Pradesh Educational Service Junior Scale Women s Branch The advertisement inviting applications from eligible candidates was published on May 5 1985 and a corrigendum was published on June 8 1985.
The recruitment examination was in two stages written and interviewpersonality test.
After the written examina tion was over on the basis of the results thereof success ful candidates upto a base limit have to be called to be interviewed.
On account of improper feeding into the comput er some of the candidates who had better performance in the written examination were not called and candidates securing lesser marks in the written examination were not only called for interview but were also finally selected.
The High Court has upheld the action of the Public Service Commission and has dismissed the writ petitions.
On the other hand the situation could have been appropriately met by setting aside the recruitment and asking for a 126 fresh interview of all eligible candidates on the basis of the written examination and select those who on the basis of the written and the freshly held interview became eligible for selection.
In lieu thereof we direct that the results of the written examination shall stand sustained and shall form the basis for the interview part of the recruitment and on the basis of the two examinations and in terms of the recruit ment rules fresh selections shall be made.
On the facts alleged we direct that the recruitment which is now to be re done by completing the interview examination should be finalised within four months hence.
There shall be no order as to costs.
TNA Appeals allowed.
