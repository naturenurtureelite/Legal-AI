C No 677 of 1988.
Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India.
In this petition under Article 32 of the Constitution the petitioners have questioned the con stitutional validity of Section 5 of the 12 of 1919 hereinafter called the Act .
In other words it is intended to control over the traffic in poisons.
In exercise of this power by the Notification No F 104472 fin.
G dated 781973 the Lt Governor of Delhi amended the Delhi Poisons Rules 1926 hereinafter called the Rules by including to the list of substances included in the Rules as Poisons the substance commonly known 222 as thinner  containing spirit and other soluble material such as shellac in which the percentage of such soluble material does not exceed 30 as poison and consequential amendment of rules 12 and 13 of the Rules.
 According to them therefore the substance manufactured by them would not come within the amended Rules.
Though in the beginning the petitioners were contending that in substance manufactured by them did not come within Rule 2x2 and there were some correspondence in this regard when the competent authority held that the substance manufactured by the petitioners would come within the definition of thinner  as contained in Rule 2x2 of the Rules the petitioners did not question the finding on any material.
Before us also they had not placed any materi al to show that the finding was wrong or that the substance would not come within Rule 2x2.
In fact the learned counsel argued the petition on the basis that the petition ers are a manufacturer of thinner  within Rule 2x2 which has been declared as poison for purposes of the Act.
 It was a law in force in the territory of India before the commencement of the Constitution and as such continued in force.
223 That Section enables the State Government to make Rules generally to carry out the purposes and objects of the Act.
A substance may be a deadly poison or a valuable medicine according to how and how much is taken.
If the resultant effect of administering into the system pro duces a violent morbid or fatal changes or which destroys living tissues the substance can be safely called poison.
Any substance which is used for purposes mentioned therein can definitely be declared as poison.
It has become a notorious fact which we can even take judicial notice of that the substance known as thinner  as it is or mixing with some other substances are taken as intoxicating spirits endangering the life.
In many cases deaths have also occurred due to drinking such substance.
If the Government thought in the circumstances that the posses sion or sale of the same is to be regulated it could not be said that they have no power to regulate.
Every such box almirah room or building and every receptacle shall be marked with the word poison  in red charac ters both English and vernacular and in the case of receptacles containing separate poison  with the name of such poison .
ii All poisons  mentioned in clause x of rule 2 shall be kept in a room or building according to quantity maintained which shall be secured by lock and key in a separate receptacle of glass metal and earthenware etc.
Every such room building and every such receptacle shall be marked with the word poison  in red character both English and vernacular with the name of the poison .
 We are not impressed with the argument that any require ment in this Rule is unreasonable or offends the petition ers  right to carry on any trade or business.
A law in such circumstance can regulate the trade.
It is also not necessary that the same substance should be declared as poison for the entire country.
Rule nisi is discharged.
No order as to costs.
