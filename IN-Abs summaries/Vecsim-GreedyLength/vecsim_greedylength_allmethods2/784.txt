1 Saving of rights of certain lessees and others.
2 The person whose right has been terminated by the Government under the foregoing proviso shall be entitled to compensation from the Government which shall be determined by the Board of 557 Revenue in such manner as may be prescribed having regard to the value of the right and the unexpired portion of the period for which the right was created.
2 of section 20 of the Abolition Act.
According to the argument the third proviso is not an independent proviso but is a sort of proviso to the second proviso.
 The argument of the petitioners is that the words  such rights  in the third proviso have reference to the rights created after the 1st July 1945 mentioned in the previous proviso and on that construction the lease in favour of the petitioners could be terminated only in accordance with that proviso by giving three months  notice.
 It is pointed out that the attention of the Madras High Court was not drawn to the rule framed by the Governor of Madras in exercise of powers conferred on him by section 67 1 and 2 of the Abolition Act.
Any order passed by the Board of Revenue under this rule shall be subject to revision by the Government.
