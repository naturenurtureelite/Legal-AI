The only mode of removal of a Judge from his office on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity is laid down in clauses 4 and 5 of Article 124.
It is farthest from our mind that a Judge of the Supreme Court or that of the High Court will be immune from prosecu tion for criminal offences committed during the tenure of his office under the provisions of the Prevention of Corrup tion Act.
The Judge as a con stitutional functionary being appointed by the President can only be removed by mandatory procedure provided under Arti cle 124 of the Constitution and in no other manner.
Section 6 creates a bar to the court from taking cogni zance of offences therein enumerated except with the previous sanction of the authority set out in clause a b  c of sub sec.
Clause a of Section 61 covers public servants employed in connection with the affairs of the Union.
The authority competent to give prior sanction for prosecution of such persons would be the State Government.
 If we take the early English law it will be seen that the corruption on the part of a Judge was the most reprehen sible crime and punishable as high treason.
