The Punjab Panchayat Samitis Zilla Parishads Haryana Amendment Act 1973 introduced extensive amendments in the Act of 1961.
Section 13 of the Amending Act deleted section 33 of the Act.

The Amending Act received the assent of the Governor 736 on April 25 1973 and was published in the Haryana Gazette on June 13 1973.
Section 353 which dealt with the conditions of service of the Government servants allotted to the Panchayat Samitis was amended by section 14 of the Amending Act of 1973.
