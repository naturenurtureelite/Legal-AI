The learned Judges of the High Court thought that the effect of the item was to exclude from the Sunri caste those who belonged to that caste but bore the surname Saha.
Nobody disputes that.
That also follows from the fact that the Constitution Scheduled Castes Order 1950 was promulgated to indicate those castes who are to be considered as Scheduled Castes for the purpose of the Constitution.
Sunri in item 40 therefore.
refers to a caste.
It is legitimate to think that when a statute says that a thing is to be excluded from another both things are of the same kind if one is a caste.
Therefore the correct interpretation of the item is that it indicates men of the Sunri caste but not those within that caste who formed the smaller caste group of Sahas.
The error of the Tribunal lay in interpreting the Order in the light of the evidence before it.
There was no justification for doing that.
After all the evidence led in a case may be imperfect.
A method of interpreting a statutory provision which might lead to such uncertainty cannot be correct.
That being so the election petition must fail.
One set of hearing fees only.
Appeal No 931 of 1965 allowed.
