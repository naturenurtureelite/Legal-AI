When a suit is brought by or against a person in a representative capacity and there is a devolution of the interest of the representative the rule that has to be applied is Order 22 rule 10 and not rule 3 or 4 whether the devolution takes place as a consequence of death or for any other reason.
Order 22 rule 10 is not confined to devolution of interest of a party by death it also applies if the head of the mutt or manager of the temple resigns his office or is removed from office.
The subject matter of the suit was the interest of Som Dass in the Dera and its properties and it devolved upon shiam Dass by virtue of his election as mahant subsequent to the death of Som Dass.
In Roshan Lal vs Kapur Chand the Court took the view that newly appointed trustees are not legal representatives of the trustees who had filed the suit and thereafter died during the pendency of the suit that they can be added as parties under Order 22 rule 10 notwithstanding the fact that the period of limitation for an application to 491 impleaded them under Order 22 rule 3 had elapsed.
