The main ground which was before the High Court was as to whether the provisions of UP Urban Buildings Regulation of Letting Rent and Eviction Act 1972  Act  for short will be applicable to these proceedings in view of the fact that although the premises were let out in June 1976 but as the assessment was made on October 1 1976 the provisions of the Act referred to above will not apply for 10 years from October 1 1976 and therefore the suit could be decreed as the protection available under this Act will not be available to the tenant.
vs Dig Vijendrapal Gupta etc.
Learned counsel further contended that in the decision in Vineet Kumar s case supra on which reliance has been placed by learned counsel for the appellant the Firms Amar Naath Basheshar Dass s case supra has not been referred to and decision in Vineet Kumar s case supra is a judgment by a Bench of two Judges.
Learned counsel for the appellant contended that the decision in 161 Firms Amar Nath Basheshar Dass s case supra will not be applicable to the present case as in that case this Court was considering the language of a notification issued under the East Punjab Act exempting buildings from the operation of the Act for five years and the view taken by this Court in that decision is based on the language of the notification issued whereas in view of the language of Sections 39 and 40 of the Act which is applicable to the present case that view is not possible and it is because of this that in Vineet Kumar s case supra this Court took the view that if during the pendency of the proceedings 10 years have elapsed the tenant will be entitled to the benefit of the provisions of the Act.
2 of the Act reads as under 2 Except as provided in sub section 5 of Section 12 sub section 1 A of Section 21 sub section 2 of Section 84 Sections 24 A 24 B 24 C or sub section 3 of Section 29 nothing in this Act shall apply to a building during a period of ten years from the date on which its construction is completed Provided that where any building is constructed substantially out of funds obtained by way of loan or advance from the State Government or the Life Insurance Corporation of India or a bank or a co operative society or the Uttar Pradesh Avas Evam Vikas Parishad and the period of repayment of such loan or advance exceeds the aforesaid 162 period of ten years then the reference in this sub section to the period of ten years shall be deemed to be a reference to the period of fifteen years or the period ending with the date of actual repayment of such loan or advance including interest whichever is shorter Explanation I For the purposes of this sub section a the construction of a building shall be deemed to have been completed on the date on which the completion thereof is reported to or otherwise recorded by the local authority having jurisdiction and in the case of a building subject to assessment the date on which the first assessment thereof comes into effect and where the said dates are different the earliest of the said dates and in the absence of any such report record or assessment the date on which it is actually occupied not including occupation merely for the purposes of supervising the construction or guarding the building under construction for the first time Provided that there may be different dates of completion of construction in respect of different parts of a building which are either designed as separate units or are occupied separately by the landlord and one or more tenants or by different tenants bconstruction includes any new construction in place of an existing building which has been wholly or substantially demolished c where such substantial addition is made to an existing building that the existing building becomes only a minor part thereof the whole of the building including the existing building shall be deemed to be constructed on the date of completion of the said addition.
This period of 10 years have to be computed in the manner from the date as indicated in Explanation 1 and it was contended by learned counsel for the respondents that it will be the date on which the first assessment was made and so far as this question is concerned it is also concluded by a decision of this Court in Om 163 Prakash Gupta s case supra where it has been clearly held while interpreting Sec.
2 sub clause 2 quoted above.
Pending suits for eviction relating to buildings brought under regulation for the first time In any suit for eviction of a tenant from any building to which the old Act did not apply pending on the date of commencement of this Act where the tenant within one month from such date of commencement or from the date of his knowledge of the pendency of the suit whichever be later deposits in the court before which the suit is pending the entire amount of rent and damages for use and occupation such damages for use and occupation being calculated at the same rate as rent together with interest thereon at the rate of nine cent per annum and the landlord s full cost of the suit no decree for eviction shall be passed except on any of the grounds 164 mentioned in the proviso to sub section 1 or in clauses b A to g of sub section 2 of Section 20 and the parties shall be entitled to make necessary amendment in their pleadings and to adduce additional evidence where necessary Provided that a tenant the rent payable by whom does not exceed twenty five rupees per month need not deposit any interest as aforesaid It is pertinent to note that this Section applies to those suits which were pending on the date of the commencement of this Act.
Admittedly this Act came into force on 15th July 1972 and therefore if the suit was pending on that date it is only then that the provisions of Section 39 will come to the assistance of the tenant appellant.
Admittedly the suit itself was filed much after the coming into force of this Act.
Section 20 of the new Rent Act provides a bar to a suit for eviction of a tenant except on the specified grounds as provided in the section.
a to sub section.
Section 39 and 40 of the new Rent Act also indicate that the benefit of new Act will be given 166 to the tenant if the conditions contemplated in those sections are satisfied.
The restriction on the right of a landlord to evict a tenant has been provided for in this Act under Section 20 and the language of Section 20 is also significant.
Bar of suit for eviction of tenant except on specified grounds 1 Save as provided in sub section 2 no suit shall be instituted for the eviction of a tenant from a building notwithstanding the determination of his tenancy by efflux of time or on the expiration of a notice to quit or in any other manner Provided that nothing in this sub section shall bar a suit for the eviction of a tenant on the determination of his tenancy by efflux of time where the tenancy for a fixed term was entered into by or in pursuance of a compromise or adjustment arrived at with reference to a suit appeal revision or execution proceedings which is either recorded in court or otherwise reduced to writing and signed by the tenant.
 This clearly indicates that the restriction put under Section 20 is to the institution of the suit itself and therefore it is clear that if the provisions of this Act applies then no suit for eviction can be instituted except on the grounds specified in the sub sections of this Section.
We therefore direct that the decree for eviction shall not be executed upto 3 1st March 1988 on the appellant filing a usual undertaking within four weeks.
SL Appeal dismissed.
