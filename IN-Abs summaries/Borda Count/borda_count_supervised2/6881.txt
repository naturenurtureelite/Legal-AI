Delay condoned.
In Atam Prakash s case this Court therefore held that what was said about the right of pre emption granted to co sharers in relation to Article 1911 of the Constitution applied with equal force to justify the classification in relation to Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution.
The 1905 Act was repealed and replaced by the 1913 Act.
Accord ing to section 15 of this Act before its amendment in1960 in the case of sale of a share out of joint land or proper ty the right of preemption was conferred firstly on the lineal descendents of the vendor in order of succession secondly in the co sharers if any who are agnates in order of succession thirdly in persons not included under firstly or secondly above in order of succession who but for such sale would be entitled on death of the vendor to inherit the land or property sold and fourthly in the co sharers.
This Court never intended to exclude any speci fied co owners from the scope of clause fourthly of section 151b of the Act.
The relations in the first three clauses of section 151b may or may not be co sharers The use of the expression other  in clause fourthly conveys the possibility of their being co sharer also.
What this Court disapproved as offen sive to Articles 14 and 15 is the classification based on consanguinity and not on co ownership.
That would clearly be discriminatory.
We think on a proper construction of that clause after the preceding clauses were held to be unconsti tutional the word other  preceding.
