 Further it appears that the Tribunal intended to grant the increase of Rs 150 to each draughtsman and Rs 100 to all other workmen in their basic pay.
However this is not clearly mentioned anywhere in the award due to accidental slip or omission.
The same has been made clear in paragraph No 23 but it appears that the words to each employee after the figure Rs 150  were omitted.
Similarly the same words to each employee after the figure 100 were omitted.
When the award is sent for publication a necessary corrigendum be made in the award and the aforesaid words after the figures Rs 150 and Rs 100 be added.
It may be mentioned that only from that point of view viz to grant flat increase of Rs 150 and of Rs 100 to the employees in the category of Draftsmen and the other categories respectively that a burden statement was called for from the company and the same was submitted vide exhibit C 51.
The fitment has also to be done only after the flat increase is added to the present basic salary of each employee.
I do not think that any problem would arise for interpretation of the award.
Since the award has been already signed I do not think anything further can be added to this award.
The amendment made by the Tribunal has the effect of providing a second increase this time to each individual workmen.
The statement afforded an indication merely of what the additional financial load would be if a flat increase was given to the individual workman on the alternative basis set forth therein.
None of the alternatives was actually adopted by the Tribunal because when the award was made the Tribunal proceeded instead to restructure the wage scales by the addition of Rs 150 in the case of the category of Draughtsmen and Rs 100 in the case of other categories to the initial pay in the wage scales pertaining to those categories.
The addition was integrated as a feature of the wage scales it was not regarded as an addition to the pay of each individual workman.
The second contention of the appellant is entitled to succeed.
The only contention of the workmen is that the Tribunal should have fixed the dearness allowance in communion with the cost of living index.
Civil Appeal No 2300 of 1979 is dismissed.
There is no order as to costs.
CHINNAPPA REDDY J We have had the advantage of perusing the judgment prepared by our learned brother Pathak J we agree with 180 him that Civil Appeal No 2300 of 1979 should be dismissed.
In the said award Your Honour has observed at the end of Para 22 In view of the increase that is being allowed in the basic pay I do not propose to revise the existing scheme of Dearness Allowance .
Further it appears that the Tribunal intended to grant the increase of Rs 150 to each draughtsman and Rs 100 to all other workmen in their basic pay.
However this is not clearly mentioned anywhere in the award due to accidental slip or omission.
Thereafter the Tribunal made an order on the same day in the following terms There can be no doubt that a flat increase of Rs 150 to each of the employees in the category of Draftsmen and 181 of Rs 100 to each employee in the other categories has been granted under my award.
The same has been made clear in paragraph No 23 but it appears that the words to each employee after the figure Rs 150  were omitted.
Similarly the same words to each employee after the figure 100 were omitted.
When the award is sent for publication a necessary corrigendum be made in the award and the aforesaid words after the figures Rs 150 and Rs 100 be added.
It may be mentioned that only from that point of view viz to grant flat increase of Rs 150 and of Rs 100 to the employees in the category of Draftsmen and the other categories respectively that a burden statement was called for from the company and the same was submitted vide exhibit C 51.
The fitment has also to be done only after the flat increase is added to the present basic salary of each employee.
I do not think that any problem would arise for interpretation of the award.
Since the award has been already signed I do not think anything further can be added to this award.
Even so we propose to examine whether the correction sought by the employees union was within the bounds of the authority of the Tribunal or whether it was in effect a fresh award.
Implicit and intrinsically connected with the question of revision of the wage scales were the questions of fitment of employees into the wage scales and flat or ad hoc increase of salaries of workmen wherever considered necessary.
