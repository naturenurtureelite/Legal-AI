In regard to the question of limitation the authority did not decide the said question as a preliminary question because it held and in our opinion rightly that it was a mixed question of fact and law and so it had to be tried after recording evidence.
The terms in question need not be express and can be implied but they must be terms which arise out of the contract of employment and since an award made by an Industrial Tribunal cannot be said to amount to a contract of employment the wage structure prescribed by the award cannot fall within the definition prescribed by section 2vi.
We are not inclined to hold that even under the unamended definition of wages rates of remuneration prescribed by an award could not be included.
In dealing with the question of construing the unamended definition of the term wages it is essential to bear in mind the scope and character of the powers conferred on Industrial Tribunals when they deal with industrial disputes under the provisions of the Indus trial Disputes Act.
When an award is made and it prescribes a new wage structure in law the old contractual wage structure becomes inoperative and its place is taken by the wage structure prescribed by the award.
The amendment has merely clarified what in our opinion was included in the unamended definition itself.
In our opinion the Bombay view correctly represents the true legal position in the matter.
