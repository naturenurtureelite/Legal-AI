The appellant had in this petition prayed for the issue of a writ quashing the resolution dated April 6 1964 passed by the Standing Committee Zila Parishad Nagpur and for a writ of mandamus directing the Standing Committee not to interfere with the right of the appellant to impose and collect the octroi duty pursuant to its resolution dated February 25 1963.
should be got decided by the appropriate authority.
It is so decided by the majority.
Procedure for levying tax or fee.
We are concerned with Part ITT.
Fixing of octroi limits and nakas.
Rate of octroi Octroi may be levied by a panchayat after following the procedure prescribed in rules 3 and 4 on all or any of the goods specified in column 1 of Schedule 1 annexed to this Part which are imported into the octroi limits for consumption use or sale therein and at such rates as may be decided by it but not below the minimum and not exceeding the maximum rates specified in columns 2 and 3 respectively of that Schedule.
 Rules 30 31 32 and 33 deal with refund of octroi.
3 and 4.
The Collector may in particular cases enlarge the octroi limits or reduce the octroi limits and it would lead to great confusion if either of the things happens after the Panchayat had been collecting octroi duty within the octroi limits submitted by it to collector for approval.
We may here deal with a minor point which was mentioned in the course of arguments.
There is nothing in the language to warrant such a construction.
Accordingly.
