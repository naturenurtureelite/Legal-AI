Tax Reference Cases Nos 3 to 5 of 1975 Tax Reference under Section 257 of the Income tax Act 1961 made by the Income tax Appellate Tribunal Cuttack Bench Cuttack PA Francis Champat Rai and Miss A Subhashini for the Appellant.
 These references under s271 of the have been made by the Income Tax Appellate tribunal Cuttack Bench at the instance of the Commissioner of Wealth Tax Orissa for the opinion of this Court on the following question of law Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the Wealth Tax Officer was in law justified in including in the net wealth of the assessee interest due on accrual basis though not realised on the outstandings of the money lending business the accounts of the assessee being maintained on cash basis  The respondent assessee was assessed to wealth tax for the assessment years 1965 66 1966 67 and 1967 68 the respective valuation dates being March 31 1965 March 31 1966 and March 31 1967 in the status of a Hindu Undivided Family.
Of all the assets wherever located belonging to the assessee on the valuation date is in excess of the aggregate value of all the debts owed by the assessee on the valuation date  According to the scheme of the Wealth Tax Act the net wealth of an assessee has to be determined as it obtains on a particular date.
There is an obvious advantage in adopting as the valuation date the last day of a period which is also the relevant period under the Income Tax Act.
That appears plainly from the definition or net wealth which speaks of the aggregate value of all the assets belonging to the assessee on the valuation date.
That being so the conclusion is inescapable that even though the accounts of the assessee are maintained on cash basis interest due on accrual basis though not realised on the outstandings of the money lending business are liable to be included in the net wealth of the assessee.
In this view of the matter we approve of the opinion expressed by the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Vedrevu Venkappa Rao supra 311 and in Commissioner of Wealth Tax AP I vs Pachigolla Narasimha Rao1 and the Calcutta High Court in Dipti Kumar Basu vs Commissioner of Wealth Tax West Bengal2 and hold that the view taken by the Orissa High Court in Commissioner of Wealth tax vs Vysyaraju Badreenarayana Moorthy Raju Orissa supra and by the Karnataka High Court in A T Mirji vs Commissioner of Wealth Tax Karnataka3 cannot be accepted.
