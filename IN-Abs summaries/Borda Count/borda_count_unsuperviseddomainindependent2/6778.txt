From the Judgment and Order dated 27479 of the Madras High Court in Criminal Misc.
The extraordinary power which the Constitution has conferred on the President by article 2221 cannot be exercised in a manner which is calculated to defeat or destroy in one stroke the object and purpose of the various provisions conceived with such care to insulate the judiciary from the influence and pressures of the executive.
 AIR 1982 SC 149.
The concept of independence of judiciary is a noble concept which inspires the Constitutional Scheme and constitute the foundation on which rests the edifice of our democratic polity.
If we may again quote the eloquent words of Justice Krishna Iyer Independence of the judiciary is not genuflexion nor is it opposition to every proposition of Government.
It is neither judiciary made to opposition measure nor Government s pleasure.
vs Union of Inida  Ors etc.
 supra.
61c of the said act is necessary.
The appeal is therefore dismissed.
