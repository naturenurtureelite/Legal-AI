It is also said that when a market is established no licence to purchase or sell commercial crops will be granted or renewed in respect of any place situated within such distance from the market as may from time to time be fixed by the State Government and that nothing under the Act prevents the Government from fixing a long distance as a prohibited area with the result that a person who is having a licence to trade in and about the place where the market is fixed is deprived of his livelihood which is an unreasonable restriction upon his right to do business.
The relevant provisions may be noticed at this stage.
Section 14 says No trade allowance other than an allowance prescribed by rules or by laws made under this Act shall be made or received in a notified area by any person in any transaction in respect of the commercial crop or crops concerned and no Civil Court shall in any suit or proceeding arising out of any such transaction have regard to any trade allowance not so prescribed.
A market committee generally may make bye laws for the regulation of the business and conditions of trading therein and particularly it can make bye laws prescribing what are permissible trade allowances under the section.
If on the other hand mahimai  is a trade allowance the said part of the 109 bye law will be superfluous as the allowance falls within the terms of the section itself This leads us to the question whether  mahimai  is a trade allowance within the meaning of section 14 of the Act.
