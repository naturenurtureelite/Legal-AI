Sub section 2 of section 8 next provides that where any person as is referred to in section 4 deemed tenant has been evicted from the land on or after 1st July 1962 such person shall be entitled to recover immediate possession of the land in the manner prescribed by or under the Act unless the landlord proves that the termination of tenancy was in the manner authorised by section 9.
Even in cases of threatened wrongful possession section 8A says that any tenant in possession of any land or dwelling house who apprehends that he may be dispossessed contrary to the provisions of this Act may apply in the prescribed manner to the Mamlatdar for an order safeguarding his right to possession.
There can therefore be no doubt that after the Fifth Amendment became effective in regard to land used primarily for growing coconut trees and garden produce the jurisdiction of the civil court was ousted by virtue of section 582 of the Act.
In such a situation what procedure should the Civil Court follow  Now take a case where the entire dispute falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the special machinery under the Act and had the litigation commenced after the Fifth Amendment was brought into force it could not have been instituted in a Civil Court.
Before we answer those questions we must decide on the impact of the Fifth Amendment on pending litigation.
We are therefore of the opinion that it would be just and fair that the issue whether defendant No1 was a tenant in respect of the lands in question should be referred to the Mamlatdar for decision and after his decision is received by the Civil Court if the issue is held against defendant No1 the Civil Court may consider passing of a decree in eviction but if on the other hand he is held to be tenant the Civil Court may be required to dismiss the suit.
One further situation which may arise under the provisions of the Act may be taken note of.
