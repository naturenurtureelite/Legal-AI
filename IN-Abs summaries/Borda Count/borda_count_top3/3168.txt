If no balance sheet is laid before a general body there can be no question of that balance sheet not being adopted nor of complying with the requirements of the Sub section 2 of Section 134 of the Old Companies Act or Section 220 of the Act as the case may be while wilful omission to call a general body meeting and omit to lay the balance sheet and profit and loss account before it may expose the person responsible to punishment under other provisions of the Act it certainly does not make him liable udder aforesaid provisions.
Solicitor General who appeared for the State of Andhra Pradesh and the learned Solicitor General who appeared for the Advocate General of Andhra Pradesh fairly placed before this Court all the decisions for and against which we have already referred to and also placed before us all the relevant considerations.
But section 134 lays down that after balance sheet and profit and loss account or the income and expenditure account as the case may be have been laid before the company at the general meeting three copies thereof shall be filed with the registrar and a failure to do so is made punishable under sub section 4 of that section.
Therefore the condition precedent or the essential prerequisite of the balance sheet and the profit and loss account being laid before the general meeting of the company not being fulfilled the requirement of section 134 cannot be complied with.
The observations which we have extracted earlier will show that the submission on behalf of the prosecution that provisions 1 IRL  2 1911 1 KE 417 of section 26 show that the obligation to file the list is independent of the holding of the general meeting was accepted.
The appeal is dismissed.
VPS Appeal dismissed.
