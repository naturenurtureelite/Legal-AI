c Such increments shall not however exceed four in number.
After adjustments are made in accordance with clauses a b and c supra two further increments in the new scale will be added thereto for service for the two years 1951 and 1952.
ivSubject to rules i to iii a workman s basic pay in the scale provided by the Sastry award as modified shall be fixed in the following manner aA workman shall first be fitted into the scale of pay of Sastry award as modified by placing him at the stage in the Sastry award scale as modified equal to or next above his basic pay as on 1st January 1959 in the scale then in force in the bank concerned hereinafter called the Bank s scale.
c Such increments shall not however exceed four in number.
It will be seen from the above comparison of the provisions in the two awards that the substantial provisions of the Desai award are exactly the same as the provisions of the Sastry award as modified except i for changes necessitated by the fact that the Desai award was being given in 1962 and ii the provision in the Sastry award corresponding to sub cl.

The appellant bank s contention is that two further annual increments allowed under sub cl.
d cannot be permitted in view of cl.
But as we have held that in cl.
d of cl.
iv will take effect and give two annual increments for 1960 and 1961 which are beyond the date which we have accepted as the right date for purposes of cl.
But as stated by the Labour Appellate Tribunal when dealing with the Sastry award it was inherent in the Sastry award that increments for 1951 and 1952 should be provided after the basic pay was worked out as on January 31 1950.
ii has to be worked out as on January 1 1959 the two increments provided by sub cl.

iv which are beyond that date must 905 be given over and above what has been worked out under sub cls.

Therefore two increments under sub cl.

i and ii to mean.
d must always be given.

This interpretation is in accord with what was decided by this Court in Prakash Chand Mehra s case1 and that decision in our opinion would govern the interpretation of para.
5356 of the Desai award also which as we have indicated is in substance the same as para.
292 of the Sastry award as modified by the Labour Appellate decision.
We now turn to the actual fixation of pay in each case.
a of el.
iv his salary has to be fixed as on January 1 1959 at Rs 106.
He would not be entitled to any increments under sub cls.
d for the years 1960 and 1961 and his salary therefore as on January 1 1962 under the Sastry award would come to Rs 119.
The bank actually fixed him at Rs 176 on its own interpretation of the award.
Tek Chand Sharma respondent in CA 1009 was appointed on November 15 1950.
His salary as on January 1 1959 was Rs 100 and his place of posting was Nakodar in area IV of the 1 906 Sastry award.
a of cl.
He would not be entitled to any increments under sub cls.
iv because he was getting more than what would be his adjusted basic pay under cl.
a of cl.
The thirteenth stage in the Desai award scale is Rs 182 for that area.
We make no order as to costs in the circumstances.
