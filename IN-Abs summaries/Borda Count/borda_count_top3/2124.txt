The learned Judges of the High Court thought that the effect of the item was to exclude from the Sunri caste those who belonged to that caste but bore the surname Saha.
We are unable to agree with either of these interpretations.
Nobody disputes that.
Sunri in item 40 therefore.
the other must be a caste.
Now a thing can be 391 excluded from another only if it was otherwise within it.
This is where the Tribunal went wrong.
There was no justification for doing that.
In that case if the reasoning applied by the Tribunal is right it has to be held that the expression excluding Saha meant excluding a smaller caste group called Sahas.
A method of interpreting a statutory provision which might lead to such uncertainty cannot be correct.
The finding that Sahas were a wholly independent caste was altogether irrelevant to the point in issue.
We think the learned Judges of the High Court also interpreted item 40 in the light of the evidence in the case.
In the absence of such words Saha must in the context be understood as referring to a smaller caste group within the bigger caste group of Sunris.
It is nobody s case that there is evidence to show that.
