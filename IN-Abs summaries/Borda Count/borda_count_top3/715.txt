iminal Appeal No 46 of 1957.
Hardayal Hardy for the appellants.
April 21.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR J.
If the answer is in the affirmative then the appellants have been properly convicted and if not the conviction must be set aside.
From this it was submitted that as 14 days had expired before March 18 1952 the dismissal could not be said to be one within the words  pendency of conciliation proceedings .
The Act provides for commencement and conclusion of conciliation proceedings under section 20 but the first sub section of section 20 deals with what are called utility services and sub section 2 of that section provides as to when the conciliation proceedings conclude.
All conciliation proceedings under this sub section shall be deemed to have concluded in the case where no settlement is reached when the report of the Conciliation Officer is received by the appropriate Government.
It was contended that the conciliation proceedings should be held to terminate when the Conciliation Officer is required under section 126 of the Act to submit his report but the provisions of the Act above quoted do not support this contention as the termination of the conciliation proceedings is deemed to take place when the report is received by the appropriate Government.
This is how section 202b was interpreted in Workers of the Industry Colliery Dhanbad vs Management of the Industry Colliery 1.
Section 12 lays down the duties of the Conciliation officer.
He is required to bring about settlement between the parties and must begin his investigation without delay and if no settlement is arrived at he is to submit his report to the appropriate Government.
As the conciliation proceedings were pending at the time when Louis Pereira was dismissed the appellants were rightly convicted under section 311 read with section 33 of the Act.
The appeal is therefore dismissed.
