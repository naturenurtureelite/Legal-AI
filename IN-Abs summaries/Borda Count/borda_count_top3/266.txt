We thus hold that both section 34 of the Indian Income tax Act and sub section 4 of 462 section 5 of the impugned Act deal with all persons who have similar characteristics and similar properties the common characteristics being that they are persons who have not truly disclosed their income and have evaded payment of taxation on income.
So far as we can see these assessees have been given discriminatory treatment even from those whose cases are referred to under section 51 of the Act to the Commission inasmuch as in the case of persons whose cases are referred to under section 51 of the Act it is the prima facie belief of the Government that enables the reference to be made to the Commission and the Commission has after investigation to form an opinion while in the case of persons coming within the ambit of sub section 4 of section 5 the Commission itself finds and gathers reason to believe that these persons have evaded income tax and on its report the Government is bound to refer their cases to the same Commission who has.
already arrived at the prima facie conclusion that they have evaded payment of income tax.
Income tax Act.
A person who has evaded payment of income tax and is proceeded with under section 34 and is held to have escaped income tax has a right of appeal to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner of Income tax and can challenge all the findings of fact given by the Income tax Officer.
