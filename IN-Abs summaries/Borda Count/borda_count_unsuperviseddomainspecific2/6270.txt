Paragraph 2 of the said order of appointment issued on 20th August 1979 reads thus The appointment shah be on contract for a period of one 241 year wef.
the date of assumption if it is not terminated earlier by giving a one month s notice by the Hon ble Gover nor or on paying one month s salary in lieu thereof or by giving one month s notice by the Officer.
 The respondent was required to furnish his acceptance of the terms and conditions contained in the said order includ ing the above term relating to the period of appointment and on his accepting the terms and conditions he was appointed as the Secretary in the District Soldiers Board in the district of Unnao in the State of Uttar Pradesh .
The relevant part of the last of such orders namely the order dated 1st June 1983 reads as follows Sir With reference to your letter No 1020Sa.
the date mentioned in para 4 has expired.
No Name and Date of Date of Recommen place of appoint expiry dation appoint ment of con extend ment tract the contract 1to 12 13 Ex Pilot 21879 31383 1483 Arun Govil 30885 Unnao 14 to 21 242 2.
But on 2931985 the service of the 1st Respondent was terminated by the issue of a notice and payment of one month s salary.
The respondent aggrieved by the said order of termina tion filed a Writ Petition on the file of the High Court of Allahabad in Writ Petition No 3 164 of 1985.
In the instant case the respondent was entitled to be in service till 30th of Au guSt 1985 unless there was a further extention.
In the Penultimate paragraph of the judgment the High Court further stated It is open for the opposite parties to con sider the claim of the petitioner for continu ation in service or of fresh appointment and no observations in this regard are being made by this Court.
 The judgment was delivered on 2431988.
243 The respondent who was not satisfied by the order allow ing the Writ Petition as stated above preferred a Review Petition before the High Court contending that he was enti tled to be reinstated in service on the pronouncement of the Judgment on 243.
In support of the Review Petition the respondent relied on an interim order which had been passed by the High Court during the pendency of the Writ Petition on 10th of July 1986 which reads thus The post will be kept vacant and in case the petitioner succeeds in his Petition it would be made available forthwith to the petitioner by way of an appointment.
The High Court allowed the Review PetitiOn on 2671988 and made an order reinstating the Respondent in service which reads as follows This is an application for review of our Judgment dated 2431988 by which we allowed the Writ Petition filed by the Petitioner with certain directions.
It seems that when the writ petition was decided our attention was not drawn towards the interim order dated 1071986 passed by learned single Judge in which it was provided that one post will be kept vacant and in case the petitioner suc ceeds in his petition it would be made avail able forthwith to the petitioner by way of his appointment.
The appellant government never accepted the position that the respondent was entitled to be treated as a regular employee who had a vested right to continue to hold the post till he attained 58 years of age.
Since it is admitted that no order of extension had been sanctioned by the Governor beyond 30th August 1985 the respondent was entitled to the salary and allowances due to him till 30th of August 1985 if the order of termination of service served on him on 293.
1985 was found to be an invalid one.
It is on this basis that the High court had while setting aside the order of termination by its order dated 2431988 directed that the respondent was entitled to salary upto the period he was entitled to remain in service and further observed that it was open for the opposite parties to consider the claim of the respondent for continu ation in service or of fresh appointment and no observations in this regard were made by the Court.
A reading of the Judgment of the High Court dated 2431988 shows that the respondent had not urged before the High Court that the order of appointment issued in his case was not in the nature of a contract and the subsequent orders extending his period of appointment till 30th of August 1985 were liable to be ignored and that he should be treated as a person regularly appointed in Government service entitled to con tinue till he completed the age of 58 years.
Even the order passed on Review on 2671988 does not make out that the respondent had put forward at that stage such a case.
His only case was that the interim order that had been passed on 10786 entitled him to be reinstated in service even though there was no order of extension of service.
245 In the circumstances we feel that while the High Court was right in disposing of the Writ Petition on 243.
1988 declaring that the respondent was entitled to salary upto the period he was entitled to remain in service ie 30th August 1985 it was not right in making an order on Review on 2671988 relying upon the interim order dated 1071986 which in the circumstances could not have the effect of controlling the jurisdiction of the High Court to dispose of the Writ Petition on merits as it did on 2431988.
We therefore set aside the order dated 2671988 passed by the High Court on review and restore the Judgment dated 2431988 passed in the Writ Petition.
The order passed on review is wholly unsustainable.
We however make it clear that what we have stated above does not affect in any way what the High Court has stated in the penultimate paragraph of the Judgment dated 2431988 which reads thus It is open for the opposite parties to con sider the claim of the petitioner for continu ation in service or the fresh appointment and no observations in this regard are being made by this Court.
 The appeal is accordingly allowed.
No costs.
TNA Appeal allowed.
