Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India.
The petitioner of this application under Article 32 of the Constitution is an engineer who was employed in the Central Public Works Department under the Ministry of Works and Housing in Government of India and was compulsorily retired by order dated 381976 with effect from 5111976 made under Rule 56j of the Fundamental Rules.
He has assailed that order for retirement and has claimed payment of remuneration which he would have been entitled to draw upto the normal date of superannuation.

He was pro moted as officiating Assistant Engineer in class II service with effect from  255.
On 371961 he was further promoted as officiating Executive Engineer in Class I service but on 491965 he was reverted to the post of Assistant Engineer in officiating position and was con tinuing in that post when he was compulsorily retired.

Admittedly he was holding a class II post when the impugned order was served on him.
Therefore sub clause 1 was not contravened when the order was made.
The sole question that fell therein for decision before this Court was whether a Government servant officiating in Class I or Class II service or post could be retired compulsorily by exercising the power under Rule 56ji after he has attained the age of 50 years.
In short an officiating Govern ment servant does not really belong to Class I or Class II service until he acquires a right thereon.
Learned counsel for the petitioner does not dispute the position that a person who is in Class I or Class II service or post is in such service or post as covered by sub clause i.
If the officia tion is not brought to an end by reverting the Government servant to his substantive post before the power of compul sory retirement is exercised the Government servant con cerned must be taken to be in Class I or Class II service or post at the relevant time and would come within the ambit of sub clause i.
The possibility of a reversion to the substantive post is not germane to the exercise of power contained in FR 56.
1976 and 292.
There will be no order for costs.
