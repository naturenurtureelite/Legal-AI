The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS GUPTA J.
Ms.
In their return of turnover for the period from April 1 1954 to March 31 1955 they claimed exemption from Sales Tax in respect of sales of cotton of the total value of Rs 68493 2 6 and sales of castor oil of the total value of Rs 647509 1 6 on the ground that these sales were oil FOB contracts under which they continued to be the owners of the goods till the goods had crossed the customs barrier and thus entered the export stream and so no tax was realisable on these sales in view of the provisions of article 286 1b.
The notice of demand for the total sales tax and the purchase tax assessed was served on the sellers on September 30 1956.
In this view the learned Judge dismissed the application under article 226.
Against this decision the sellers appealed.
The 927 learned Judges who heard the appeal held disagreeing with the Trial Judge that the goods remained the sellers  property till the goods had been brought on board the ship and so the sales were exempted from tax under article 2861b of the Constitution.
11 and 13 of the writ petition that these sales were made on FOB basis were not denied in the counter affidavit sworn by the Sales Tax Officer.
As has however been rightly stressed by the learned Solicitor General it is always open to the parties to come to a different agreement as to when the Dropert in the goods shall pass.
This in our opinion shows nothing.
We think that the learned judges who heard the appeal in the Bombay High Court were right in their conclusion that the goods remained the sellers  property till the goods had been brought and loaded on board the ship and so the sales were exempted from tax under article 2861b of the Constitution.
Appeals dismissed.
