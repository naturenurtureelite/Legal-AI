That decision is also pending in appeal before this Court.
The punishment under these sections is for default in filing copies of the balance sheet or the profit and loss account which are laid before a general body and for not sending a statement of the fact that the balance sheet was not adopted.
If no general body meeting is held the persons concerned cannot be said to have committed a default in complying with those provisions.
 In this state of difference of opinion among the various High Courts and the absence of a decision of this Court on section 134 this appeal has been filed.
Though the respondent was not represented before this Court the learned Addl.
It also provides that the company shall forthwith file with the registrar a copy of the list and summary and any default hi complying with the requirements of the section is made punishable.
Under section 131 the laying of a balance sheet and profit and loss account before the company in the general meeting is made obligatory.
But section 134 lays down that after balance sheet and profit and loss account or the income and expenditure account as the case may be have been laid before the company at the general meeting three copies thereof shall be filed with the registrar and a failure to do so is made punishable under sub section 4 of that section.
The responsibility of sending three copies of the balance sheet and profit and loss account or the income and expenditure account as the case may be arises only after they have been laid before the company at the general meeting.
We say nothing about section 32 about which this Court has already laid down the law.
VPS Appeal dismissed.
