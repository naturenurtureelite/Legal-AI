February 28.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMA AYYAR J.
It was part of his duties to disburse the wages to the workmen employed in the works and the procedure usually followed was that be drew the amount required from the treasury and paid the same to the emplo yees against their signatures or thumb impressions in the monthly acquittance roll.
The First Class Magistrate of Patiala before whom the appellant was put up for trial framed charges against him under section 465 of the Indian Penal Code for forging the thumb impression of Parma and under section 409 of the Indian Penal Code for criminal misappropriation of Rs 51 and after a full trial 167 1304 acquitted him.
This appeal by special leave is directed against this judgment.

Quite recently this Court had to consider in Shreekantiah Ramayya Munipalli vs The State of Bombay1 the necessity for sanction under section 1971 when the charge was one of misappropriation under section 409.
There the law was laid down in the following terms The section has content and its language must be given meaning.
What it says is When any public servant  is accused of any offence alleged to have been committed by him while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty .
We have therefore first to concentrate on the word offence .
Now an offence seldom consists of a single act.
1309 urged on behalf of the respondent.
In Hori Ram Singh vs Emperor1 the medicines had not been entered in the stock book and were removed by the accused to his residence and the charge against him was that in so removing them he had committed MISappropriation.
He contended that the conviction was illegal for want of sanction but the Privy Council following H H B Gill vs The King1 rejected this contention.
Clearly therefore sanction was required under section 1971 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before the appellant could be prosecuted under section 409 and the absence of such sanc tion is fatal to the maintainability of the prosecution.
Appeal allowed.
