Mr Iyengar for the appellant has strongly urged before us that since these facts are established the court must presume the valid execution of the will and in support of his contention he has invited our attention to the relevant statements on the point in the text books dealing with the subject.
Take for instance the statement in the will that the testatrix had advanced Rs 3000 to her son to enable him to purchase a house at Mysore.
In this connection he referred us to certain documents exhibited under exhibit I G  and attempted to show that the lands given to his sisters  daughters were of the value of Rs 1500 to Rs 2000 each.
There is one more point which must be considered in this connection.
The sixth was whether the testator knew and approved of the residuary clause and by this last clause the propounders of the will were made the residuary legatees and were appointed executors.
In confirming the view of the High Court the Privy Council made the observations to which we have just referred.

The scribe PW 3 is a near relation of Kalbagal and even he does not at all support the appellant s case about previous instruction because according to him the testatrix said that she would agree to whatever the appellant would get written.
