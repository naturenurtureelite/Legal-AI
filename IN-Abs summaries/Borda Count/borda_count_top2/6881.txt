Appeal No 4366 of 1991.
Delay condoned.
This Court therefore upheld the constitutional validity of clause fourthly of section 151a clauses fourthly  and fifthly  of section 151b and clause fourthly of section 151c as valid and not infringing Articles 14 or 15 of the Constitution This Court however did not find any justification for the classification contained m section 15 which conferred a right of pre emption on the kinsfolk.
In taking this view strong reliance was placed on the ratio of the decision of this court in Bhau Ram vs.
B Baijnath Singh  wherein the vires of a provision of the Rewa State Pre emption Act which conferred a right of pre emption based on vicinage and the right of preemption conferred on co sharers and the Punjab Pre emption Act 1913 were challenged on the ground of infraction of Article 191 f of the Constitu tion.
In that case also this Court held that the right of pre emption vested in co shar ers was a reasonable restriction on the right to hold acquire or dispose of property conferred by Article 1911 of the Constitution.
We find it diffi cult to hold that the purport of the of Court s decision in Attam Prakash s case was to deny the right of pre emption to those relative or relatives of the vendor or vendors who were specified in the erstwhile first three clauses of section 151b even if they happen to be co sharers.
the word co sharer  is rendered redundant.
We therefore do not approve the ratio of Jagdish s case and overrule the same.
