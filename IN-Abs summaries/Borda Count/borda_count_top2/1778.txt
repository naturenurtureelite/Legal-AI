March 24 1964.
The point which we have to decide in the present appeal is whether the remuneration payable under an award was not already included in the definition of wages before the said definition was amended.
In spite of the award and the agreement the appellant paid its employees only As.
 10  per day and that led to the present claim made by the respondents under section 15 of the Act.
The High Court has affirmed the finding of the authority and held that section 15 was applicable to the case because the wages prescribed by the award did amount to wages as defined by section 2vi of the Act.
The terms in question need not be express and can be implied but they must be terms which arise out of the contract of employment and since an award made by an Industrial Tribunal cannot be said to amount to a contract of employment the wage structure prescribed by the award cannot fall within the definition prescribed by section 2vi.
That in brief is the substance of the argument raised by the appellant.
The true legal position is that when industrial disputes are decided by industrial adjudication and awards are made the said awards supplant contractual terms in respect of matters covered by them and are substituted for them.
In our opinion the Bombay view correctly represents the true legal position in the matter.
Appeal dismissed 1 AIR 1951 Cal 29.
