The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Hidayatullah CJ.

It provided 3.
It is said that the period 118 is to be extended by another 5 years.
The Rules were made on March 21 1959.
They are called the Andhra Pradesh Public Employment Requirement as to Residence Rules 1959.
 The petitioners were appointed between December 27 1956 and July 4 1968.
For this reason section 3 of the Act is challenged as ultra vires the Constitution.
119 Article 16 on which the Act the Rules and the present action are all based reads  16.
4    5   .
The first clause emphasises that ware shall be in India equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters of employment or appointment to any office under the late.
The second clause then specifies a prohibition against discrimination only on the grounds of religion race sex descent place of birth residence or any of them.
This clause was amended by the Constitution Seventh Amendment Act 1956.
any requirement as to residence within the State or Union territory prior to employment or appointment to an office in that State or Union territory.
Firstly whether Parliament  while prescribing the requirement may prescribe the requirement of residence in a particular part of the State and secondly whether Par liament can delegate this function by making a declaration and leaving the details to be filled in by the rule making power of the Central or State Governments.
Having used the word State the unit State is only meant and not any part thereof.
On the other hand Mr Setalvad bases his argument on two things.
He contends that the power is given to Parliament to make any law and therefore Parliament is supreme and can make any law on the subject as the article says.
121 The claim for supremacy of Parliament is misconceived.
Where the Constitution does not concede supremacy Parliament must act within its appointed functions and not transgress them.
Realising however that sometimes local sentiments may have to be respected or sometimes an inroad from more advance States into less developed States may have to be prevented and a residential qualification may therefore have to be prescribed the exception in clause 3 was made.
Even so that clause spoke of residence within the State.
The words any requirement  cannot be read to warrant something which could have been said more specifically.
These words bear upon the kind of residence or its duration rather than its location within the State.
We accept the argument of Mr Gupte that the Constitution as it stands speaks of a whole State as the venue for residential qualification and it is impossible to think that the Constituent Assembly was thinking of residence in Districts Taluqas cities towns or villages.
The fact that this clause is an exception and came as an amendment must dictate that a narrow construction upon the exception should be placed as indeed the debates in the Constituent Assembly also seem to indicate.
This point is not raised by the petitions under consideration and no expression of opinion by us is desirable.
The petitions shall be allowed but there shall be no order about costs.
