The Judgment of the Court was delivered by ALAGIRISWAMI J.
Referring to the decision of the Bombay High Court in that case this Court pointed out that decision turned on section 134 of the Companies Act 1913 the language of which was to a certain extent different from the language used in sections 32 and 131 and refrained from going into the question whether the difference in language in section 134 on the one hand and sections 32 and 131 on the other made any difference to the decision of the case.
8 10 AIR 1948 Calcutta 42.
If no balance sheet is laid before a general body there can be no question of that balance sheet not being adopted nor of complying with the requirements of the Sub section 2 of Section 134 of the Old Companies Act or Section 220 of the Act as the case may be while wilful omission to call a general body meeting and omit to lay the balance sheet and profit and loss account before it may expose the person responsible to punishment under other provisions of the Act it certainly does not make him liable udder aforesaid provisions.
But section 134 lays down that after balance sheet and profit and loss account or the income and expenditure account as the case may be have been laid before the company at the general meeting three copies thereof shall be filed with the registrar and a failure to do so is made punishable under sub section 4 of that section.
A different offence might have been committed either under section 762 or under section 1333.
It is clear therefore that on principle and authority it should be held that no offence was committed by the directors in this case under section 134.
The appeal is dismissed.
VPS Appeal dismissed.
