section B Sen Additional Government Advocate for the State of Madhya Pradesh and I N Shroff for Intervener No 4 1958.
October 6.
The Act was passed to provide for the better regulation of the buying and selling of commercial crops in the State of Madras and for that purpose to establish markets and make Rules for their proper administration.
The Market Committees.
The appellants in the above three appeals and others filed writ petitions in the High Court of Madras against 1 the State of Madras 2 the Collectors of the concerned Districts and 3 the Chairmen of the Market Committees for the issue of a Writ of Mandamus directing the respondents to forbear from enforcing any or all the provisions of the Act as amended and the Rules and Bylaws framed thereunder.
g of el.
Under proviso to sub section.
Section 14 says No trade allowance other than an allowance prescribed by rules or by laws made under this Act shall be made or received in a notified area by any person in any transaction in respect of the commercial crop or crops concerned and no Civil Court shall in any suit or proceeding arising out of any such transaction have regard to any trade allowance not so prescribed.
If on the other hand mahimai  is a trade allowance the said part of the 109 bye law will be superfluous as the allowance falls within the terms of the section itself This leads us to the question whether  mahimai  is a trade allowance within the meaning of section 14 of the Act.
Appeals dismissed.
