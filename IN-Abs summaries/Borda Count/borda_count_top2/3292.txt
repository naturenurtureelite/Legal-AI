The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MATHEW J.
Against that decree an appeal was preferred by the appellant to the High Court.
While the appeal was pending in the High Court Som Dass the defendant died on 13 10 1970.
The suit was filed on the basis that the appellant as the lawfully appointed mahant was entitled to manage the properties of the Dera at Landeke that the defendant was unlawfully claiming to be the mahant of the Dera and entitled to manage the properties of the Dera and that the appellant was entitled to be in possession of the properties.
When a suit is brought by or against a person in a representative capacity and there is a devolution of the interest of the representative the rule that has to be applied is Order 22 rule 10 and not rule 3 or 4 whether the devolution takes place as a consequence of death or for any other reason.
We see no force in this argument.
We are of the view that devolution of the interest in the subject matter of the suit took place when Shiam Dass was elected as mahant of the Dera after the death of Som Dass.
