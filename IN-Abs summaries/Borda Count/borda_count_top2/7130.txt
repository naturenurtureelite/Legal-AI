Appeal No 1695 of 1993.
It is against this order of the High Court that the present appeal by special leave is preferred.
The first ground on which the High Court dismissed the suit is that the suit was barred by the principle of res judicata in view of the dismissal of the former suit No 15768.
That suit however came to be dismissed as the Trial Court came to the conclusion that the plaintiff was no more in possession of the property in respect of which he claimed to be a lessee.
In the previous suit the relief for possession was not claimed whereas in the second suit the relief was for restoration of possession.
Sub section 2 of section 8 next provides that where any person as is referred to in section 4 deemed tenant has been evicted from the land on or after 1st July 1962 such person shall be entitled to recover immediate possession of the land in the manner prescribed by or under the Act unless the landlord proves that the termination of tenancy was in the manner authorised by section 9.
In such a situation what procedure should the Civil Court follow  Now take a case where the entire dispute falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the special machinery under the Act and had the litigation commenced after the Fifth Amendment was brought into force it could not have been instituted in a Civil Court.
He therefore sought possession of the demised property from the trespasser defendant No1.
We are therefore of the opinion that it would be just and fair that the issue whether defendant No1 was a tenant in respect of the lands in question should be referred to the Mamlatdar for decision and after his decision is received by the Civil Court if the issue is held against defendant No1 the Civil Court may consider passing of a decree in eviction but if on the other hand he is held to be tenant the Civil Court may be required to dismiss the suit.
