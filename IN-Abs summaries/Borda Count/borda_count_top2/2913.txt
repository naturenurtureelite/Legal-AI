Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated January 17 1967 of the Patna High Court in CWJC No 952 of 1966.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Hegde J.
The assessee is having construction contracts under the Railways as well as the Government.
It is a partnership firm.
The assessee also produced before him a statement showing various creditors from whom it had borrowed on Hundis during the accounting year in question.
After enquiry the assessee s total income was assessed at Rs 69886 .
As we are accepting the contention of the assessee that the impugned notice is invalid inasmuch as it did not comply with the requirements of section 1512 of the Act we have not thought it necessary to examine the other contentions advanced on behalf of the assessee.
At this stage we need not refer to that section  We shall refer to that provision at a later stage.
When the appeal was taken up for hearing on the 18th January 1971 only the report submitted by the Income tax Officer to the Commissioner and the order of the Commissioner was produced.
Name and address of the assessee MS Chugamal Rajpal Muzaffarpur.

Sd section P Chaliha 30 4 66.
 In his report the Income tax Officer does not set out any reason for coming to the conclusion that this is a fit case to issue notice under section 148.
The material that he had before him for issuing notice under section 148 is not mentioned in the report.
He does not mention the facts contained in those communications.
All that he says is that from those communications it appears that these persons alleged creditors are name lenders and the transactions are bogus.
He has not even come to a prima facie conclusion 447 that the transactions to which he referred are not genuine transactions.
From the report submitted by the Income tax Officer to the Commissioner it is clear that he could not have had reasons to believe that by reason of the assessee s omission to disclose fully and truly all material  facts necessary for his assessment for the accounting year in question income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for that year nor could it be said that he as a consequence of information in his possession had reasons to believe that the income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for that year.

Therefore he could not have issued a notice under section 148.
Both of them appear to have taken the duty imposed on them under those provisions as of little importance.
They have substituted the form for the substance.
The Respondent No 2 shall pay the costs of the appellant both in this Court and in the High Court.
GC Appeal allowed.
