N C Chatterjee Janaradan Sharma K B Rohtagi and section Balakrishnan for the appellant in CA No 931 of 1965 and the respondent in C A No 1149 of 1965.
These appeals arise out of an election to a seat in the West Bengal Legislative Assembly from the Khargram Murshidabad constitutency reserved for members of the Scheduled Castes.
The objection was rejected by the Returning Officer.
At the hearing of the petition by the Election Tribunal however he challenged the election only on the ground that Abhoy Pada was a member of the Saha caste and not a member of a Scheduled Caste.
article 341 gives power to the President to specify by public notification the castes or parts of or groups within castes which shall for the purpose of the Constitution be deemed to be Scheduled Castes.
The question is whether the appellant was a member of the Scheduled Caste specified in this item.
In the election petition the respondent had stated that the appellant was a member of the Saha caste and not a member of any Schedule Caste.
The High Court also read the petition in the same way.
Nobody disputes that.
refers to a caste.
the other must be a caste.
One set of hearing fees only.
