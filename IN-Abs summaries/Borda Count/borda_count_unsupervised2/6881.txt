RKKapoor and Anis Ahmed Khan for the Appellant.
Delay condoned.
Special leave granted.
The right of pre emption granted to a tenant was taken as another instance of a legislation aimed at protecting the tenant s interest in the land.
Read in the context it becomes clear that the legislature desired to confer the right of pre emption on specified family members of the vendor or vendors in the first three clauses of section 151b and with a view to covering all the remaining co sharers not specifically mentioned the preceding clauses it used the expression other co sharers  in the fourth clause which was meant to serve as a residuary clause to ensure 127 that no co sharer is left out.
Since this Court found certain intrinsic contradictions in the list of relatives covered by the first three clauses it saw no justification for the classification contained in the said provision conferring a right based on consanguinity and therefore struck down those clausesas discriminatory and violative of Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution.
At the same time it upheld the right conferred on co sharers for reasons stated earlier.
We find it diffi cult to hold that the purport of the of Court s decision in Attam Prakash s case was to deny the right of pre emption to those relative or relatives of the vendor or vendors who were specified in the erstwhile first three clauses of section 151b even if they happen to be co sharers.
That would clearly be discriminatory.
There will be no order as to costs throughout.
VPR Appeal allowed.
