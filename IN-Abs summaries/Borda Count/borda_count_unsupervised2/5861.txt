The Judgment of the Court was delivered by JAGANNATHA SHETTY J.
It is said that it would be violative of the Constitutional right of equal pay for equal work.
The facts are not in dispute.
They will be found correctly stated in the judgment under appeal and may briefly be stated thus Prior to 1965 in the High Court of Allahabad Bench Secretaries were on a higher pay scale than that of Section Officers.
In 1965 the State Government appointed a Pay Rationalisation Committee with wide ranging reference.
The Committee was asked to consider the duties and responsibilities of different categories of posts.
The Committee submitted a detailed report in which Bench Secretaries became casualties.
The State Government accepted the recommendations.
The Bench Secretaries again moved the Government reiterating their demand.
