April 21.
On March 18 1952 the appellant dismissed Louis Pereira a bus conductor and proceedings were taken on a complaint by Assistant Commissioner of Labour under section 33 read with section 31 of the Act against 5 accused persons the two appellants and the partners of appellant No 1.
The two appellants have appealed by special leave.
Section 331 pro K vides section 331  During the pendency of any conciliation proceedings before a conciliation officer or a Board or of any proceeding before a Labour Court or Tribunal or National Tribunal in respect of an industrial dispute no employer shall a in regard to any matter connected with the dispute alter to the prejudice of the workmen concerned in such dispute the conditions of service applicable to them immediately before the commencement of such proceedings or b for any misconduct connected with the dispute discharge or punish whether by dismissal or otherwise any workmen concerned in such dispute save with the express permission in writing of the authority before which the proceeding is pending .
The argument raised on behalf of the appellant is that the object of conciliation is to get a settlement made with expedition and therefore under section 12 the Conciliation Officer was bound to make his report within 14 days of the commencement of the conciliation proceedings or within such shorter period fixed by the appropriate Government.
All conciliation proceedings under this sub section shall be deemed to have concluded in the case where no settlement is reached when the report of the Conciliation Officer is received by the appropriate Government.
The conciliation proceedings therefore do not end when the report under section 12 6 is made by the Conciliation Officer but when that report is received by the appropriate Government.
Appeal dismissed.
