M C Setalvad and R C Prasad for the appellants.
The respondent did not appear.
March 24 1964.
In spite of the award and the agreement the appellant paid its employees only As.
The appellant raised two pleas against the respondents  claim.
Section 2vi as it stood at the relevant time provides inter alia that wages means all remuneration capable of being expressed in terms of money which would if the terms of the contract of employment express or implied were fulfilled be payable.
The terms in question need not be express and can be implied but they must be terms which arise out of the contract of employment and since an award made by an Industrial Tribunal cannot be said to amount to a contract of employment the wage structure prescribed by the award cannot fall within the definition prescribed by section 2vi.
That in brief is the substance of the argument raised by the appellant.
We are not inclined to hold that even under the unamended definition of wages rates of remuneration prescribed by an award could not be included.
Therefore the basic assumption made by Mr Setalvad in contending that section 2vi cannot take in the wages prescribed by the award is not well founded.
When an award is made and it prescribes a new wage structure in law the old contractual wage structure becomes inoperative and its place is taken by the wage structure prescribed by the award.
