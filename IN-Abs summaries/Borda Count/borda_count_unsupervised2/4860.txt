287  288 of 1980 Appeals by Special leave from the judgment and Order dated the 27th July  8th August 1979 of the Bombay High Court in Crl.
Appeal Nos 7 of 1977 and 605 of 1978.
781 VS Desai Mrs J Wad and Miss Aruna Mathur for the Appellants.
OP Rana K V Sree Kumar and MN Shroff for the Respondent.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VARADARAJAN J.
Now proceed to record our reasons.
Charge No 3 framed against accused 1 to 4 was under section 302 read with section 34 IPC on the allegation that in pursuance of the conspiracy and in furtherance of their common intention they committed the murder of Parubai on or about 29111975.
Therefore his conviction and sentence awarded to him have become final.
In 784 that case the charge under section 120B IPC was framed against four named persons who had been arrayed as accused 1 to 4.
The High Court acquitted accused 2 to 4 and convicted accused 1 alone of that charge and sentenced him holding that he and some others had conspired together and fabricated the deed of assignment put forward by accused 1 and that accused 1 alone could not have fabricated that document.
We were therefore not called upon to consider any such question.
