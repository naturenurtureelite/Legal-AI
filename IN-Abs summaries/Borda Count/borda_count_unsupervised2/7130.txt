Appeal No 1695 of 1993.
Taneja for the Respondents.
The Judgment of Court was delivered by AHMADI J Special leave granted.
On the dismissal of the said suit the original plaintiff filed another suit No 11474 on May 6 1974 for restoration of possession on the ground that he was the lawful tenant of the said property and since he had not been dispossessedin accordance with law the defen dants who were mere trespassers were liable to be evicted.
He therefore sought possession of the property in respect of which he claimed to be a lessee.
That suit however came to be dismissed as the Trial Court came to the conclusion that the plaintiff was no more in possession of the property in respect of which he claimed to be a lessee.
The lite is also the same.
Hence the relief by itself is neither material nor relevant for the direct adjudication of the real issue.
As stated earlier the first suit was dismissed on a technical ground that the suit for a mere declaration without seeking consequential relief of possession could not lie.
Rule 2 thereof requires that the plaintiff shall include the whole of his claim in the framing of the suit.
To preclude the plaintiff from so doing it is provided that if he omits any part of the claim or fails to claim a remedy available to him in respect of that cause of action he will thereafter be precluded from so doing in any subsequent litigation that he may commence if he has not obtained the prior permission of the court.
Therefore the cause of action for the former suit was based on an apprehension that the defendants were likely to forcibly dispossess the plaintiff.
suit was not identical to the relief claimed in the previous suit.
That makes all the difference.
Before we answer those questions we must decide on the impact of the Fifth Amendment on pending litigation.
He therefore sought possession of the demised property from the trespasser defendant No1.
