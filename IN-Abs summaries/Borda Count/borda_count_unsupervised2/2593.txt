P K Chatterjee and section P Nayar for the appellant.
I N Shroff for respondent No 1.
section K Dholakia and Vineet Kumar for respondent No 2.
This appeal by special leave arises out of the suit filed by Bhaishankar Avalram Joshi hereinafter referred to as the plaintiff for a declaration that the order of dismissal dated February 24 1955 passed by the Inspector General of Prisons Saurashtra was illegal and void on the ground that it contravened the provisions of article 311 2 of the Constitution.
The plaintiff appealed to the High Court claiming arrears of salary and the State of Bombay filed cross objections praying that the suit be dismissed.
There will be a further provision in the decree that the liability arising out of the declaration that the appellant is in Government service is the liability of the State of Gujarat and that the liability for the payment of the arrears of pay is the liability of the State of Maharashtra.
On March 7 1954 he was served with a charge sheet.
 The plaintiff filed a written statement.
In the plaint the plaintiff alleged that copy of the enquiry report was never supplied to him and consequently he had not been given reasonable opportunity within the meaning of article 311 of the Constitution.
It seems to us that the High Court came to a correct conclu sion.
If the report was in his favour in his representation to the Government he would have utilised its reasoning to dissuade the Inspector General from coming to a contrary conclusion and if the report was against him he would have put such arguments or material as he could to dissuade the Inspector General from accepting the report of the Enquiry Officer.
That is the only purpose of the enquiry held by competent officer and the report he makes as a result of the said enquiry.
922 of Maharashtra and the State of Gujarat or in default of such agreement as the Central Government may by order direct.
