160 to 162 of 1960.
A number of other articles were also seized at that time but we are not concerned with them as they have no connection with the charges against the appellant.
In so far as section 52 of the Act is concerned the argument is that the prosecution having merely shown that the registered letters were recovered from an almirah in the house in which the appellant lives the 413 utmost that could be said is that he was in possession of letters that is assuming that he was in the exclusive possession of the house and the almirah.
To secrete means according to the dictionary to hide.
In connection with a postal article addressed to some person the fact that it is retained in his possession by an officer of the post office in an almirah and that too for an inordinately long period would be tantamount to hiding that 414 article.
Of course what act amounts to secreting would necessarily depend upon the facts of each case and in our opinion in a case like the present what has been established by the prosecution would sustain an inference of secreting.
Further a perusal of section 55 makes it clear that where the entrustment of an article is made an ingredient of an offence the legislature has used appropriate words to make the matter clear.
It seems to us that bearing in mind the  fact that an officer of the post office having in the course of his duties access to postal articles kept or lying in the post office the legislature has deliberately enlarged the scope of section 52 so as to encompass secretion destruction or throwing away of postal articles by an officer of the post office even though they may not have been entrusted to him or even though the are riot articles with which he is required or is competent to deal in the course of his duties.
The object of the provision is to prevent postal articles in course of transmission by post  from being tampered with and so the secreting destruction  etc of postal articles to which the provision is directed is to such secreting destruction etc as would frustrate or tend to frustrate their delivery to the addressees.
The expression in course of transmission by post has been defined in section 3 a of the Act as follows  lm15  a postal article shall be deemed to be in course of transmission by post from the time of its being delivered to a Post Office to the time of its being delivered to the addressee or of its being returned to the sender or otherwise disposed of under Chapter VII.
 The mere fact that there is even a delay of several months in delivering a postal article to the addressee would not mean that the article had ceased to be in course of transmission.
It is probably for this reason that the definition clearly lays down that until an article despatched by post is delivered or can be said to be delivered that it will be deemed to be in course of transmission.
We cannot therefore accept the first part of this contention of Mr Misra.
The addressees have been examined in this case and they have deposed that the letters in question were not received by them.
Their 416 evidence has been believed by the High Court and therefore there is an end to the matter.
2 that at least nine of those postal articles were addressed to the respondent himself vide exhibit Ka 9 serial No 66 3 that Dewan Singh who we are informed is a very old man would not foist the said incriminating articles on his son and thus ruin his career for ever and 4 that the respondent alone can be said to have had some motive for secreting and concealing the registered letters and other postal articles in question.
 Before the High Court could take into consideration the circumstance that as between himself and his father the appellant had a better opportunity to 417 get at postal articles it had to find affirmatively that the almirah was in the exclusive possession of the appellant.
We have not been able to discover anything in the judgment which directly bears on this question.
That leaves therefore only the first reason.
But to say that he must be deemed to be in exclusive possession of these articles and not merely in their joint possession along with his father because he had the opportunity to get at the articles and then infer that he must have utilized the opportunity and was therefore in their exclusive possession would be arguing in a circle.
Indeed had it been so found he could have been convicted under section 52 without the Court having to consider whether he had secreted the articles.
But as already stated even an inference of joint possession would not be legitimate.
For these reasons we allow the three appeals and set aside the conviction and sentences passed against the appellant.
Appeal allowed.
