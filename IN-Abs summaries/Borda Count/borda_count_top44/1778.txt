The terms in question need not be express and can be implied but they must be terms which arise out of the contract of employment and since an award made by an Industrial Tribunal cannot be said to amount to a contract of employment the wage structure prescribed by the award cannot fall within the definition prescribed by section 2vi.
That in brief is the substance of the argument raised by the appellant.
In dealing with the question of construing the unamended definition of the term wages it is essential to bear in mind the scope and character of the powers conferred on Industrial Tribunals when they deal with industrial disputes under the provisions of the Indus trial Disputes Act.
When an award is made and it prescribes a new wage structure in law the old contractual wage structure becomes inoperative and its place is taken by the wage structure prescribed by the award.
The true legal position is that when industrial disputes are decided by industrial adjudication and awards are made the said awards supplant contractual terms in respect of matters covered by them and are substituted for them.
In our opinion the Bombay view correctly represents the true legal position in the matter.
The matter will now go back to the authority under the Act for disposal in accordance with law.
There would be no order as to costs.
