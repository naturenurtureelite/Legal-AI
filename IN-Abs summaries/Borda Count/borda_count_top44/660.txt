Apart from the fact that the value of these lands is not clearly proved nor are the circumstances under which they came to be gifted to the donees we 57 450 do not think it would be possible to accept the argument that even with these gifts the testatrix would not have thought of making more substantial bequests to her grand children.
The two rules of law set out by Baron Parke are  first that the onus probandi lies in every case upon the party propounding a will and lie must satisfy the conscience of the court that the instrument so propounded is the last will of a free and capable testator the second is that if a party writes or prepares a will under which he takes a benefit that is a circumstance that ought generally to excite the suspicion of the court and calls upon it to be vigilant and zealous in examining the evidence in support of the instrument in favour of which it ought not to pronounce unless the suspicion is removed and it is judicially satisfied that the paper propounded does express the true will of the deceased .
This evidence does not strike us as natural or probable but apart from it even Kalbagal s evidence does not show satisfactorily that the will was read out to the testatrix so as to enable her to understand its full effect before it was signed by her.
