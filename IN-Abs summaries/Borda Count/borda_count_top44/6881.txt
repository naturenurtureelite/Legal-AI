The 1905 Act was repealed and replaced by the 1913 Act.
Read in the context it becomes clear that the legislature desired to confer the right of pre emption on specified family members of the vendor or vendors in the first three clauses of section 151b and with a view to covering all the remaining co sharers not specifically mentioned the preceding clauses it used the expression other co sharers  in the fourth clause which was meant to serve as a residuary clause to ensure 127 that no co sharer is left out.
This Court never intended to exclude any speci fied co owners from the scope of clause fourthly of section 151b of the Act.
We find it diffi cult to hold that the purport of the of Court s decision in Attam Prakash s case was to deny the right of pre emption to those relative or relatives of the vendor or vendors who were specified in the erstwhile first three clauses of section 151b even if they happen to be co sharers.
The relations in the first three clauses of section 151b may or may not be co sharers The use of the expression other  in clause fourthly conveys the possibility of their being co sharer also.
What this Court disapproved as offen sive to Articles 14 and 15 is the classification based on consanguinity and not on co ownership.
That would clearly be discriminatory.
the word co sharer  is rendered redundant.
We therefore do not approve the ratio of Jagdish s case and overrule the same.
There will be no order as to costs throughout.
