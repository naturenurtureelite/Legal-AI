The Orissa High Court had taken a similar view in Registrar of Companies vs Misra 3 but in a latter decision in Vulcan Industries P Ltd vs Registrar of Companies Orissa4 it has taken a contrary view and followed the decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in the judgment under appeal.
6 have also taken a similar view.
Though the respondent was not represented before this Court the learned Addl.
Solicitor General who appeared for the State of Andhra Pradesh and the learned Solicitor General who appeared for the Advocate General of Andhra Pradesh fairly placed before this Court all the decisions for and against which we have already referred to and also placed before us all the relevant considerations.
Section 32 relates to the preparation of a list of members of the company and of persons who have ceased to be members as well as a summary and also provides that it shall be completed within 21 days after the day of the first or only ordinary general meeting in the year.
But section 134 lays down that after balance sheet and profit and loss account or the income and expenditure account as the case may be have been laid before the company at the general meeting three copies thereof shall be filed with the registrar and a failure to do so is made punishable under sub section 4 of that section.
Therefore the condition precedent or the essential prerequisite of the balance sheet and the profit and loss account being laid before the general meeting of the company not being fulfilled the requirement of section 134 cannot be complied with.
It is clear therefore that on principle and authority it should be held that no offence was committed by the directors in this case under section 134.
The appeal is dismissed.
