He also held that the evidence did not establish that the Sahas formed a sub caste strictly so called within the Sunri caste of a caste wholly independent of the Sunri caste.
The learned Judges of the High Court thought that the effect of the item was to exclude from the Sunri caste those who belonged to that caste but bore the surname Saha.
We are unable to agree with either of these interpretations.
Nobody disputes that.
Sunri in item 40 therefore.
refers to a caste.
Now a thing can be 391 excluded from another only if it was otherwise within it.
This is where the Tribunal went wrong.
There was no justification for doing that.
After all the evidence led in a case may be imperfect.
If the correct interpretation of item 40 was as we think it was that Sahas were a caste group within the Sunri caste no question of Sahas being a distinct class independent of Sunris could arise.
It is nobody s case that there is evidence to show that.
This question presents no difficulty.
The result then is that the appellant is a Sunri by caste and has not been proved to belong to the smaller caste group of Sahas.
Appeal No 931 of 1965 allowed.
