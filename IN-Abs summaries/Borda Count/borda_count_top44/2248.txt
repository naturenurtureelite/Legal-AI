Procedure for levying tax or fee.
A Panchayat shall with the approval of the Collector or of any officer authorised by the Collector not below the rank of Mamlatdar Tehsildar Naib Tehsildar or Mahalkari fix octroi limits and the number and location of octroi Nakas within 219 the limits of its jurisdiction.
Similarly r37 which deals with tax on pilgrims provides that the procedure prescribed in rr3 and 4 should be followed.
3 and 4.
Rule 71 which deals with tax on professions also contains a reference to rr 3 and 4.
It only deals with two items 1 selection of the tax and the rate at which it is to be levied.
Rule 3c has to be similarly read.
But the learned counsel for the Company Mr Ashok Sen argues that this interpretation is not correct because para 2 of r4 says that the tax shall accordingly be levied from the date which shall be specified in the notice and he says that if the octroi limits had not been approved of by the time the resolution is passed how could the tax be levied from the date specified in the notice.
In other words para 2 of r4.
We are however unable to agree with the learned counsel for the appellant that before the octroi limits are approved octroi can be collected.
Apart from the fact that it may in certain circumstances lead to illegal levies there is nothing in the language of r21 which indicates that the Collector can regularise an imposition made without the authority of law.
Rule 5 follows imme diately rr3 and 4 and is headed Appeal against levy of any tax or fee and the period of sixty days of limitation commences from the date of the publication of the notice under r4 ie the notice following the decision of a Panchayat to levy any tax or fee.
Accordingly.
GC Appeal allowed.
