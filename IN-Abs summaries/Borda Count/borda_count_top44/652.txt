October 6.
The Act was passed to provide for the better regulation of the buying and selling of commercial crops in the State of Madras and for that purpose to establish markets and make Rules for their proper administration.
No 356 Food  Agriculture Department dated March 81952 the Government directed the constitution of a Market Committee at Virudhunagar and markets at 1 Virudhunagar 2 Rajapalayan and 3 Sattur in Ramanathapuram District.
Till such markets are 102 established the said provisions by imposing licensing restrictions enable the buyers and sellers to meet in licensed premises ensure correct weighment make available to them reliable market information and provide for them a simple machinery for settlement of disputes.
It is also said that when a market is established no licence to purchase or sell commercial crops will be granted or renewed in respect of any place situated within such distance from the market as may from time to time be fixed by the State Government and that nothing under the Act prevents the Government from fixing a long distance as a prohibited area with the result that a person who is having a licence to trade in and about the place where the market is fixed is deprived of his livelihood which is an unreasonable restriction upon his right to do business.
While the object of the Act is to protect the growers the argument proceeds the small traders are compelled to resort to distant markets with the result that some of them would be forced to give up their business and others would have to incur unnecessary expenditure which they could not afford.
Appeals dismissed.
