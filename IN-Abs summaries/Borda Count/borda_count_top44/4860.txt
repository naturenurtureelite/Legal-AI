As state earlier Criminal Appeal 38 of 783 of 1977 was filed by the State for enhancement of the sentence of imprisonment for life awarded to accused 1 and 6 in respect of the murder of Malan and Criminal Appeal 605 of 1978 against the acquittal of accused 2 3 4 5 and 7 of charge No 1 framed under section 302 read with section 120B IPC Thus the acquittal of accused 1 and 6 of charge No 1 framed against them under section 302 read with section 120B IPC and of accused 1 to 3 of charge No 2 in respect of the murder of Ashamati and of accused 1 to 4 of charge No 3 in respect of the murder of Parubai became final.
Therefore his conviction and sentence awarded to him have become final.
Therefore the High Court did not place any reliance on this circumstance namely recovery of the blood stained shirt article 55 from the house of accused 6.
We are of the opinion that the retracted judicial confession of accused 5 could not be relied upon against accused 6 in this case in view of the fact that accused 6 who had been tried alongwith accused 5 had been acquitted by the High Court of the charge of conspiracy under section 302 read with section 120B IPC and accused 5 was not charged for the offence of murder of Malan for which only accused 1 6 and 7 were tried.
