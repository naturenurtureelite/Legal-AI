c Such increments shall not however exceed four in number.
In addition the workman will be entitled to draw his normal increment for 1953on 1st April 1963.
bTo the basic pay into which he is fitted under clause a annual increment or increment in scale provided by the Sastry award as modified as from that stage onwards should be added at the rate of one increment for every completed three years of his service in the same cadre as on 1st January 1959.
c Such increments shall not however exceed four in number.
It will be seen from the above comparison of the provisions in the two awards that the substantial provisions of the Desai award are exactly the same as the provisions of the Sastry award as modified except i for changes necessitated by the fact that the Desai award was being given in 1962 and ii the provision in the Sastry award corresponding to sub cl.
d of cl.
a b and c of cl.
d and that it did not matter whether what was thus arrived at exceeded the maximum provided under cl.
We are of opinion that neither the stand taken by the bank nor the stand taken by the workmen is correct and that the relevant clauses in para.
It is urged on behalf of the appellant that the Desai award made certain changes and therefore need not be interpreted in the same way as was done in Prakash Chand Mehra s case1.
iv which provides for actual calculations starts with the words subject to rules i to iii and therefore the actual calculations made under cl.
a b and c of cl.
a of cl.

iv but this will be subject to cls.

d of cl.
iv and the main dispute in the present case is about this subclause.
The appellant bank s contention is that two further annual increments allowed under sub cl.
But as we have held that in cl.
d of cl.
iv will take effect and give two annual increments for 1960 and 1961 which are beyond the date which we have accepted as the right date for purposes of cl.
ii provides cannot be given.
Once it is held and that we hold that basic pay under cl.
ii has to be worked out as on January 1 1959 the two increments provided by sub cl.
d of cl.
iv which are beyond that date must 905 be given over and above what has been worked out under sub cls.

iv of the Desai award.
d of el.
Therefore two increments under sub cl.
d have to be given after adjustments have been made under sub cls.
a b and c of el.
iv in accordance with what we have interpreted these sub clauses as well as cls.
i and ii to mean.
d must always be given.
b read with sub cl.
c may in some cases be not available where the actual pay as on January 1 1959 which will not be reduced under el.
This interpretation is in accord with what was decided by this Court in Prakash Chand Mehra s case1 and that decision in our opinion would govern the interpretation of para.
5356 of the Desai award also which as we have indicated is in substance the same as para.
292 of the Sastry award as modified by the Labour Appellate decision.
a of el.
iv his salary has to be fixed as on January 1 1959 at Rs 106.
He would not be entitled to any increments under sub cls.
d for the years 1960 and 1961 and his salary therefore as on January 1 1962 under the Sastry award would come to Rs 119.
As Rs 119 is the eleventh stage in the Sastry scale Ram Parkash would be entitled to the eleventh stage in the Desai scale which would be Rs 170.
The bank actually fixed him at Rs 176 on its own interpretation of the award.
a of cl.
He would not be entitled to any increments under sub cls.
a of cl.
We make no order as to costs in the circumstances.
