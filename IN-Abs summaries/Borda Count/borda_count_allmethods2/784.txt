A V Viswanatha Sastri V Vedantachari and K Sundararajan for the appellant.
August 14.
These three appeals are directed against the judgment and order pronounced by a Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court on November 20 1957 whereby three writ petitions namely No 1 of 1956 No 19 of 1957 and No 470 of 1957 which had been filed by the appellant and were heard together were dismissed with costs.
It is alleged that on January 10 1942 an agreement was entered into between the Rajah of Venkatagiri and one Sri Balumuri Nageswara Rao whereby the Rajah agreed to give annual leases in respect of certain slate quarries within his estate for five years in succession commencing from February 1942 if the Rajah was satisfied with the work carried on by the lessee during the preceding year.
The Board of Revenue submitted a report to the Government on October 20 1955 and the Government after considering the Board s report instructed the latter to dispose of the case on merits.
Thereupon the Board of Revenue passed an order on December 27 1955 declaring that the lease to the appellant had been granted subsequent to July 1 1945 and that as the lease was for a period exceeding one year it was not enforceable against the Government according to the second proviso to section 20 1 of the Abolition Act.
The appellant promptly filed writ petition No 1 of 1956 praying for the issue of a writ of mandamus directing the State of Andhra Pradesh to forbear from terminating his leasehold right in the slate quarries.
In the meantime on September 21 1955 the appellant had applied to the Board of Revenue Andhra for renewal of the lease under r 47 of the Mineral Concession Rules 1949.
The principal question canvassed before us is that the termination of the appellant s lease by the order dated December 27 1955 was bad as it did not give three months  notice to the appellant or provide for any compensation as required by section 20 of the Abolition Act.
Those provisions proceed on the assumption that certain laws passed under the Government of India Act 1935 did offend section 299 of that Act and expressly save those Acts.
2 of section 20 of the Abolition Act.
Under that sub section a person can claim compensation only when his right is terminated by the Government under the foregoing proviso.
2 which provide for compensation will not be attracted.
We start with this broad proposition.
The implications of the second proviso learned counsel for the appellant points out are two fold namely a that all rights created before the notified date but after July 1 1945 for a period not exceeding one year would be valid and enforceable both by and against the Government by the operation of the body of sub section.
