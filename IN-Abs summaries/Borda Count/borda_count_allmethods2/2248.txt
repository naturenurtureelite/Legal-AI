B R Agarwala and section B Nerkar for respondent No 1.
On June 1 1959 the Bombay Village Panchayat Act 1958 Bombay Act III of 1959 hereinafter referred to as the Act came into effect in Vidharba region and by virtue of this Act the appellant was deemed to be a Panchayat under the Act.
Procedure for levying tax or fee.
Payment of octroi on introduction of goods etc.
Rule 7 which deals with tax on buildings and lands also prescribes that the panchayat shall follow the procedure prescribed in rr3 and 4 before levying a tax on buildings and lands.
Similarly r37 which deals with tax on pilgrims provides that the procedure prescribed in rr3 and 4 should be followed.
3 and 4.
Rule 93 which deals with fee on cartstands and tonga stands makes the procedure in rr3 and 4 appli cable.
It only deals with two items 1 selection of the tax and the rate at which it is to be levied.
Rule 3c has to be similarly read.
The inhabitants of the village would be entitled to object only to these two matters namely 1 the tax or fee imposed and the rate at which it is levied.
Under r3d what the panchayat does is to consider objections and suggestions and then finally make the choice as regards two things ie the tax or fee to be imposed and the rate at which it is to be levied.
In other words para 2 of r4.
We are however unable to agree with the learned counsel for the appellant that before the octroi limits are approved octroi can be collected.
The Collector may in particular cases enlarge the octroi limits or reduce the octroi limits and it would lead to great confusion if either of the things happens after the Panchayat had been collecting octroi duty within the octroi limits submitted by it to collector for approval.
Accordingly.
