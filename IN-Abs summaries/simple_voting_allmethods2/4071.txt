section K Gambhir for RR.
For the purpose of holding election to the .
It was also notified that claims or objections which had not been preferred as required under the Rules within the prescribed period would be rejected.
The final publication of the electoral roll under Rule 8 of the Rules was done on November 16 1978.
Thereafter the calendar of events was published on November 25 1978 notifying that the poll if necessary would take place on December 31 1978 in all the 44 constituencies Six petitioners including the appellants herein presented a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Jabalpur on December 28 1978 requesting the Court to make an order quashing the electoral roll and the calendar of events issued for the purpose of the said election and directing the respondents to refrain from conducting the poll on December 31 1978.
They prayed for a further direction to be issued to the respondents calling upon them to hold the election after preparing the electoral roll afresh in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the Rules.
They also prayed for the issue of an interim order staying the poll which had been fixed to be held on December 31 1978.
On December 30 1978 the learned Single Judge before whom the case came up for orders directed the issue of notice of the petition and the stay application to the respondents and issued an interim order directing the respondents not to notify the results of the election under Rule 46 of the Rules pending disposal of the petition.
On December 31 1978 the poll was held and 44 persons were declared elected.
Aggrieved by the order passed by the High Court Ashok Kumar Mishra and Bhagwat Singh Thakur Petitioners No 1 and 5 respectively in the 494 petition before the High Court filed a petition for special leave to appeal to this Court and Purshottam Lal Sharma petitioner No 6 before the High Court filed another petition.
One of the grounds on which the appellants challenged the validity of the electoral roll the calendar of events and the declaration of results of election was that the entire election process had become vitiated on account of the defect in the notice issued under Rule 1 of the Rules notifying that claims and objections should be preferred within a period of 20 days from the date of the publication of that notice when sub rule 3 of Rule 4 of the Rules prescribed that such claims and objections could be preferred within 30 days from the date of publication of that notice.
It was also alleged that on October 20 1978 34 persons mentioned in Annexure P 7 approached the Deputy Collector to entertain their claim for inclusion in the electoral roll and he refused to receive their applications.
The period prescribed for preferring claims and objections under Rule 43 was 30 days.
The final electoral roll was published on November 16 1978.
By that time the nominations had all been received.
The writ petition itself was filed on December 28 198 when the poll had to take place on December 31 1978.
We have therefore to proceed on the basis that it was only on December S 1978 for the first time that the attention of the Collector was drawn to the said error and that the writ petition itself was presented on December 28 1978.
