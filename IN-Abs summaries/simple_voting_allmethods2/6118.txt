Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India.
The petitioners are carpenters 1st and 2nd grade employed at the Wood Working Centre of the Himachal Pradesh State Handicrafts Corporation the Corpo ration.
In this petition under Article 32 of the Constitution they are seeking enforcement of their fundamental right to have equal pay for equal work.
They demand payment in terms paid to their counterparts in regular services.
They want the same pay of the regular employees as carpenters or in the alternative the minimum wages prescribed by the Deputy Commissioner for like categories of workmen.
The Government has not fixed the mini mum wages payable to the petitioners engaged in the Corpora tion or other like industries but the Corporation has adopted the minimum wages payable for similar work in the construction industry.
The Corporation has clearly stated that there are no regular employees of the petitioners  categories in its establishment and as such the question of payment to the petitioners the pay admissible to regular employees does not arise.
The main object of the Corporation as seen from the Memorandum of Associa tion is to preserve the traditional arts and crafts and also to popularise handicrafts and handloom items 665 in the State of Himachal Pradesh and other parts of the country and abroad.
Apart from giving training the Corporation also ensures marketing support to the artisans and craftsmen by purchasing their products at remunerative prices and sell them through the marketing network of the Corporation.
It is thus a service oriented organisation helping the village artisans and craftsmen to produce and market their products on remunerative prices.
It is said that the village artisans and craftsmen make different items on a piece rate basis and in some cases they execute the work in their own homes.
Nonetheless for the purpose of preserv ing and promoting traditional arts and crafts the Corpora tion has been kept alive.
PSS Petition dismissed.
