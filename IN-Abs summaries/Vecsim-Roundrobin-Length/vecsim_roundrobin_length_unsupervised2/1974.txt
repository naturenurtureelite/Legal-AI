Appeal No 68 of 1964.
AV Viswanatha Sastri and SP Varma for the respondent.
The quantum of this pension was calculated on the basis of 14th of the revenue of the Jagir.
 The learned counsel for the respondent Mr A Viswanatha Sastri urges that on its true interpretation the letter dated July 7 1837 showed an arrangement for sharing collections.
 It follows from the decisions of the Privy Council and the judgments of this Court cited above that if it is held in this case that the source of the allowance or pension is the arrangement arrived at in 1837.
Another passage from the speech of Viscount Simon is also relevant.
Appeal allowed.
