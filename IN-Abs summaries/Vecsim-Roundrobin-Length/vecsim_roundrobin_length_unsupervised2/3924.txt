 Criminal Appeal No 133 of 1975.
Appeal from the Judgment and order dated 3 2 1978 of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Crl.
365 The deceased Subhadramma was the wife of the appellant.
About three months before the occurrence the deceased gave birth to a female child in the house of the accused at Cherlopalle.
After the ninth day the mother and child according to customary practice were taken by the mother of the deceased to her house at Krishna Kalva.
After about one and a half months the accused asked his mother in law and brother in law to send his wife to his place.
After dinner all of them went to sleep.
Attracted by the cries raised by the PWs 1 to 3 the neighbourers P Ws 4 5 6 and others came there.
After holding the inquest the dead body was sent for postmortem examination.
After completing the investigation the Police laid a chargesheet against the accused and he was duly tried.
He regained consciousness next morning.
According to the accused the deceased received the injury when she placed herself between P W 1 and himself.
At the worst the so called improvement made by her may be rejected but no more.
At one time it was thou ht that an order of acquittal could be set aside for substantial and compelling reasons only and Courts used to launch on a search to discover those substantial and compelling reasons.
After Sanwat Singh vs State of Rajasthan this Court has consistently recognised the right of the Appellate Court to review the entire evidence and to come to its own conclusion bearing in mind the considerations mentioned by the Privy Council in Sheo Swarup s case.
But fanciful and remote possibilities must be left out of account.
