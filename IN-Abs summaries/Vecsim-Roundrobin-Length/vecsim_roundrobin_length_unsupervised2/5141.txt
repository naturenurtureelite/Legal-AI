Civil Appeal Nos3677 3680 of 1986 Etc.
From the Judgment and Order dated 1031986 of the Karnataka High Court in WP Nos.
4053 to 4056 of 1985.
By section 24 of Amending Act 47 of 1978 a proviso to section 637 was introduced.
By the time the proviso came into force 36 permits had been granted by the Karnataka State Transport Authority and 14 remained to be granted.
The Tribunal by its order dated February 28 1985 set aside the grant of the two permits in favour of the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation set aside the grant of three out of eleven permits to the Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation and instead granted three permits to private operators and increased the number of permits granted to the Indian Tourism Development Corporation from one to three.
A large number of applicants filed writ petitions in the High Court.
637 the preference became operative only if other things were equal.
A public service vehicle is defined in section 225 as any motor vehicle used or adapted to be used for the carriage of passengers for hire or reward and includes a motor cab contract carriage and stage carriage.
A motor car is defined in section 216 as any motor vehicle other than a transport vehicle 1013 omni bus road roller tractor motor cycle or invalid carriage.
Chapter IV A relates to special provisions relating to State Transport Under takings.
Desai J speaking for the court observed However when an application for a permit is made under Chapter IV the Undertaking has to compete with private operators who may as well make an application for permit.
47 the application of the Undertaking for an inter State route shall be examined as application of any other private operator.
 What has been said by the Court with reference to the preference 1017 provided for in section 471 H applies with equal force to the preference provided for by the proviso to section 637.
A question was raised before us about the vires of the fourth clause of the proviso to section 637.
Clauses i to iii of the proviso providing for preference to be given to applications for permits from the Indian Tourism Development Corporation the State Tourism Development Corporation and the State Tourist Department were not questioned but the preference provided for by clause iv and to be given to such operators of tourist cars or such travel agents as may be approved in this behalf by the Ministry dealing in tourism was questioned as an infringement of article 14 of the Constitution.
It is difficult to agree with these submissions.
