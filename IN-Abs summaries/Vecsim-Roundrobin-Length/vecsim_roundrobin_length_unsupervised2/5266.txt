 It was stated that the Finance and Tourism Department had agreed to the proposal to lease the properties to the ITDC and the Taj Group respectively.
 The Committee also referred to a proposal to establish a Subsidiary Zoo  some slight distance from Calcutta City and the request said to have been made for the allotment of 200 acres of land for that purpose.
In the meanwhile WEBCON a West Bengal Government Consultancy Undertaking was asked to examine the proposals and to advise the Government.
 The Minister for Metropolitan Development submitted a note to the Chief Minister on the resolution of the Managing Committee of the Zoo.
 On June 29 1981 the Director of the Zoo wrote to the Secretary of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services Department stating his objections to the Proposal to lease the land for construction of a hotel.
As per clause 11 of the Alipore Zoological Garden Management Rules 1957 the disposal of properties and funds are vested in the Managing Committee of he Garden.
 Presumably as a consequence of the letter from the Director of the Zoo there was a note by the Secretary Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services Department suggest ing the postponement of the implementation of the Cabinet decision till the necessary facilities then available at Begumbari land were shifted to other land of the same extent within a reasonable distance from the Zoological Garden as 249 these facilities were originally linked with the Zoo.
 It is to be noted here that though the stipulation was that the cost of new construction was to be initially met by Taj Group of Hotels and later to be adjusted against the rent payable by Taj Group the Taj Group later agreed to waive such reimbursement.
 The Act was made applicable to the public parks and gardens mentioned in the schedule.
