AS Nambiar and KR Nambiar for the Appellant.
He took charge of the office on 6101975 and had been residing in a house opposite the training school.
On 21101975 the appellant is stated to have pressed the demand to PW 1.
As instructed PW 1 was ready with ten rupees currency notes.
The appellant produced the currency notes.
Finally the appellant was chargesheeted.
At the trial the prosecution witnesses supported the case.
Before the High Court the contentions of the appellant were that there was no independent evidence regarding the demand the messenger who had contacted PW 1 at the 337 behest of the appellant had not been examined the solitary evidence of PW 1 is insufficient the explanation offered by the appellant was probable and there is no conclusive evi dence to hold that the appellant.
It took the view that the evidence of PW 1 find corroboration in the testimony of PW 2 and 6 and the contemporary records.
It cannot therefore be said that there had been consistent explanation for the appellant.
He had thereafter received the amount of Rs 100 from PW 1.
A fact is said to be proved when its existence is directly established or when upon the material before it the Court finds its existence to be so probable that a reasonable man would act on the supposition that it exists.
It is accordingly dismissed.
NVK Appeal dismissed.
