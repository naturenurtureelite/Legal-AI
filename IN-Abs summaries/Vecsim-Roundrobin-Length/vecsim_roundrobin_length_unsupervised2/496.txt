December 3.
Five persons including the three appellants were prosecuted for the murder of one Ram chander Shelke.
All five convicts then applied to the High Court for leave to appeal.
Anyway Rasika Bai heard shouts from that direction so she ran to the river bank with Subhana and they both say that they saw all five accused attacking Ramchander with axes and sticks.
But what the learned counsel for the appellants says is that he saw Narsabai on the evening of the murder and as she did not give him any names it is evident that no one knew who the assailants were and that therefore the accusation made against the accused was a subsequent concoction and that it was for that reason that they waited till the next morning before reporting the matter to the police.
Accordingly there must have been a prior meeting of minds.
At bottom it is a question of fact in every case and however similar the circumstances facts in one case cannot be used as a precedent to determine the conclusion on the facts in another.
