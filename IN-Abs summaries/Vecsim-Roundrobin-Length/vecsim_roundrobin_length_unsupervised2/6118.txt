Civil No 548 of 1987.
Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India.
In this petition under Article 32 of the Constitution they are seeking enforcement of their fundamental right to have equal pay for equal work.
A little more information about the purpose and object of the Corporation would be useful for proper understanding of the case.
In order to achieve this primary objec tive the Corporation gives training to artisans weavers and craftsmen in various traditional arts and crafts.
During the period of training the trainees are paid a stipend by the Corporation.
Apart from giving training the Corporation also ensures marketing support to the artisans and craftsmen by purchasing their products at remunerative prices and sell them through the marketing network of the Corporation.
But to avoid or minimise further loss it is stated that the Corporation has reduced its overheads and maintained only the administrative staff in the production centers at different parts of the State and no permanent craftsmen are employed.
He claimed equal salary for equal work at that of other drivers.
Apart from that the Court has expressly observed that the higher pay scale to avoid stagnation or resultant frustration for lack of promotional avenues may also be allowed.
He claimed pay scale admissible to Senior Speech Pathologist Senior Physiotherapist Senior Occupational Therapist Audiologist and Speech Pathologist.
But the Court held that the principle of equal pay for equal work cannot be invoked invariably in every kind of service particularly in the area of professional services.
From the averments in the pleadings of the parties it will be clear that the Corporation has no regularly employed carpenters.
Evidently the petitioners are claiming wages payable to the carpenters in Government service.
