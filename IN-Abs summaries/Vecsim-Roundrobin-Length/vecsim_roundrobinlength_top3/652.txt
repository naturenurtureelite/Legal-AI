Shortly stated the Act Rules and the Bye laws framed thereunder have a long term target of providing a net work of markets wherein facilities for correct weigbment are ensured storage accommodation is provided and equal powers of bargaining ensured so that the growers may bring their commercial crops to the market and sell them at reasonable prices.
It is also said that when a market is established no licence to purchase or sell commercial crops will be granted or renewed in respect of any place situated within such distance from the market as may from time to time be fixed by the State Government and that nothing under the Act prevents the Government from fixing a long distance as a prohibited area with the result that a person who is having a licence to trade in and about the place where the market is fixed is deprived of his livelihood which is an unreasonable restriction upon his right to do business.
It is unnecessary to express an opinion on the question whether the right of the appellants falls under article 191f or g of the Constitution of India or under both the sub clauses for the 1  3  2 IL R 4 ILR 1955 mad.
If on the other hand mahimai  is a trade allowance the said part of the 109 bye law will be superfluous as the allowance falls within the terms of the section itself This leads us to the question whether  mahimai  is a trade allowance within the meaning of section 14 of the Act.
