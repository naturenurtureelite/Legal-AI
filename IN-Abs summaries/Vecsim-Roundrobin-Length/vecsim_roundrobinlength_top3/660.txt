He was not present when the will was written.
He has spoken to the instructions received by him from Lakshmamma a year before the date of the execution of the will and he has stated that he prepared a draft at Mysore a day before the will was executed and that the will was written by the scribe as he dictated the contents from the said draft.
Even so their Lordships expressly added that in coming to the conclusion which they had done they must not be understood as throwing the slightest doubt on the principles laid down in Fulton vs Andrew 1 and other similar cases referred to in the argument.

Even so the High Court has expressed its conclusions in favour of res pondent I on the question about the character of the subsequent acquisitions of items 3 4 and 5 and about the subsisting title of the testatrix in respect of all the properties covered by the will.
