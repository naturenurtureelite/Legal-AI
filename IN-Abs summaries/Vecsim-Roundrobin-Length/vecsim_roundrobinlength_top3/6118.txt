Apart from that the Court has expressly observed that the higher pay scale to avoid stagnation or resultant frustration for lack of promotional avenues may also be allowed.
He claimed pay scale admissible to Senior Speech Pathologist Senior Physiotherapist Senior Occupational Therapist Audiologist and Speech Pathologist.
His case was based on the allegations that he was discharging same duties and performing similar functions as Senior Speech Therapist Senior Physiotherapist Senior Occupa tional Therapist Audiologist and Speech Pathologist.
But the Court held that the principle of equal pay for equal work cannot be invoked invariably in every kind of service particularly in the area of professional services.
If the classification has reasonable nexus with the objective sought to be achieved efficiency in the administration the State would be justified in prescribing different pay scales.
But it follows naturally that equal pay for unequal work will be a negation of that right Thus the law relating to equal pay for equal work has been practically hammered out and very little remains for further innovation.
From the averments in the pleadings of the parties it will be clear that the Corporation has no regularly employed carpenters.
In the first place even assum ing that the petitioners  jobs are comparable with the counterparts in the government service the petitioners cannot enforce the right to equal pay for equal work.
A comparison cannot be made with counterparts in other establishments with different management or even in establishments in different geographical locations though owned by the same master.
By the general description of their job one cannot come to the conclusion that every carpenter or craftsmen is equal to the other in the performance of his work.
As to the claim for regularisation of services of the peti tioners 669 we express no opinion since the factual data is disputed and is insufficient.
In the result the petition fails and is dismissed.
