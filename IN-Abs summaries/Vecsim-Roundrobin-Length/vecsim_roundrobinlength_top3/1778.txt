March 24 1964.
That in brief is the substance of the argument raised by the appellant.
In dealing with the question of construing the unamended definition of the term wages it is essential to bear in mind the scope and character of the powers conferred on Industrial Tribunals when they deal with industrial disputes under the provisions of the Indus trial Disputes Act.
If it is shown to the satisfaction of Industrial adjudication that the terms of contract of employment 422 for instance need to be revised in the interests of social justice it is at liberty to consider the matter take into account all relevant factors and if a change or revision of the terms appears to be justified it can and often enough it does radically change the terms of the contract of employment.
In our opinion the Bombay view correctly represents the true legal position in the matter.
There would be no order as to costs.
