AS Nambiar and KR Nambiar for the Appellant.
PW 3 the Principal of the training school issued exhibit P 2 show cause notice to the PW 1 Venkataswamy the canteen contractor as to why his licence for running the canteen should not be cancelled.
The latter made a complaint to PW 6 who thereupon arranged a trap.
The appellant produced the currency notes.
Finally the appellant was chargesheeted.
At the trial the prosecution witnesses supported the case.
PW 1 affirmed the fact that the appellant made the demand and had also received the amount on 2210.
It was also urged that the appellant being new in the office could exert little influence on the Principal and the whole story is therefore improbable.
The High Court thought that though the conviction under section 161 IPC and section 52 of the Prevention of Corruption Act is to be maintained no separate sentence need be award ed under section 161 IPC.
It cannot therefore be said that there had been consistent explanation for the appellant.
PW 3 the Principal has averred in unequivocal terms that Ex.
P 2 memo had been issued on the basis of the complaint received from the appellant that on getting the explanation from PW 1 he on 18101975 itself passed orders and closed the file.
Of course it is open to that person to show that though that money was not due to him as legal remuneration it was legally due to him in some other manner or that he had received it under a transaction or an arrangement which was lawful.
A fact is said to be proved when its existence is directly established or when upon the material before it the Court finds its existence to be so probable that a reasonable man would act on the supposition that it exists.
 On a careful consideration of the facts and circum stances we are not satisfied that the appellant had even by preponderance of probability succeeded in rebutting the presumption.
NVK Appeal dismissed.
