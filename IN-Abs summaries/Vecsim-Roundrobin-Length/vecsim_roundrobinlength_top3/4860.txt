781 VS Desai Mrs J Wad and Miss Aruna Mathur for the Appellants.
After hearing the learned counsel for the parties we allowed the appeal of Prakash accused 5 and acquitted him and set aside his conviction and the sentence awarded to him.
Accused 5 and 6 only have filed Criminal Appeal 288 of 1980 and Criminal Appeal 287 of 1980 respectively against the conviction of accused 5 and the sentence of imprisonment for life awarded by the High Court under section 302 read with section 120B IPC and the confirmation of the conviction and sentence awarded to accused 6 by the trial court under section 302 read with section 34 IPC respectively.
But the High Court accepted the evidence of the approver PW 1 against accused 6 as reliable and the judicial confession Exh 138 of accused 6 as being voluntary and reliable and both corroborated by other evidence and it acted also upon the retracted judicial confession of accused 5 in holding that the guilt of accused 6 for the murder of Malan had been proved beyond all reasonable doubt.
