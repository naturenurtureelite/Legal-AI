Appeals from the judgment and decree dated July 31 1964 of the Calcutta High Court in Appeal from Original Decree No 613 of 1962.
DN Mukherjee for the respondent in CA No 931 of 1965 and the appellant in CA No 1149 of 1965.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Sarkar CJ.
Sudhir is admittedly a member of a Scheduled Caste.
In his petition Sudhir had further claimed that he should be declared elected in the place of the appellant if the latter s election was found to be invalid.
He challenges the validity of the order of the High Court setting aside his election.
In the election petition the respondent had stated that the appellant was a member of the Saha caste and not a member of any Schedule Caste.
389 that the appellant was a Sunri by caste but was excluded from the Scheduled Caste group because he belonged to a smaller caste group of Sunirs known as Sahas.
He held that the Sahas formed a group within the Sunri caste be it a sub caste strictly so called or other 390 wise.
It is natural to think that if the excluded Sahas were those Sunris who bore the surname Saha the Order would have made that clear.
