Appeal No 1713NT of 1973.
From the.
Not present  The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SABYASACHI MUKHARJI J.
A similar letter was written by Ved Prakesh thanking the assessee his father for the gift of Rs25000 made to him and Rs50000 gifted to his son.
But it appears that it was admitted position that Tika Ram  Sons had a cash balance of Rs4000 only on 111957 and it did not have any overdraft facilities with any bank.
34 and 5 were answered in the negative.
Aggrieved by the said decision the revenue has come up in appeal.
But in the cases of non banking companies or firms if these companies or firms do not have overdraft facilities it is not possible to make valid gift if sums or funds are not available.
But in such cases 127 merely books entries would not suffice.
Before the Bombay High Court in the case of Chimanbhai Lalbhai vs Commissioner of Income Tax Contral Bombay there were entries in the books of a Banking Company and gifts were held to be valid.
Cash Balance was only Rs7626.
But the Allahabad High Court in the case of Gopal Raj Swarup vs Commissioner of Wealth Tax Lucknow supra had to deal with the wealth tax.
