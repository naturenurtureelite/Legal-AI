Appeals from the judgment and decree dated May 2 1960 of the Rajasthan High Court in Civil Second Appeal Nos.

March 12 1964.
By May 15 1949 the United State of Rajasthan was formed including the Matsya Union into which the former State of Dholpur had merged on March 17 1948.
Before we refer to the decisions of the courts below with regard to this controversy it would be convenient to clear the ground by indicating the admitted position which resulted in the inclusion of the former Dholpur State into the Part B State of Rajasthan which came into existence on January 26 1950 and which would be bound by article 2952 of the Constitution.
 The three learned Judges who heard the reference were unanimously of the opinion that the expression Government of the corresponding State used in article 2952 of the Constitution with reference to Rajasthan meant not only the Government of the United State of Rajasthan but also the United State of Rajasthan including its component units.
180 all laws in all Covenanting States were repealed and the laws in force in the State of Patiala were to apply mutatis mutandis to the entire territories of the new State.
But whereas in the present case the old laws were to continue till they were repealed or altered it follows in our opinion that the rights arising under the old laws in the subjects of the merging States would continue and these subjects would have the same rights against the new State as they would have under the old laws against the merging State.
182 new State intended to affirm the rights of the subjects which they had against the merging State and to assume itself the liability if any arising against the merging State.
