Civil Appeal No 159 of 1974.
488 N N Goswamy and Arvind Minocha for the appellant.
Kapil Sibbal and D Probir Mitra for respondents.
In appeal by the defendant the decree was reversed.
Against that decree an appeal was preferred by the appellant to the High Court.
No application was made by the appellant to bring on record his legal representatives within the period prescribed.
An application was made on 1 2 1971 by the appellant stating that Som Dass died on 26 11 1970 leaving behind him Shiam Dass as his Chela and for impleading him.
 489 We do not think that the view of the High Court was correct.
 This rule is based on the principle that trial of a suit cannot be brought to an end merely because the interest of a party in the subject matter of the suit has devolved upon another during the pendency of the suit but that suit may be continued against the person acquiring the interest with the leave of the Court.
