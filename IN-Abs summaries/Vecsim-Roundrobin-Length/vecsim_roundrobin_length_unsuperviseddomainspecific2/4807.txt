Civil Appeal No 1433 of 1977 Appeal by Special leave from the Judgment and Order dated the 16th February 1977 of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Civil Writ Petition No 752 of 1977.
Harbans Lal IS Goel  RN Poddar for the Respondent.
He was confirmed in that post in course of time.
Acting in pursuance of the provision of section 144 of the Amending Act the Government of Haryana notified the absorption of the appellant as a clerk though as stated earlier he was working as a head Clerk in the Loharu Panchayat Samiti.
Being aggrieved by his absorption on a lower post he filed a writ petition in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana asking that he should be absorbed as a Head Clerk.
But as a result of the deletion of section 33 of the Act by the Amending Act of 1973 the Panchayat Samiti lost its power to make appointments to the Panchayat.
737 It is urged by Shri Jain who appears on behalf of the appellant that by reason of section 144 of the Amending Act the appellant was entitled to continue in the service of the Panchayat on the same terms and conditions on which he was employed by the Panchayat Samiti until he was absorbed in Government service.
For these reasons the appeal fails and is dismissed.
SR Appeal dismissed.
