 When this matter was pending consideration the Government appointed the Pay Commission 1971 72 headed by Shri Ali Zahir.
 It will be seen that the Pay Commission refused to equate Bench Secretaries with Section Officers in view of their differential duties.
2 It should be appropriate for the Bench Secre taries to accept 10 promotional posts in the pay scale of Rs500 1000 as recommended by the Pay Commission.
 The Anomalies Committee also thus rejected the claim of Bench Secretaries for placing them at par with Section Officers.
 In support of these conclusions the High Court relied upon two decisions of this Court i Randhir Singh vs Union of India  and ii P Savita vs Union of India 1985 Suppl 1 SCR 101.
All Bench Secretaries in the High Court of Allahabad are undisputedly having same duties.
 In Randhir Singh the petitioner was a driver constable in the Delhi Police Force under the Delhi Administration.
