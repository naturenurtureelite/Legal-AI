On appeal from the judgment and order dated the 978 13th April 1954 of the Bombay High Court in Appeal No 49 of 1954 arising out of the order dated the 31st day of March 1954 of the said High Court exercising its Ordinary Original Jurisdiction in Misc.
Petition No 55 of 1954.
K T Desai P N Bhagwati Rameshwar Nath and Rajinder Narain for the appellants.

November 10.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMA AYYAR J.
Messrs Abdul Karim and Brothers owned along with certain other properties which are not the subject matter of the present appeal three mills with bungalows and chawls at Ambernath in Thana District and the Bobbin Factory at Tardeo in Bombay.
Secondly there was a sale of the stock of raw materials unsold finished goods spare parts cars trucks and other movables which were in the mills and the factory with elaborate provisions for the determination and payment of the price therefor in 979 due course.
And thirdly there was an agreement to sell the mills and the factory to the appellants in certain events and subject to certain conditions.
There was also a clause for referring the disputes between the parties to arbitration.
On 12 2 1954 the respondent issued a notice to the appellants Exhibit C wherein be set out that the appellants had systematically committed breaches of the various terms on which the properties bad been leased to them and called upon them to show cause why the lease should not be cancelled and why they should not be evicted.
On the second question he held that section 10 applied only to properties of the evacuee and that the movables in respect of which directions were given ceased to be the property of the evacuee by reason of the sale in favour of the appellants and that in consequence the directions with reference to them were unauthorised.
By their judgment dated 13 4 1954 they held that on the plain language of section 12 it would apply whenever there was a lease and that lease was in respect of property belonging to the evacuee that there was no warrant for imposing a further limitation on that section that that lease should also have been granted by the evacuee and that accordingly the Custodian had power to issue the notice Exhibit C for cancelling the lease.
Against this judgment the appellants have preferred this appeal on a certificate granted by the High Court under article 1331 b and the only point that arises for determination therein is as to whether the Custodian has the power under section 12 to 981 cancel a lease granted by himself and not by the evacuee.
Section 5 of the Administration of Evacuee Property Amendment Act 1954 XLII of 1954 enacts the following Explanation to section 12 of Act XXXI of 1950 In this sub section lease  includes a lease granted by the Custodian and agreement  includes an agreement entered into by the Custodian.
But he con tends that this power could be exercised only so as to override a bar imposed by any law but not the contract under which the lease is held and this result flows according to him from the language of the non obstante clause which is limited to anything contained in any other law for the time being in force and does not include or any contract between the parties.
In their petition under article 226 it was the validity of the notice.
