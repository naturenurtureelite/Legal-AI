any other law for the time being in force.
Acting in pursuance of the provision of section 144 of the Amending Act the Government of Haryana notified the absorption of the appellant as a clerk though as stated earlier he was working as a head Clerk in the Loharu Panchayat Samiti.
But as a result of the deletion of section 33 of the Act by the Amending Act of 1973 the Panchayat Samiti lost its power to make appointments to the Panchayat.
737 It is urged by Shri Jain who appears on behalf of the appellant that by reason of section 144 of the Amending Act the appellant was entitled to continue in the service of the Panchayat on the same terms and conditions on which he was employed by the Panchayat Samiti until he was absorbed in Government service.
Clearly it had fortified that right on June 13 1973.
For these reasons the appeal fails and is dismissed.
