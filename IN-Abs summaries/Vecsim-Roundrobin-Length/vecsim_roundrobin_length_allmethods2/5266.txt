 It was stated that the Finance and Tourism Department had agreed to the proposal to lease the properties to the ITDC and the Taj Group respectively.
 The Committee also referred to a proposal to establish a Subsidiary Zoo  some slight distance from Calcutta City and the request said to have been made for the allotment of 200 acres of land for that purpose.
In the meanwhile WEBCON a West Bengal Government Consultancy Undertaking was asked to examine the proposals and to advise the Government.
I agree.
 On June 29 1981 the Director of the Zoo wrote to the Secretary of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services Department stating his objections to the Proposal to lease the land for construction of a hotel.
 Presumably as a consequence of the letter from the Director of the Zoo there was a note by the Secretary Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services Department suggest ing the postponement of the implementation of the Cabinet decision till the necessary facilities then available at Begumbari land were shifted to other land of the same extent within a reasonable distance from the Zoological Garden as 249 these facilities were originally linked with the Zoo.
 It is to be noted here that though the stipulation was that the cost of new construction was to be initially met by Taj Group of Hotels and later to be adjusted against the rent payable by Taj Group the Taj Group later agreed to waive such reimbursement.
Thereafter an expert Committee was consti tuted to supervise the construction Of alternative facili ties.
 The Act was made applicable to the public parks and gardens mentioned in the schedule.
 Section 4 enables the Government to make rules for the management and preservation of any park and for regulating the use thereof by the public.
 I wish to delineate the parameters of public interest litigation concisely against the background of the facts of this case so that this salutory type of litigation does not lose its credibility.
