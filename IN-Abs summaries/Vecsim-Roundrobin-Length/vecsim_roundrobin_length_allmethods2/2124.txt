Appeals from the judgment and decree dated July 31 1964 of the Calcutta High Court in Appeal from Original Decree No 613 of 1962.
Abhoy Pada described himself in the nomination paper as a member of the Sunri caste which is a Scheduled Caste.
At the hearing of the petition by the Election Tribunal however he challenged the election only on the ground that Abhoy Pada was a member of the Saha caste and not a member of a Scheduled Caste.
Appeal No 931 of 1965 is by Abhoy Pada.
389 that the appellant was a Sunri by caste but was excluded from the Scheduled Caste group because he belonged to a smaller caste group of Sunirs known as Sahas.
After all the evidence led in a case may be imperfect.
Appeal No 931 of 1965 allowed.
Appeal No 1149 of 1965 dismissed.
