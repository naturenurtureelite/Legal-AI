Civil No 548 of 1987.
Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India.
In this petition under Article 32 of the Constitution they are seeking enforcement of their fundamental right to have equal pay for equal work.
A little more information about the purpose and object of the Corporation would be useful for proper understanding of the case.
During the period of training the trainees are paid a stipend by the Corporation.
Apart from giving training the Corporation also ensures marketing support to the artisans and craftsmen by purchasing their products at remunerative prices and sell them through the marketing network of the Corporation.
But to avoid or minimise further loss it is stated that the Corporation has reduced its overheads and maintained only the administrative staff in the production centers at different parts of the State and no permanent craftsmen are employed.
Article 14 permits reasonable classification rounded on rational basis.
Apart from that the Court has expressly observed that the higher pay scale to avoid stagnation or resultant frustration for lack of promotional avenues may also be allowed.
But the Court held that the principle of equal pay for equal work cannot be invoked invariably in every kind of service particularly in the area of professional services.
But it follows naturally that equal pay for unequal work will be a negation of that right Thus the law relating to equal pay for equal work has been practically hammered out and very little remains for further innovation.
A comparison cannot be made with counterparts in other establishments with different management or even in establishments in different geographical locations though owned by the same master.
As to the claim for regularisation of services of the peti tioners 669 we express no opinion since the factual data is disputed and is insufficient.
In the result the petition fails and is dismissed.
