Appeal No 251 of 1963.
Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated March 20 1957 of the Patna High Court in Civil Revision No 40 of 1956.
 10  per day and that led to the present claim made by the respondents under section 15 of the Act.
421 The authority has found that section 2vi includes wages prescribed by the Industrial Tribunal and so it has rejected the appellants  contention that the applications made by the respondents were incompetent under section 15 of the Act.
If it is shown to the satisfaction of Industrial adjudication that the terms of contract of employment 422 for instance need to be revised in the interests of social justice it is at liberty to consider the matter take into account all relevant factors and if a change or revision of the terms appears to be justified it can and often enough it does radically change the terms of the contract of employment.
423 Chatterjee and Sons vs Chandreswar Singh1 the Calcutta High Court appears to have taken the view which supports Mr Setalvad s argument whereas in the Modern Mills Ltd vs V R Mangalvedhkar2 and in V B Godse Manager Prabha Mills Ltd vs R M Naick Inspector under the Payment of Wages Act3 the Bombay High Court has interpreted section 2vi to include wages directed to be paid by industrial adjudication.
Appeal dismissed 1 AIR 1951 Cal 29.
2 AIR 1930 Bom.
