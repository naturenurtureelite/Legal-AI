Appeal No 1375 of 1966.
Appeal from the judgment and order dated October 22 1965 of the Bombay High Court Nagpur Bench in Special Civil Application No 355 of 1964.
B R Agarwala and section B Nerkar for respondent No 1.
A K Sen A section Bobde G L Sanghi and O C Mathur for respondent No 2.
Every panchayat before deciding to levy a tax or fee shall observe the following procedure namely a The Panchayat shall by resolution passed at its meeting select a tax or fee which it proposes to levy and in such resolution shall specify the rate at which it is to be levied.
Fixing of octroi limits and nakas.
A Panchayat shall with the approval of the Collector or of any officer authorised by the Collector not below the rank of Mamlatdar Tehsildar Naib Tehsildar or Mahalkari fix octroi limits and the number and location of octroi Nakas within 219 the limits of its jurisdiction.
 Rules 30 31 32 and 33 deal with refund of octroi.
But the learned counsel for the Company Mr Ashok Sen argues that this interpretation is not correct because para 2 of r4 says that the tax shall accordingly be levied from the date which shall be specified in the notice and he says that if the octroi limits had not been approved of by the time the resolution is passed how could the tax be levied from the date specified in the notice.
Apart from the fact that it may in certain circumstances lead to illegal levies there is nothing in the language of r21 which indicates that the Collector can regularise an imposition made without the authority of law.
5 of section 124 and this opening sentence would cover all II appeals under sub section.
5 of section 124 but in the context and setting the heading of r 5 brings out the scope of the rule.
Accordingly.
