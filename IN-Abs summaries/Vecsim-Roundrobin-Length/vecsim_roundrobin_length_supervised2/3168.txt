F section Nariman Additional Solicitor General of India and A V Rangam for the appellants.
After referring to the decisions in Gibson vs Barlon2 Edmonds vs Foster3 and Park vs Lawton4 where it was held that a person charged with an offence could not rely on his own default as an answer to the charge and so if the person charged was responsible for not calling the general meeting he cannot be heard to say in defence to the charge that the general meeting had not been called and that the company and its officers were bound to perform the condition precedent if they could do that in order that they might perform their duty this Court considered that as the correct view to take.

 In this state of difference of opinion among the various High Courts and the absence of a decision of this Court on section 134 this appeal has been filed.
supra that a company or its directors in a prosecution under section 32 and section 133 of the 1913 Act could not in defence to such prosecution rely upon their own 415 failure to call the general body meeting applies with equal force to a prosecution under section 134 of the Act.
We say nothing about section 32 about which this Court has already laid down the law.
The appeal is dismissed.
