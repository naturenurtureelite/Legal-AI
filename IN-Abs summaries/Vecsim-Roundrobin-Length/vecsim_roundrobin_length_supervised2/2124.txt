DN Mukherjee for the respondent in CA No 931 of 1965 and the appellant in CA No 1149 of 1965.
Sudhir is admittedly a member of a Scheduled Caste.
Abhoy Pada described himself in the nomination paper as a member of the Sunri caste which is a Scheduled Caste.
At the hearing of the petition by the Election Tribunal however he challenged the election only on the ground that Abhoy Pada was a member of the Saha caste and not a member of a Scheduled Caste.
Appeal No 931 of 1965 is by Abhoy Pada.
Nobody disputes that.
If Sunri is a caste the word Saha  in the expression excluding Saha in the item must without more.
After all the evidence led in a case may be imperfect.
If the correct interpretation of item 40 was as we think it was that Sahas were a caste group within the Sunri caste no question of Sahas being a distinct class independent of Sunris could arise.
For the same reason we are unable to agree with the interpretation of the High Court that the Sahas excluded were those Sunris who bore the surname Saha.
One set of hearing fees only.
Appeal No 931 of 1965 allowed.
Appeal No 1149 of 1965 dismissed.
