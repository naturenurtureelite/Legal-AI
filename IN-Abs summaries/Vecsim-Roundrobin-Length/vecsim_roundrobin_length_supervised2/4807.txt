Civil Appeal No 1433 of 1977 Appeal by Special leave from the Judgment and Order dated the 16th February 1977 of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Civil Writ Petition No 752 of 1977.
JD Jain  Mrs Kawaljit Kocher for the Appellant.
On January 21 1974 he was promoted as a Head Clerk on an ad hoc basis.
On April 1 1975 the appellant was appointed as a Head Clerk.
A plain consequence of this deletion was that the Panchayat Samitis were divested of their power to make appointments to the Panchayats.
Being aggrieved by his absorption on a lower post he filed a writ petition in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana asking that he should be absorbed as a Head Clerk.
But as a result of the deletion of section 33 of the Act by the Amending Act of 1973 the Panchayat Samiti lost its power to make appointments to the Panchayat.
the Panchayat.
737 It is urged by Shri Jain who appears on behalf of the appellant that by reason of section 144 of the Amending Act the appellant was entitled to continue in the service of the Panchayat on the same terms and conditions on which he was employed by the Panchayat Samiti until he was absorbed in Government service.
It could not therefore have appointed the appellant as a Head Clerk as it purported to do in January 1974 on an ad hoc basis or in April 1975 on a regular basis.
For these reasons the appeal fails and is dismissed.
SR Appeal dismissed.
