No 7338 of 1981.
Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India.
G Ramaswamy Additional Solicitor General RP Srivastava 634 and Miss A Subhashini for the Respondent.
He was pro moted as officiating Assistant Engineer in class II service with effect from  255.
1954 and came to be confirmed as Section Officer by an order dated 8101955.
Union of India vs KR Tahiliani and Anr 1980 1 SLR 847.
According to the said judgment FR 56 ji has no application to officiating government servants hence can have no appli cation to the petitioner since the petitioner was an officiating government servant.
 The impugned notice ran thus No 3245266 EC.
111 Government of India Central Public Works Department New Delhi the 3876 635 ORDER WHEREAS the Engineer in Chief is of opinion that it is in public interest to do so NOW THEREFORE in exercise of the powers conferred by clause j of Rule 56 of the Fundamental Rules the Engineer in Chief hereby gives notice to Shri AL Ahuja As sistant Engineer Civil at present under suspension that he having already attained the age of fifty years on 1021972 shall retire from service with effect from the forenoon of 3rd November 1976 or from the date of expiry of three months computed from the date of issue of the service of this notice on him whichever is latter.
 It is clear from it that the petitioner attained the age of 50 years on 1021972 and therefore on the date of the order he had completed the age of 54 years.
Admittedly he was holding a class II post when the impugned order was served on him.
As already indicated above he had crossed the age of 50 years but had not attained the age of 55 years by the date of the impugned order.
Even viewed closely and meticulously the structure of the clause namely if he is in Class I or Class II 637 service or post emphasises the nature of the service or post vis a vis the Government servant concerned.
But if he is only a temporary hand he has no right to the post and can always be reverted to the post if any on which he has a lien.
But the correct ness thereof is disputed by learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for the Union of India and that is why this writ petition was directed to be heard by a larger Bench.
Even if the writ petition is allowed and the order of compulsory retirement is set aside the petitioner cannot go back to service.
But he would be entitled to pecuniary benefit of salary and allowances admissible under the rules.
Accordingly we allow thewrit petition and direct the respondent to pay to the petitioner the salary and other allowances which would have been payable for the period between 511.
1976 and 292.
6251  8189 OF 1981 Each of the petitioners in these two writ applications under Article 32 of the Constitution was employed in the Central Public Works Department in the Ministry of Works and Housing of Government of India and has been compulsorily retired under Fundamental Rule 56j.
By now both the petitioners would have retired from service and therefore they cannot be resorted in service.
HLC Petition allowed.
