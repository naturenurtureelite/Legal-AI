Before we deal with the above points we may give a few facts.
921 As observed by Gajendragadkar J as he then was in Union of lndia vs H C Goel1 the enquiry report along with the evidence recorded constitute the material on which the Government has ultimately to act.
As is well known the State of Bombay was reorganised into the above two States and the Bombay Reorganisation Act 1960 contained various provisions for the apportionment of assets and liabilities between the two States.
2 For the purposes of this section there shall be deemed to be included in the liabilities which have accrued or may accrue under any contract aany liability to satisfy an order or award made by any court or other tribunal in proceedings relating to the contract and b any liability in respect of expenses incurred in or in connection with any such proceedings.
3This section shall have effect subject to the other provisions of this Part relating to the apportionment of liabilities in respect of loans guarantees and other financial obligations and bank balances and securities shall notwithstanding that they partake of the nature of contractual rights be dealt with under those provisions.
 Even Lord Goddard CJ in Terrell vs Secretary of State for the Colonies3 observed that the case Reilly vs R 2 shows that there may be contractual rights existing before determination of a contract at will which are not inconsistent with a power to determine and he stuck to this in Hambrook s case1 by stating  Although it is clear that no action for wrongful dismissal can be brought by a discharged civil servant I may be allowed to say that I adhere to the opinion which I expressed in Terrell vs Secretary of State for the Colonies1 that he could recover his salary for the time during which he has served.
