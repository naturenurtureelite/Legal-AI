G B Pai Manick K Gagrat J B Dadachanji O C Mathur and K J John for the Appellants in CA No 2299 and Respondents in CA 230079.
170 The Union filed a statement before the Tribunal claiming an upward revision of the wage scales and dearness allowance and an increase from fifteen years to twenty years in the span for earning annual increments.
House rent allowance was also paid.
171 in this connection it proceeded on the footing that the appellant was a separate and independent division of Tata Sons Limited and had no functional integrality with the other divisions.

173 Two days after the award was made an application was made by the Union stating In the said award your Honour has observed at the end of para 22 In view of the increase that is being allowed in the basic pay I do not propose to revise the existing scheme of Dearness Allowance.
However this is not clearly mentioned anywhere in the award due to accidental slip or omission.
I do not think that any problem would arise for interpretation of the award.
Considering the appeal of Tata Consulting Engineers first the contention of learned counsel for the appellant is that having regard to the financial capacity of the appellant the Tribunal erred in making the wage scales retrospective and in any event in ranging the retrospectivity back to 1st January 1976.
Rule 31 provides 31.
And that is confirmed by what was stated in paragraph 23 of the award Considering this outgoing the flat increase of Rs 150 in the category of Draughtsman and Rs 100 in the case of the other categories would be fair.
Even when considering the range of permissible retrospectivity the Tribunal stated in the award In view of the revision of the wage scales there would be consequent increase in the dearness allowance and the house rent allowance.
Again if the flat increase is Rs 65 per month to the individual workmen of all categories the additional load would total Rs 497772 .
Finally on the basis that the individual Draughtsman would be given an increase of Rs 75 per month and the individual workmen of other categories Rs 50 per month the additional load was calculated at Rs 463092 .
I shall now consider Civil Appeal No 2300 of 1979 filed by the workmen.
Having regard to the not inconsiderable improvement in the level of the basic wage it observed that there would be a consequent increase in the dearness allowance and house rent allowance.
If the dearness allowance is linked with the cost of living index the whole award will have to be reopened and the entire basis on which it has been made will have to be reconsidered.
Accordingly the appeal filed by the workmen must fail.
Civil Appeal No 2300 of 1979 is dismissed.
However we do not agree with our learned brother that Civil Appeal No 2299 of 1979 should be allowed in so far as it relates to the order dated December 22 1978 of the Industrial Tribunal which purports to correct the award dated December 20 1978.
In our opinion Civil Appeal No 2299 of 1979 should be dismissed in its entirety.
However this is not clearly mentioned anywhere in the award due to accidental slip or omission.
I do not think that any problem would arise for interpretation of the award.
Finally at the end of paragraph 21 the Tribunal said  In view of this position the Company can easily bear some burden that might fall as a result of the upward revision of the wage scales.
Fitment If as on 1st January 1976 an employee is drawing a salary less than the beginning of the respective grade he should be first stepped up to the beginning of the grade.
If the pay of an employee does not coincide with any step in the revised pay scale and falls between two steps in the reclassified pay scales the basic pay of that employee shall be fixed at the step higher in the revised scale.
After fixing the salary of the employees in the scales as above the employees should be given increments in the new scales as noted below i Employees who have completed 5 years or more as on 1st January 1976 3 increments.
iii All other employees with more than one year s service shall be given one increment.
SR Appeals dismissed.
