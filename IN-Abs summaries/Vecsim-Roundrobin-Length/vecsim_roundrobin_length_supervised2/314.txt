1303 Appeal by Special Leave granted by the Supreme Court by its Order dated the 31st July 1953 from the Judgment and Order dated the 15th May 1953 of the High Court of Judicature for the State of Pepsu at Th Patiala in Criminal Appeal No 140 of 1952 arising out of the Judgment and Order dated the 31st March 1952 of the Court of Magistrate 1st Class Patiala in Challan Case No 160102 of 1951.
Jai Gopal Sethi Naunit Lal with him for the appellant.
N section Bindra Porus A Mehta and P G Gokhale with him for the respondent.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMA AYYAR J.
1305 The position therefore is that the prosecution which has resulted in the conviction of the appellant was initiated without any sanction under section 1971 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and if sanction under that section is necessary as contended for by Mr Sethi then the entire proceedings including the conviction must be quashed.

4 1948 LR 75 IA 180 1308 ing to the office as to be inseparable from them then sanction under section 1971 would be necessary but if there was no necessary connection between them and the performance of those duties the official status furnishing only the occasion or opportunity for the acts then no sanction would be required.
We have therefore first to concentrate on the word offence .
Now an offence seldom consists of a single act.
1309 urged on behalf of the respondent.
In Hori Ram Singh vs Emperor1 the medicines had not been entered in the stock book and were removed by the accused to his residence and the charge against him was that in so removing them he had committed MISappropriation.
Reference may also be made to the following observations of Sulaiman J in the same case The question whether a criminal breach of trust can be committed while purporting to act in execution of his duty is not capable of being answered hypothetically in the abstract without any reference to the actual facts of the case.
An attempt to answer the question in a generalized way has been responsible for loose language used in some of the cases cited before us.
In Albert West Meads vs The King1 an Army Officer had received two sums of money and was subsequently unable to produce them.
He contended that the conviction was illegal for want of sanction but the Privy Council following H H B Gill vs The King1 rejected this contention.
3 1948 LR 75 IA 41.
If what appears on the face of the roll is true and whether it is true or not is not a matter relevant at the stage of sanction then the acts with which the appellant is charged fall within the scope of his duties and can be justified by him as done by virtue of his office.
Clearly therefore sanction was required under section 1971 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before the appellant could be prosecuted under section 409 and the absence of such sanc tion is fatal to the maintainability of the prosecution.
