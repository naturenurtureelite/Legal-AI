Civil Appeal No 159 of 1974.
488 N N Goswamy and Arvind Minocha for the appellant.
Against that decree an appeal was preferred by the appellant to the High Court.
When Som Dass died the interest which was the subject matter of the suit devolved upon Shiam Das as he was elected to be the Mahant of the Dera and the appeal could be continued under Q 22 r 10 of the Civil Procedure Code against the person upon whom the interest had devolved.
2 The attachment of a decree pending an appeal there from shall be deemed to be an interest entitling the person who procured such attachment to the benefit of sub rule 1.
 This rule is based on the principle that trial of a suit cannot be brought to an end merely because the interest of a party in the subject matter of the suit has devolved upon another during the pendency of the suit but that suit may be continued against the person acquiring the interest with the leave of the Court.
 We also see no reason why the High Court should not have granted leave to the appellant to prosecute the appeal.
