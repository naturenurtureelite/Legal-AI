Civil Appeal Nos3677 3680 of 1986 Etc.
From the Judgment and Order dated 1031986 of the Karnataka High Court in WP Nos.
4053 to 4056 of 1985.
By section 24 of Amending Act 47 of 1978 a proviso to section 637 was introduced.
By the time the proviso came into force 36 permits had been granted by the Karnataka State Transport Authority and 14 remained to be granted.
A number of appeals were preferred to the Karnataka State Transport Appellate Tribunal.
It was on that ground again it was so stated by the Tribunal that some of the appellants 1012 before the Tribunal had to be denied the grant of permits though otherwise they would have been entitled to the grant of permits having regard to their expertise experience and resources.
A large number of applicants filed writ petitions in the High Court.
637 the preference became operative only if other things were equal.
It was also urged that the fourth sub clause of the proviso offended article 14 and had to be struck down.
A motor car is defined in section 216 as any motor vehicle other than a transport vehicle 1013 omni bus road roller tractor motor cycle or invalid carriage.
It signifies that other things being equal 1016 one will have preference over the others.
47 the application of the Undertaking for an inter State route shall be examined as application of any other private operator.
Clauses i to iii of the proviso providing for preference to be given to applications for permits from the Indian Tourism Development Corporation the State Tourism Development Corporation and the State Tourist Department were not questioned but the preference provided for by clause iv and to be given to such operators of tourist cars or such travel agents as may be approved in this behalf by the Ministry dealing in tourism was questioned as an infringement of article 14 of the Constitution.
It was said that the clause contained sufficient guidelines for the exercise of discretion in granting approval by the Central Government.
It is difficult to agree with the interpretation of the Karnataka High Court having regard to the definitions of Transport Vehicle and motor car contained in section 229 A and section 216 respectively.
637 of the .
It is seen that the scheme excludes omnibus operators and requires applicants to have 1019 either two years  experience in the car hire business with contacts in the tourist business or to own five tourist taxies.
PSS Appeals allowed.
