The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Sikri CJ.
448 This is an appeal by the Union of India by way of special leave.
On April 9 1959 the Central Government directed removal from service of Capt section K Rao under r 14 of the Army Rules 1954.
It was alleged that on April 4 1958 he committed acts of gross misconduct.
As he was of opinion that trial of the officer by a General Court Martial was inexpedient he ordered administrative action to be taken under r 14 of the Army Rules 1954.
By memorandum dated September 4 1958 Rao was called upon to submit his explanation by way of defence regarding the allegations against him.
The Central Government found it to be unsatisfactory and on April 9 1959 an order was passed removing the respondent from service.
Rao thereupon filed a petition under article 226 of the Constitution for quashing the order of removal from service on the 449 ground inter alia that r 14 of the Army Rules 1954 was ultra vires the  and that the action taken thereunder was without any authority.
The Army Rules 1954 including r 14 were framed in exer cise of the powers conferred by section 191 of the .
2 In the event of the explanation of the officer being considered unsatisfactory by the C in C or when so directed by the Central Government the case shall be submitted to the Central Government with the officer s defence and the recommendation of the C in C as to whether the officer should be a dismissed from the service or b removed from the service or c called upon to retire or d called upon to resign.
 section 19 Subject to the provisions of this Act and the rules and regulations made thereunder the Central Government may dismiss or remove from the service any person subject to this Act.
Rule 14 is such a rule  it is therefore not ultra vires.
It was argued that the words subject to the provisions of this Act occurring in section 19 makes section 19 subject to section 45 and the Central Government has thus no power to remove a person from the service in derogation of the provisions of section 45.
