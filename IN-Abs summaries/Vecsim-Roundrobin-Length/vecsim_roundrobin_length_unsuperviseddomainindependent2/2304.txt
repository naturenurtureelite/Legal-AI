Appeals by special leave from the judgment and order dated  March 6 1967 of the Orissa High Court in OJC Nos.
 NM Patnaik and Vinoo Bhagar for respondents Nos.
All these officers are the members of the Orissa Judicial Service within the meaning of that expression in article 236b of the Constitution.
The High Court was repeatedly requesting the government to send back judicial officers working in administrative posts as district judges or as addl.
But when it came to the question of implementing that policy the government was reluctant.
As mentioned earlier member sales tax tribunal was an ex cadre post.
AS seen earlier he was holding the post in question ever since 1962In those circumstances the High Court was entitled to recall him and post him as a district and sessions judge.
Before going into the validity of the orders of transfer relating to the other officers it is necessary to ascertain the law bearing on the subject.
As seen earlier the cadre of the superior judicial service senior branch consisted of not only the posts of district and sessions judges and addl.
Before considering the correctness of that submission it is necessary to notice that this argument breaks down when we come to the question of filling up the post of the Registrar.
1  2  161 namely whether the power to transfer District Judges is included in the control  exercisable by the High Court over District Courts under article 235 or in the power of appointment of persons to be and the posting and promotion of district judges  which is to be exercised by the Governor under article 233 albeit in consultation with the High Court.
