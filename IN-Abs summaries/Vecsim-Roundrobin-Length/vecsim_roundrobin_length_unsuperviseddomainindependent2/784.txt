A V Viswanatha Sastri V Vedantachari and K Sundararajan for the appellant.
August 14.
On the same date the appellant applied to the Collector for confirmation of the lease granted by the Rajah to him.
Instructions appear to have been issued to the manager of the Venkatagiri estate requiring him to take over possession of the slate quarries which were then being worked by the appellant immediately after the expiry of two months  notice issued to him.
In the meantime on September 21 1955 the appellant had applied to the Board of Revenue Andhra for renewal of the lease under r 47 of the Mineral Concession Rules 1949.
2 The person whose right has been terminated by the Government under the foregoing proviso shall be entitled to compensation from the Government which shall be determined by the Board of 557 Revenue in such manner as may be prescribed having regard to the value of the right and the unexpired portion of the period for which the right was created.
In other words the third proviso according to learned counsel 559 for the appellant merely enables the Government to exercise the right conferred on it by the second proviso and therefore the Government if it intends to avail itself of the right under the second proviso must comply with the conditions laid down in the third proviso.
If the third proviso also applies to such leases as the petitioners contend then the lease can be terminated only if the Government is satisfied that it is in the public interest that it should be terminated and that further in such cases the lessee will also be entitled to compensation under section 202.
