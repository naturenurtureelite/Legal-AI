JD Jain  Mrs Kawaljit Kocher for the Appellant.
Harbans Lal IS Goel  RN Poddar for the Respondent.
He was therefore entitled to be absorbed in Government service as a clerk in any event.
But as a result of the deletion of section 33 of the Act by the Amending Act of 1973 the Panchayat Samiti lost its power to make appointments to the Panchayat.
737 It is urged by Shri Jain who appears on behalf of the appellant that by reason of section 144 of the Amending Act the appellant was entitled to continue in the service of the Panchayat on the same terms and conditions on which he was employed by the Panchayat Samiti until he was absorbed in Government service.
Since the appellant according to the terms and conditions of his service with the Panchayat was entitled to be considered for promotion to the post of a Head Clerk his appointment as a Head Clerk prior to his absorption in Government service had to be recognised and protected despite the fact that such appointment was made after June 13 1973 when the Amending Act came into force.
Clearly it had fortified that right on June 13 1973.
He was appointed lawfully to the post of a Clerk and that is the post in which the Government has absorbed him.
For these reasons the appeal fails and is dismissed.
SR Appeal dismissed.
