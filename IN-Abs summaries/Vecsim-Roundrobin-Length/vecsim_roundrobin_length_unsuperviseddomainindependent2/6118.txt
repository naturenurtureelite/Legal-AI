Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India.
The petitioners are carpenters 1st and 2nd grade employed at the Wood Working Centre of the Himachal Pradesh State Handicrafts Corporation the Corpo ration.
In this petition under Article 32 of the Constitution they are seeking enforcement of their fundamental right to have equal pay for equal work.
A little more information about the purpose and object of the Corporation would be useful for proper understanding of the case.
During the period of training the trainees are paid a stipend by the Corporation.
Apart from giving training the Corporation also ensures marketing support to the artisans and craftsmen by purchasing their products at remunerative prices and sell them through the marketing network of the Corporation.
It is thus a service oriented organisation helping the village artisans and craftsmen to produce and market their products on remunerative prices.
But to avoid or minimise further loss it is stated that the Corporation has reduced its overheads and maintained only the administrative staff in the production centers at different parts of the State and no permanent craftsmen are employed.
He claimed equal salary for equal work at that of other drivers.
Apart from that the Court has expressly observed that the higher pay scale to avoid stagnation or resultant frustration for lack of promotional avenues may also be allowed.
His case was based on the allegations that he was discharging same duties and performing similar functions as Senior Speech Therapist Senior Physiotherapist Senior Occupa tional Therapist Audiologist and Speech Pathologist.
From the averments in the pleadings of the parties it will be clear that the Corporation has no regularly employed carpenters.
In the result the petition fails and is dismissed.
