Civil Appeal No 159 of 1974.
488 N N Goswamy and Arvind Minocha for the appellant.
In appeal by the defendant the decree was reversed.
Against that decree an appeal was preferred by the appellant to the High Court.
 489 We do not think that the view of the High Court was correct.
As already stated the contention of the defendant was that though the properties belonged to the Dera he was its lawfully appointed mahant and that the appellant had no right to recover possession of the property of the Dera.
 This rule is based on the principle that trial of a suit cannot be brought to an end merely because the interest of a party in the subject matter of the suit has devolved upon another during the pendency of the suit but that suit may be continued against the person acquiring the interest with the leave of the Court.
VPS Appeal allowed.
