From the Judgment  Order dated the 27101979 of the Madras High Court in Crl.
AS Nambiar and KR Nambiar for the Appellant.
V Krishnamurthy for the Respondent.
He took charge of the office on 6101975 and had been residing in a house opposite the training school.
On 21101975 the appellant is stated to have pressed the demand to PW 1.
As instructed PW 1 was ready with ten rupees currency notes.
PW 1 handed over the money to the appellant who received the same.
The appellant produced the currency notes.
Finally the appellant was chargesheeted.
At the trial the prosecution witnesses supported the case.
Before the High Court the contentions of the appellant were that there was no independent evidence regarding the demand the messenger who had contacted PW 1 at the 337 behest of the appellant had not been examined the solitary evidence of PW 1 is insufficient the explanation offered by the appellant was probable and there is no conclusive evi dence to hold that the appellant.
It was also urged that the appellant being new in the office could exert little influence on the Principal and the whole story is therefore improbable.
It took the view that the evidence of PW 1 find corroboration in the testimony of PW 2 and 6 and the contemporary records.
It cannot therefore be said that there had been consistent explanation for the appellant.
P 2 memo had been issued on the basis of the complaint received from the appellant that on getting the explanation from PW 1 he on 18101975 itself passed orders and closed the file.
Of course it is open to that person to show that though that money was not due to him as legal remuneration it was legally due to him in some other manner or that he had received it under a transaction or an arrangement which was lawful.
NVK Appeal dismissed.
