cellaneous Petition No 32937 of 1988.

The factory gate here means the deemed factory gate as if the processed fabric was sold by the processor.
In order to explain the position it is made clear by the following illustration if the value of the grey cloth in the hands of the processor is Rs20 and the value of the job work done is Rs5 and the manufacturing profit and expenses for the processing be Rs5 then in such a case the value would be Rs30 being the value of the grey cloth plus the value of the job work done plus manufac turing profit and expenses.
That would be the correct as sessable value.
Rule 174 of the Central Excise Rules 1944 346 enjoins that when goods owned by one person are manufactured by another the information is required relating to the price at which the said manufacturer is selling the said goods and the person so authorised agrees to discharge all the liabil ities under the said Act and the rules made thereunder.
It is necessary to include the processor s expenses costs and charges plus profit but it is not necessary to include the trader s profits who gets the fabrics processed because those would be post manufacturing profits.
