The Market Committees.
In Madras State as in other parts of the country various Commissions and Committees have been appointed to investigate the problem to suggest ways and means of providing a fair deal to the growers of crops particularly commercial crops and find a market for selling their produce at proper rates.
Several Committees in their reports considered this question and suggested that a satisfactory system of agricultural marketing should be introduced to achieve the object of helping the agriculturists to secure a proper return for the produce grown by them.
It is also said that when a market is established no licence to purchase or sell commercial crops will be granted or renewed in respect of any place situated within such distance from the market as may from time to time be fixed by the State Government and that nothing under the Act prevents the Government from fixing a long distance as a prohibited area with the result that a person who is having a licence to trade in and about the place where the market is fixed is deprived of his livelihood which is an unreasonable restriction upon his right to do business.
If on the other hand mahimai  is a trade allowance the said part of the 109 bye law will be superfluous as the allowance falls within the terms of the section itself This leads us to the question whether  mahimai  is a trade allowance within the meaning of section 14 of the Act.
