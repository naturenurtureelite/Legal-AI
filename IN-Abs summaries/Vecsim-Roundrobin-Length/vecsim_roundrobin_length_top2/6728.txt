Special Leave Petition Nos.
823 24 of 1990.
321  322 of 1989.
SR Bhat for the Petitioners.
RN Narasimha Murthy KH Nobin Singh M Veerappa and SN Bhatt for the Respondents.
The petitioners were the owners of certain lands which were acquired by the respondents under the provisions of Sections 17 and 19 of the Bangalore Development Act 1976 hereinafter referred to as the Bangalore Act.
That contention was repelled along with certain other contentions in the judgment of the High Court which is sought to be impugned before us.
Under the first proviso to Section 11 A it was prescribed that where the said declaration under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act has been published before the commencement of the Land Acquisition Amendment Act 1984 the award must be made within a period of two years from such commencement.
Thus the award should have been made within two years from September 20 1984.
On December 16 17 1987 two writ petitions were field by the respective petitioners in the Karnataka High Court challenging the acquisition on the ground that the awards were not made within the stipulated time.
Appeals against the decision of a learned Single Judge were dismissed by the Karnataka High Court on October 6 1989 by a Division Bench of that High Court.
It is well settled in law that the relief under Article 136 of the Constitution is discretionary and a petitioner who approaches this Court for such relief must come with frank and full disclosure of facts.
If he fails to do so and suppresses material facts his application is liable to be dismissed.
There will be no order as to costs of these petitions.
RP SLPs dismissed.
