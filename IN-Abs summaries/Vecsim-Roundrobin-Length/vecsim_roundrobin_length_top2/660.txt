On the other hand the High Court indicated that it was inclined to accept the plea raised by respondent 1 that Lakshmamma had transferred all her interest in the properties comprised in the said deed of gift in favour of her husband Sadagopalachar and since in its opinion  Lakshmamms at no time appears to have claimed that she had any interest in those properties there was considerable force in the argument urged by respondent 1 that LakShmamma must have relinquished her interest in the said properties and waived her rights in favour of her husband .
In pursuance of this certificate the High Court ordered that the appeal to this Court should be admitted and so this appeal has come to this Court.
A 1 to A 5.
He was not present when the will was written.
He has spoken to the instructions received by him from Lakshmamma a year before the date of the execution of the will and he has stated that he prepared a draft at Mysore a day before the will was executed and that the will was written by the scribe as he dictated the contents from the said draft.
That is the whole of the evidence led by the appellant on the question of the execution of the will.
