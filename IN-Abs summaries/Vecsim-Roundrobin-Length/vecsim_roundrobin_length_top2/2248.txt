 The Company thereupon filed an appeal before the Standing Committee Zila Parishad Nagpur hereinafter referred to as the Standing Committee on October 22 1963.
Before we deal with these points it is necessary to set out the relevant statutory provisions.
Procedure for levying tax or fee.
But the learned counsel for the Company Mr Ashok Sen argues that this interpretation is not correct because para 2 of r4 says that the tax shall accordingly be levied from the date which shall be specified in the notice and he says that if the octroi limits had not been approved of by the time the resolution is passed how could the tax be levied from the date specified in the notice.
But r4 has to be read alongwith r21 and if so read it would mean that before the octroi duty can start being levied r21 must be complied with.
He says that this point was raised before the High Court but it has not been 221 A dealt with by it.
