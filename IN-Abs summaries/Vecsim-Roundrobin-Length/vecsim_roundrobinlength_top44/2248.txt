Appeal No 1375 of 1966.
Appeal from the judgment and order dated October 22 1965 of the Bombay High Court Nagpur Bench in Special Civil Application No 355 of 1964.
B R Agarwala and section B Nerkar for respondent No 1.
A K Sen A section Bobde G L Sanghi and O C Mathur for respondent No 2.
 The Company thereupon filed an appeal before the Standing Committee Zila Parishad Nagpur hereinafter referred to as the Standing Committee on October 22 1963.
Before we deal with these points it is necessary to set out the relevant statutory provisions.
Fixing of octroi limits and nakas.
A Panchayat shall with the approval of the Collector or of any officer authorised by the Collector not below the rank of Mamlatdar Tehsildar Naib Tehsildar or Mahalkari fix octroi limits and the number and location of octroi Nakas within 219 the limits of its jurisdiction.
Payment of octroi on introduction of goods etc.
 Rules 30 31 32 and 33 deal with refund of octroi.
But r4 has to be read alongwith r21 and if so read it would mean that before the octroi duty can start being levied r21 must be complied with.
Apart from the fact that it may in certain circumstances lead to illegal levies there is nothing in the language of r21 which indicates that the Collector can regularise an imposition made without the authority of law.
