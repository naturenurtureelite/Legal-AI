SR Bhat for the Petitioners.
RN Narasimha Murthy KH Nobin Singh M Veerappa and SN Bhatt for the Respondents.
That contention was repelled along with certain other contentions in the judgment of the High Court which is sought to be impugned before us.
On September 20 1984 Section 11 A which introduced into the Land Acquisition Act by the Land Acquisition Amendment Act 1984 was brought into force.
On September 11 1985 the petitioners obtained an interim order from this Court directing status quo with regard to the possession of the lands in question in Special Leave Petition No 294 of 1985 preferred against the order of the Karnataka High Court dated August 14 1984 with which we are not directly concerned here.
On December 16 17 1987 two writ petitions were field by the respective petitioners in the Karnataka High Court challenging the acquisition on the ground that the awards were not made within the stipulated time.
In these two writ petitions the Karnataka High Court granted interim stay of further proceedings in respect of the acquisition of the said lands.
Curiously enough there is no reference in the Special Leave Petitions to any to the stay orders and we came to know about these orders only when the respondents appeared in response to the notice and filed their counter affidavit.
In our view the said interim orders have a direct bearing on the question raised and the non disclosure of the same certainly amounts to suppression of material facts.
On this ground alone the Special Leave Petitions are liable to be rejected.
There will be no order as to costs of these petitions.
RP SLPs dismissed.
