JD Jain  Mrs Kawaljit Kocher for the Appellant.
Harbans Lal IS Goel  RN Poddar for the Respondent.
He was confirmed in that post in course of time.
On January 21 1974 he was promoted as a Head Clerk on an ad hoc basis.
On April 1 1975 the appellant was appointed as a Head Clerk.
A plain consequence of this deletion was that the Panchayat Samitis were divested of their power to make appointments to the Panchayats.
But as a result of the deletion of section 33 of the Act by the Amending Act of 1973 the Panchayat Samiti lost its power to make appointments to the Panchayat.
Even assuming for the purposes of argument that the right to be considered for promotion is a term and condition of service what is relevant for our purpose is not whether the appellant was entitled to be considered for promotion but whether the Panchayat Samiti had the right to appoint him to the post of Head Clerk on the date on which it purported to do so.
It could not therefore have appointed the appellant as a Head Clerk as it purported to do in January 1974 on an ad hoc basis or in April 1975 on a regular basis.
For these reasons the appeal fails and is dismissed.
There will be no order as to costs.
SR Appeal dismissed.
