See Secretary of State for India in Council vs Hindustan Co operative Insurance Society Limited Craies on Statute Law 7th Edition pages 360 361 The principle broadly is that where a statute is incorporated by reference into a second statute the repeal of the first statute by a third does not affect the second see Clarke vs Bradlaugh.
As observed in Nathella Sampathu Chetty there is a distinction between a mere reference to or a citation of one statute in another and an incorporation which in effect means the bodily lifting of the provisions of one enactment and making them part of another so much so that the repeal of the former leaves the latter wholly untouched.
14 Section 69d of the Act of 1973 must accordingly be read to mean that respondent 1 shall have all the powers of taxation which a Municipal Corporation or a Municipal Council has for the time being that is to say at the time when respondent 1 seeks to exercise those powers.
A reading of the reference to the two earlier Municipal Acts as a reference to those Acts as they stand at the time when the power of taxation is sought to be exercised by respondent 1 will not possibly cause repugnancy between the two earlier Acts on one hand and the Act of 1973 on the other nor indeed will it cause any confusion in the practical application of the earlier Acts because the Act of 1973 does not contain any independent provision or machinery for exercising the power of taxation.

Basing himself on that consideration the Attorney General argues 1 By virtue of the declaration contained in section 2 of Mines and Minerals Development and Regulation Act 1957 the legislative field covered by Entry 23 19 List II passed on the Parliament by virtue of Entry 54 List I 2 The Parliament enacted the Coal Mines Nationalisation Act 1973 for acquisition of coal mines with a view to reorganising and reconstructing such coal mines so as to ensure the rational coordinated and scientific development and utilisation of coal resources as best to subserve the common good.
3 Under section 5 of the Nationalisation Act the acquired properties were vested in a Government Company in order to carry out more conveniently the object of that Act and for that purpose the properties were freed from all encumbrances by section 6 of the Act.
4 The taxing power of the State legislature must be construed as limited in its scope so as not to come in conflict with the power and function of the Union to regulate and develop the mines as envisaged by the Nationalisation Act.
Apart from the fact that there is no data before us showing that the property tax constitutes an impediment in the achievement of the goals of the Coal Mines Nationalisation Act the provisions of the MP Act of 1973 under which Special Areas and Special Area Development Authorities are constituted afford an effective answer to the Attorney General s contention.
That the declaration in section 2 of the does not result in invalidation of every State legislation relating to mines and minerals is demonstrated effectively by the decision in State of Haryana  Anr.
