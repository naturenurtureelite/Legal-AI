In support of the petition the appellants urged that section 12 under which the respondent purported to act authorised the cancellation of only leases granted by the evacuee and not by the Custodian himself and that no directions could be given under section 10 as it applied only to properties of the evacuee and that by reason of the sale the movables in question had become the property of the appel 124 980 lants.
And it provides that the Explanation shall be inserted and shall be deemed always to have been inserted in the section.
Mr Desai learned counsel for the appellants concedes that this amendment which is retrospective in operation would govern the rights of the parties in the present appeal and that under the section as it now stands the Custodian has the power and had always the power to cancel leases created not merely by the evacuees but also by himself.
But he con tends that this power could be exercised only so as to override a bar imposed by any law but not the contract under which the lease is held and this result flows according to him from the language of the non obstante clause which is limited to anything contained in any other law for the time being in force and does not include or any contract between the parties.
It was next contended by Mr Desai that even if the Custodian had the power under section 12 to cancel the lease in favour of the appellants be bad no power under that section to cancel the agreement to sell the mills and the factory to them which was one of the matters contained in Exhibit A that the notice Exhibit C was to that extent without jurisdiction and that the respondent should accordingly be prohibited from cancelling that portion of Exhibit A in pursuance of Exhibit C.
Tendolkar J stated in his judgment and quite correctly that these were the two points that rose for determination.
