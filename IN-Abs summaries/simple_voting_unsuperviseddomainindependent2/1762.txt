Appeals from the judgment and decree dated May 2 1960 of the Rajasthan High Court in Civil Second Appeal Nos.
The respondent however was not able to export the entire quantity of 15000 maunds for which the permit was granted he could only export 4572 maunds and 20 seers of chuni before December 2 1947.
By May 15 1949 the United State of Rajasthan was formed including the Matsya Union into which the former State of Dholpur had merged on March 17 1948.
The United State of Rajasthan eventually became the Part B State of Rajasthan on January 26 1950 when the Constitution came into force.
The suits were resisted by the State of Rajasthan on various grounds but we are concerned now only with one ground which alone has been urged before us namely that the State of Rajasthan was not bound by any liability which might have arisen against the former State of Dholpur.
As the United State of Raja sthan into which the former State of Dholpur came to be merged in 1949 never recognised the obligations of the former State of Dholpur it was not bound to refund the amount due to the respondents.
Provision was also made in the Covenant that all the assets and liabilities of the covenanting States shall be the assets and liabilities of the new State of Matsya.
Thereupon there was a reference to a Full Bench on the question of liability which was formulated by the learned Judges thus Whether the expression Government of the corresponding State  used in article 2952 of the Constitution with reference to Rajasthan properly means the Government of the United State of Rajasthan which was the only Indian State in existence at the time of the commencement of the Constitution or it also includes the Government of any of the Covenanting States which had integrated with the United State before the Constitution came into operation.
