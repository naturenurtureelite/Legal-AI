The respondent did not appear.
March 24 1964.
This question has to be answered in the light of the definition prescribed by section 2vi before it was amended in 1958.
The subsequent amendment expressly provides by section 2vi a that any remuneration payable under any award or settlement between the parties or order of a Court would be included in the main definition under section 2vi.
The point which we have to decide in the present appeal is whether the remuneration payable under an award was not already included in the definition of wages before the said definition was amended.
 10  per day and that led to the present claim made by the respondents under section 15 of the Act.
It urged that section 15 of the Act was inapplicable because the rates of wages fixed by the award did not fall within the definition of wages prescribed by section 2vi and it also argue that the claim of the respondents was barred by limitation.
421 The authority has found that section 2vi includes wages prescribed by the Industrial Tribunal and so it has rejected the appellants  contention that the applications made by the respondents were incompetent under section 15 of the Act.
The High Court has affirmed the finding of the authority and held that section 15 was applicable to the case because the wages prescribed by the award did amount to wages as defined by section 2vi of the Act.
