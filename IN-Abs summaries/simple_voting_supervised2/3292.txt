Against that decree an appeal was preferred by the appellant to the High Court.
Thereafter the appellant prayed before the High Court that his application dated 1 2 1971 might be treated as an application for setting aside the abatement of the appeal and the ground for setting aside the abatement was that the appellant did not know about the death of Som Dass at the time he died.
As already stated the contention of the defendant was that though the properties belonged to the Dera he was its lawfully appointed mahant and that the appellant had no right to recover possession of the property of the Dera.
When Som Dass died the interest which was the subject matter of the suit devolved upon Shiam Das as he was elected to be the Mahant of the Dera and the appeal could be continued under Q 22 r 10 of the Civil Procedure Code against the person upon whom the interest had devolved.
The subject matter of the suit was the interest of Som Dass in the Dera and its properties and it devolved upon shiam Dass by virtue of his election as mahant subsequent to the death of Som Dass.
VPS Appeal allowed.
