The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR J.
This is an appeal by special leave against the judgment and order of the High Court of Bombay reversing the judgment of the Chief Presidency Magistrate Bombay and thus convicting accused Nos 1  5 under section 311 read with section 331 of the XIV of 1947 hereinafter called the Act and sentencing accused No 1 to a fine of Rs 250 and accused No 5 to a fine of Rs 50 736 The appellants are the Andheri Marol Kurla Bus Service who was accused No 1 now appellant No 1 and its Manager H M Khan who was accused No 5 now appellant No 2.
On December 31 1951 the appellant No I was asked to appear before the Conciliation Officer on January 9 1952 and after getting one adjournment the appellant No I appeared before the Conciliation Officer on January 17 1952 and filed its Written Statement and raised various objections.
The Act provides for commencement and conclusion of conciliation proceedings under section 20 but the first sub section of section 20 deals with what are called utility services and sub section 2 of that section provides as to when the conciliation proceedings conclude.
It was next contended that on this interpretation the conciliation proceedings could be prolonged much beyond what was contemplated by the Act and the termination would depend upon how soon a report is received by the appropriate Government.
