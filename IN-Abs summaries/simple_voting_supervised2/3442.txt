B D Bal with A G Ratnaparkhi for the appellant.
The learned District Judge reversed the decision of the Charity Commissioner by his order of October 16 1959 and declared the Sansthan to be a private property and not a public trust.
Hence this appeal by special leave which was obtained on March 29 1968 after condonation of delay in the peculiar circumstances of the case arising out of revocation by the High Court of its earlier certificate in favour of the appellant on account of default of deposit of security.
In the absence of anything to the contrary of a convincing nature a grant by the Government in favour of the temple describing the property to be in charge of a manager leads to an unerring inference that the property is a public religious endowment.
From the evidence of Ramkrishna Deshpande one of the constituted attornies we find the origin and the devolution as follows The originator of this Sansthan is Sakharambuwa.
Then came Prahladbuwa.
After him the present Buwa Purshottam came to Gadi.
This Gadi goes to Shishya from the Guru.
This evidence of Ramkrishna Deshpande stands corroborated by the Sanad which shows in the year 1860 61 the Manager of the Sansthan as Balkrishnabuwa Guru Govindbuwa.
Guru Govindbuwa was the second in the line of succession after Sakharam the founder and Balkrishnabuwa being the third in the line.
It is further pointed out that while nominating Prahlad as Adhikari Balkrishnabuwa stated in the said document as follows You are entitled to the ownership of all the incomes that will come before the Deity Shri Samarth and during the Swari procession as well as the income of Inam Najrana and the income of movable and immovable property.
The donor an old agriculturist of a different Taluka viz Erandole writes I give the gift deed in writing as follows With the object of giving possible help through me to the above sansthan I have given in gift my ancestral immovable property x x x x x I have given in gift the above mentioned property as aforesaid of my free will for the purpose of religious work in order that my life may be of bliss as I have no male issue and wife.
x x x x x The Dindi of the said Sansthan from Amalner remains at Shivgaon on the 30th of Jeshta vadya or on the 1st of Ashad Shudha according to practice every year.
The last deed of gift is exhibit 38 and the donee is Shri Vasudev Buwa Guru Balkrishna Buwa described as the worshipper carrying on the Vahiwat of Shri Vithal Rekhmai Sansthan.
In accordance with this theory it has been held that when property is dedicated for the worship of a family idol it is a private and not a public endowment as the persons who are entitled to worship at the shrine of the deity can only be the members of the family and that is an ascertained group of individuals.
