Taneja for the Respondents.
Feeling aggrieved by the order of dismissal of the appeal the defendants preferred separate Second Appeals Nos.
The High Court therefore held that the decree passed by the Civil Court was unsustainable.
The first ground on which the High Court dismissed the suit is that the suit was barred by the principle of res judicata in view of the dismissal of the former suit No 15768.
That suit was for a declaration that the plaintiff was a lessee and for an injunction to restrain the defendants from interfering with his possession of the suit property.
The lite is also the same.
The relief is only a consequence.
Rule 2 thereof requires that the plaintiff shall include the whole of his claim in the framing of the suit.
Sub rule 1 of Rule 2 inter alia provides that every suit shall include the whole of the claim which the plaintiff is entitled to make in respect of the cause of action.
Ever where a tenant apprehends that his possession is likely to be interfered with contrary to the provisions of the Act he can make an application in the prescribed manner to the Mamlatdar for safeguarding the same.
So also where a tenant is evicted illegally section 82 permits him to approach the Mamlatdar for recovery of possession.
Thus the amendment came into force during the pendency of the suit.
By virtue of section 7 any question whether a person is a tenant or a deemed tenant was required to be decided by the Mamlatdar and the jurisdiction of the Civil Court stood ousted by section 582 of the Act.
However during the pendency of the suit a notification was issued under section 6 of the Bombay Rents Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act 1947 hereinafter called the Rent Act  applying Part II of the Act to areas where the property in question was situate.
However the Act does not preclude the institution of a suit by a tenant for restoration of possession from a trespasser.
