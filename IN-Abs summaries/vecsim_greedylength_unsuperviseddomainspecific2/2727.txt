Appeal No 1671 of 1966.
Appeal from the judgment and decree dated March 31 1965 of the Madras High Court in Appeal No 276 of 1962.
MK Ramamurthi Vineet Kumar L Ramamurthy and Shyamala Pappu for the appellant.
AV Rangam for the respondents.
425 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Ramaswami J.
According to the appellant the temple was rounded two hundred years ago by the members of his community and since then the management of the temple and is affairs was always vested in the community of the Sengunatha Mudaliars and no person other than the elected trustee had at any time the right of management and control of the temple.
The case of the appellant was that the trusteeship of the temple was hereditary.
The Subordinate Judge held that the appellant was a hereditary trustee and the suit was not barred by limitation.
It was said that according to the usage of the temple the trustees were elected for a period of one year each at a meeting of the members of the Sangunatha Mudaliar Community and so the appellant must be held to be a trustee within the meaning of section 69 of Act 19 of 1951.
In Sri Mahant Paramanda Das Goswami vs Radhakrishna Das1 the Madras High Court took the view that where succession to the mahantship is by nomination by the holder in office it was not a hereditary succession.
But the election to the office of trustee in the present case is for a fixed period of one year and not for life.
It is therefore difficult to hold that the office of the appellant is hereditary within the meaning of section 69 of the Act.
It is not possible to say that there is a succession of As office to another when on the efflux of the period for which A was appointed there is a vacancy and B is elected to that vacancy.
It is quite possible that for that vacancy A himself might be reelected because a retiring trustee is eligible for reelection.
For these reasons we hold that this appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs.
