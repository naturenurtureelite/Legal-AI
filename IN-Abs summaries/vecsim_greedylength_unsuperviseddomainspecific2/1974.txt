Appeal No 68 of 1964.
Appeal from the judgment and decree dated July 27 1959 of the Allahabad High Court in Income tax Reference No 307 of 1957.
AV Viswanatha Sastri and SP Varma for the respondent.
By a Treaty between the East India Company Nawab Asfuddaula in or about the year 1775 the province of Benaras was ceded to the British Government.
It appears that in 1796 there were some disputes between Babu Ausan Singh and the Zamindars in the district and the matter was referred by the Collector of Benaras to the Board of Revenue in Calcutta.
The quantum of this pension was calculated on the basis of 14th of the revenue of the Jagir.
By this arrangement the revenue or land collections of Jagir became payable by the Zamindars direct to the Government and by the grant of the pension Babu Hat Narain Singh and his successors no longer remained the proprietors of the Parganas or the Jagir and became entitled to merely a pension.
During the previous year of the assessment year 1949 50 the assessee received a sum of Rs 36396 on account of the aforesaid pension.
It relied on the fact that the amount which had been received by the successors of Babu Harnarain Singh varied from year to year.
He relies on the decision of this Court in State of Uttar Pradesh vs Kunwar Sri Trivikram Narain Singh1.
He says that if the assessee s predecessor had received  706 compensation for relinquishing his title to the lands in dispute that would have been a capital receipt and not taxable.
 He therefore asked us to disregard the word pension  in the letter dated July 7 1837 and determine the real character of the payment.
Another passage from the speech of Viscount Simon is also relevant.
If the other method is adopted tax will not be payable .
Appeal allowed.
