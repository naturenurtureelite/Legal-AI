N C Chatterjee Janaradan Sharma K B Rohtagi and section Balakrishnan for the appellant in CA No 931 of 1965 and the respondent in C A No 1149 of 1965.
These appeals arise out of an election to a seat in the West Bengal Legislative Assembly from the Khargram Murshidabad constitutency reserved for members of the Scheduled Castes.
The objection was rejected by the Returning Officer.
article 341 gives power to the President to specify by public notification the castes or parts of or groups within castes which shall for the purpose of the Constitution be deemed to be Scheduled Castes.
In the election petition the respondent had stated that the appellant was a member of the Saha caste and not a member of any Schedule Caste.
The learned Judges of the High Court thought that the effect of the item was to exclude from the Sunri caste those who belonged to that caste but bore the surname Saha.
Nobody disputes that.
Sunri in item 40 therefore.
A method of interpreting a statutory provision which might lead to such uncertainty cannot be correct.
The result then is that the appellant is a Sunri by caste and has not been proved to belong to the smaller caste group of Sahas.
