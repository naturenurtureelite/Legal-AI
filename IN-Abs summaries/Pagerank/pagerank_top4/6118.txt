It was pointed out that in service merit or experience could be the proper basis for classification to promote efficiency in administration and he or she learns also by experience as much as by other means.
His case was based on the allegations that he was discharging same duties and performing similar functions as Senior Speech Therapist Senior Physiotherapist Senior Occupa tional Therapist Audiologist and Speech Pathologist.
If the classification has reasonable nexus with the objective sought to be achieved efficiency in the administration the State would be justified in prescribing different pay scales.
Reference may also be made to the decision in Federation of All India Customs and Central Excise Stenographers Recognised vs Union of India  There the Personal Assistants and Stenographers attached to the Heads of Department in Customs and Central Excise Department of the Ministry of Finance made a claim for parity of wages with the Personal Assistants and Stenographers attached to Joint Secretaries and Officers above them in Ministry of Finance.
From the averments in the pleadings of the parties it will be clear that the Corporation has no regularly employed carpenters.
In the first place even assum ing that the petitioners  jobs are comparable with the counterparts in the government service the petitioners cannot enforce the right to equal pay for equal work.
Unless it is shown that there is a discrimination amongst the same set of employees by the same master in the same establishment the principle of equal pay for equal work cannot be enforced.
The Court therefore cannot direct the Corporation to apply the rates prescribed under exhibit P 2 unless the Government makes it applicable to employees of the Corporation.
In the result the petition fails and is dismissed.
