iminal Appeal No 46 of 1957.
Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated the February 4 1955 of the Bombay High Court in Criminal Appeal No 1256 of 1954 arising out of the judgment and order dated June 19 1954 of the Chief Presidency Magistrate Bombay in Case No 176S of 1953.
Hardayal Hardy for the appellants.
H J Umrigar and B H Dhebar for the respondent.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR J.
On December 31 1951 the appellant No I was asked to appear before the Conciliation Officer on January 9 1952 and after getting one adjournment the appellant No I appeared before the Conciliation Officer on January 17 1952 and filed its Written Statement and raised various objections.
From this it was submitted that as 14 days had expired before March 18 1952 the dismissal could not be said to be one within the words  pendency of conciliation proceedings .
The Act provides for commencement and conclusion of conciliation proceedings under section 20 but the first sub section of section 20 deals with what are called utility services and sub section 2 of that section provides as to when the conciliation proceedings conclude.
It was contended that the conciliation proceedings should be held to terminate when the Conciliation Officer is required under section 126 of the Act to submit his report but the provisions of the Act above quoted do not support this contention as the termination of the conciliation proceedings is deemed to take place when the report is received by the appropriate Government.
The appeal is therefore dismissed.
