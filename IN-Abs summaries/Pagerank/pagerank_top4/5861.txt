It is pertinent to all such cases.
The question is whether there could be two scales of pay in the same cadre of persons performing the same or similar work or duties.
Directive Principlesas has been pointed out in some of the judgments of this Court have to be read into the fundamental rights as a matter of interpretation.
Article 39d of the Constitution proclaims equal pay for equal work .
Even in Randhir Singh s case this principle has been recognised.
If it has a rational nexus with the object to be sought for as reiterated before a certain amount of value judgment of the administrative authorities who are charged with fixing the pay scales has to be left with them and it cannot be interfered with by the Court unless it is demonstrated that either it is irrational or based on no basis or arrived mala fide either in law or in fact.
