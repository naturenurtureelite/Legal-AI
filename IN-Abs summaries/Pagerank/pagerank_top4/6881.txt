In that case also this Court held that the right of pre emption vested in co shar ers was a reasonable restriction on the right to hold acquire or dispose of property conferred by Article 1911 of the Constitution.
Under the Punjab Pre emption Act 1905 the corresponding provision section 12 con ferred a right of pre emption in the case of a sale of a share of such land or properly held jointly firstly in the lineal discendents of the vendor in male line in order of succession secondly in the co sharers if any who are agnates in order of succession thirdly in the persons described in sub clause a ie in persons who but for such sale would be entitled to inherit the properly in the event of his or their decease in order of succession and fourth ly in the co sharers jointly or severally.
We find it diffi cult to hold that the purport of the of Court s decision in Attam Prakash s case was to deny the right of pre emption to those relative or relatives of the vendor or vendors who were specified in the erstwhile first three clauses of section 151b even if they happen to be co sharers.
What this Court disapproved as offen sive to Articles 14 and 15 is the classification based on consanguinity and not on co ownership.
We therefore do not approve the ratio of Jagdish s case and overrule the same.
