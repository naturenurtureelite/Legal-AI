4 5 6 7  J 92  8 AIR 413 High Court India Nutriments Ltd vs Registrar of Companies1 and PSNSA Chettiar  Company vs Registrar of Companies2 of the Madras High Court.
The Orissa High Court had taken a similar view in Registrar of Companies vs Misra 3 but in a latter decision in Vulcan Industries P Ltd vs Registrar of Companies Orissa4 it has taken a contrary view and followed the decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in the judgment under appeal.
6 have also taken a similar view.
Solicitor General who appeared for the State of Andhra Pradesh and the learned Solicitor General who appeared for the Advocate General of Andhra Pradesh fairly placed before this Court all the decisions for and against which we have already referred to and also placed before us all the relevant considerations.
Section 32 relates to the preparation of a list of members of the company and of persons who have ceased to be members as well as a summary and also provides that it shall be completed within 21 days after the day of the first or only ordinary general meeting in the year.
But section 134 lays down that after balance sheet and profit and loss account or the income and expenditure account as the case may be have been laid before the company at the general meeting three copies thereof shall be filed with the registrar and a failure to do so is made punishable under sub section 4 of that section.
The appeal is dismissed.
VPS Appeal dismissed.
