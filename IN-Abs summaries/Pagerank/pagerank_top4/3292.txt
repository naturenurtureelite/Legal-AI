Civil Appeal No 159 of 1974.
488 N N Goswamy and Arvind Minocha for the appellant.
Against that decree an appeal was preferred by the appellant to the High Court.
An application was made on 1 2 1971 by the appellant stating that Som Dass died on 26 11 1970 leaving behind him Shiam Dass as his Chela and for impleading him.
The High Court referred the question to the trial Court for enquiry and decision.
 This rule is based on the principle that trial of a suit cannot be brought to an end merely because the interest of a party in the subject matter of the suit has devolved upon another during the pendency of the suit but that suit may be continued against the person acquiring the interest with the leave of the Court.
When a suit is brought by or against a person in a representative capacity and there is a devolution of the interest of the representative the rule that has to be applied is Order 22 rule 10 and not rule 3 or 4 whether the devolution takes place as a consequence of death or for any other reason.
VPS Appeal allowed.
