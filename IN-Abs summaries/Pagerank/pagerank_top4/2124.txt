In the election petition the respondent had stated that the appellant was a member of the Saha caste and not a member of any Schedule Caste.
The learned Judges of the High Court thought that the effect of the item was to exclude from the Sunri caste those who belonged to that caste but bore the surname Saha.
Nobody disputes that.
The Tribunal came to its conclusion that Saha in the item referred to a caste distinct from the Sunri caste because the evidence before it did not show that there was within the Sunri caste a smaller caste group called Sahas.
For the same reason we are unable to agree with the interpretation of the High Court that the Sahas excluded were those Sunris who bore the surname Saha.
In the absence of such words Saha must in the context be understood as referring to a smaller caste group within the bigger caste group of Sunris.
It is of interest to remind in the connection that the Order provides that the Sunris in the Purulia District and those parts of the Purnea District which had been transferred to West Bengal were not to be considered as belonging to a Scheduled Caste.
