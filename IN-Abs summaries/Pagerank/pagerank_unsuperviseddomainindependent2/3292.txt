Kapil Sibbal and D Probir Mitra for respondents.
The appellant brought the suit on the allegation that there was one Shiromani Nirankari Dera at Patiala that this institution had two branches one at Landeke in Moga Tehsil and the other at Nanga Kheri in the erstwhile Patiala State and that he as mahant in charge of the Shiromani Dera at Patiala had the right to manage the properties attached to the Dera at Landeke.
The prayer in the plaint was for recovery of possession of the Dera and the properties attached to it.
Som Dass the defendant contended that the Dera at Landeke was an independent Dera and that he was in possession of the properties of the Dera as its lawfully appointed mahant.
