Admittedly no general body meeting had been held and therefore the balance sheet and profit and loss account had not been laid before a general body meeting nor could it be so laid.
The Full Bench speaking through Jaganmohan Reddy CJ as our learned brother then was held that if no balance sheet is laid before a general body there can be no question of that balance sheet not being adopted nor of complying with the requirements of section 220 and though wilful omission to call a general body meeting and to lay the balance sheet and profit and loss account before it may expose the person responsible to punishment under other provisions of the Act it certainly does not make him liable under the provisions of section 1344 of the Companies Act 1913 or section 220 of the .
The Bombay High Court however following its earlier decision in Imperator vs The Pioneer Clay and Industrial Works Ltd1 had upheld the acquittal of the directors by the Presidency Magistrate.
Referring to the decision of the Bombay High Court in that case this Court pointed out that decision turned on section 134 of the Companies Act 1913 the language of which was to a certain extent different from the language used in sections 32 and 131 and refrained from going into the question whether the difference in language in section 134 on the one hand and sections 32 and 131 on the other made any difference to the decision of the case.
 In this state of difference of opinion among the various High Courts and the absence of a decision of this Court on section 134 this appeal has been filed.
The appeal is dismissed.
