iminal Appeal No 46 of 1957.
Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated the February 4 1955 of the Bombay High Court in Criminal Appeal No 1256 of 1954 arising out of the judgment and order dated June 19 1954 of the Chief Presidency Magistrate Bombay in Case No 176S of 1953.
Hardayal Hardy for the appellants.
H J Umrigar and B H Dhebar for the respondent.
April 21.
The Chief Presidency Magistrate acquitted all the accused including the appellants and held that as the conciliation proceedings had continued for a period of more than 14 days as from January 17 1952 further proceedings for conciliation were illegal and therefore the accused persons could not be convicted under section 311of the Act.
The argument raised on behalf of the appellant is that the object of conciliation is to get a settlement made with expedition and therefore under section 12 the Conciliation Officer was bound to make his report within 14 days of the commencement of the conciliation proceedings or within such shorter period fixed by the appropriate Government.
It was next contended that on this interpretation the conciliation proceedings could be prolonged much beyond what was contemplated by the Act and the termination would depend upon how soon a report is received by the appropriate Government.
He is required to bring about settlement between the parties and must begin his investigation without delay and if no settlement is arrived at he is to submit his report to the appropriate Government.
