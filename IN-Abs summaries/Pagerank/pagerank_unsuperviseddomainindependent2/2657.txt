The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Shah J.
Ramamurthi J by order dated April 12 1968 granted an interim injunction restraining encashment of the letters of credit pending disposal of the suit.
In appeals under the Letters Patent preferred by the second defendant.
Against the orders passed in the two appeals the plaintiffs applied for certificate under Arts1331a and 1331b of the Constitution.
The High Court observed that an order granting interim injunction is a final order as far as this Court is concerned determining the rights of parties within this lit or proceeding which is independent though ancillary to the suit and they were competent to grant the certificate.
By our order dated October 28 1968 we ordered that the certificate granted by the High Court do stand revoked.

That is a matter not in dispute.
