N C Chatterjee Janaradan Sharma K B Rohtagi and section Balakrishnan for the appellant in CA No 931 of 1965 and the respondent in C A No 1149 of 1965.
DN Mukherjee for the respondent in CA No 931 of 1965 and the appellant in CA No 1149 of 1965.
Sudhir is admittedly a member of a Scheduled Caste.
At the hearing of the petition by the Election Tribunal however he challenged the election only on the ground that Abhoy Pada was a member of the Saha caste and not a member of a Scheduled Caste.
The Election Tribunal rejected this contention and dismissed the petition.
Sudhir then appealed to the High Court at Calcutta which reversed the decision of the Tribunal and declared the election of Abhoy Pada invalid and set it aside on the ground that he did not belong to a Scheduled Caste.
These two appeals are from the judgment of the High Court.
He challenges the validity of the order of the High Court setting aside his election.
The question is whether the appellant was a member of the Scheduled Caste specified in this item.
There is no doubt that Sunri is a caste.
