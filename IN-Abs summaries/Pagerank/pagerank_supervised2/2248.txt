Appeal No 1375 of 1966.
B R Agarwala and section B Nerkar for respondent No 1.
M section K Sastri R N Sachthey section P Nayar for R H Dhebar for respondent No 3.
Section 313 of the Bombay Village Panchayat Act 1958 Bombay Act III of 1959 defines octroi or octroi duty to mean a tax on the entry of goods into a village 217 for consumption use or sale therein.
Fixing of octroi limits and nakas.
 Rules 30 31 32 and 33 deal with refund of octroi.
It would be noticed that the rule which authorises the levy is r22 but it enjoins that the procedure prescribed in rr3 and 4 should be followed before the octroi duty can be levied.
Rule 3c has to be similarly read.
The inhabitants of the village would be entitled to object only to these two matters namely 1 the tax or fee imposed and the rate at which it is levied.
Under r3d what the panchayat does is to consider objections and suggestions and then finally make the choice as regards two things ie the tax or fee to be imposed and the rate at which it is to be levied.
Para 2 of the return only alleged This respondent says that at that time no copy of the Rules required to be published by Rule 4 of the Rules was exhibited along with the said Notice.
The High Court has held that as r 5 applies to all appeals under s1245 of the Panchayat Act the fixing of the commencement of the period of limitation as the date of publication of the notice under r4 for all appeals is arbitrary and destructive of the right of appeal.
