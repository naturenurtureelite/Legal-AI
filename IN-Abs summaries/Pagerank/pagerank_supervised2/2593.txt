I N Shroff for respondent No 1.
921 As observed by Gajendragadkar J as he then was in Union of lndia vs H C Goel1 the enquiry report along with the evidence recorded constitute the material on which the Government has ultimately to act.
Where immediately before the appointed day the State of Bombay is subject to any liability in respect of any actionable wrong other than breach of contract that liability shall a if the cause of action arose wholly within the territories which as from that day are the territories of the State of Maharashtra or the State of Gujarat be a liability of that State and b in any other case be initially a liability of the State of Maharashtra but subject to such financial adjustment as may be agreed upon between the States of Maharashtra and Gujarat or in default of such agreement as the Central Government may by order direct The learned counsel for the State of Maharashtra contends that the liability to pay arrears of pay was not a liability arising out of a contract but was a liability in respect of an actionable wrong other than a breach of contract.
This Court in State of Bihar vs Abdul Majid1 held that the rule of English Law that a civil servant cannot maintain a suit against the Crown for the recovery of arrears of salary does not prevail in India and it has been negatived by the provisions of the statute law in India.
Authority is not lacking even in England where a special relationship exists between the Crown and its public servants.

It seems to us that the decree of the High Court decreeing payment of arrears of salary is truly a liability in proceedings relating to a contract within section 602a of the Act.
RKPS Appeal dismissed.
