Appeal No 4366 of 1991.
It also found the list of kinsfolk entitled to pre emption as intrinsically defec tive and Self contradictory.
Finding no reasonable classifi cation it struck down 124 clauses first  secondly  and thirdly  of section 151a clauses first  secondly  and thirdly  of section 151b and clause first  secondly  and third ly  of section 151c and the entire section 152 as ultra vires the Constitution.
The right of pre emption in regard to a co sharer was upheld on the consideration that if an outsider is introduced as a co sharer in a property it will make common management extremely difficult and destroy the benefits of ownership in common.
In Atam Prakash s case this Court therefore held that what was said about the right of pre emption granted to co sharers in relation to Article 1911 of the Constitution applied with equal force to justify the classification in relation to Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution.
The 1905 Act was repealed and replaced by the 1913 Act.
This Court never intended to exclude any speci fied co owners from the scope of clause fourthly of section 151b of the Act.
If the preceding clauses were not erased from the statute book as unconstitu tional the kinsfolk would have exercised the right in the order of preference for which no justification was found.
That would clearly be discriminatory.
