DN Mukherjee for the respondent in CA No 931 of 1965 and the appellant in CA No 1149 of 1965.
Sudhir is admittedly a member of a Scheduled Caste.
Abhoy Pada described himself in the nomination paper as a member of the Sunri caste which is a Scheduled Caste.
Sudhir then filed a petition challenging the validity of Abhoy Pada s election on various grounds.
Appeal No 931 of 1965 is by Abhoy Pada.
article 332 of the Constitution provides that seats shall be reserved for the Scheduled Castes in the Legislative Assembly of every State.
Nobody disputes that.
If Sunri is a caste the word Saha  in the expression excluding Saha in the item must without more.
The error of the Tribunal lay in interpreting the Order in the light of the evidence before it.
There was no justification for doing that.
After all the evidence led in a case may be imperfect.
These witnesses were disbelieved by the Tribunal which described them as unreliable.
That being so the election petition must fail.
One set of hearing fees only.
Appeal No 931 of 1965 allowed.
Appeal No 1149 of 1965 dismissed.
