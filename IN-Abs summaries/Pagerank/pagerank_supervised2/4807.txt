Even assuming for the purposes of argument that the right to be considered for promotion is a term and condition of service what is relevant for our purpose is not whether the appellant was entitled to be considered for promotion but whether the Panchayat Samiti had the right to appoint him to the post of Head Clerk on the date on which it purported to do so.
Clearly it had fortified that right on June 13 1973.
The appointment of the appellant to the post of a Head Clerk being without the authority of law the Government was not bound to absorb him in the post of a Head Clerk.
He was appointed lawfully to the post of a Clerk and that is the post in which the Government has absorbed him.
There will be no order as to costs.
SR Appeal dismissed.
