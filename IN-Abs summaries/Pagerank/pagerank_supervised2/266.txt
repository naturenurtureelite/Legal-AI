o 196 of 1954.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by I MEHR CHAND MAHAJAN CJ.
The impugned statute admittedly was good law till the coming into force of the Constitution.
In other words it was said that the Act only dealt with that group of persons who came within the class of war profiteers.
It was further.
said that there was no substantial difference in the procedure prescribed under section 34 of the Indian Income tax Act and the impugned Act and that in any case the procedure prescribed by the Act was a good substitute for that prescribed by the Indian Income tax Act.
On a plain reading of the section it is clear that the subsection is not limited only to persons who made extraordinary profits and to a substantial extent evaded payment of taxation on income but applies to all persons who may have evaded payment of taxation on income irrespective of whether the evaded profits are substantial or insubstantial.
The State can by classification determine who should be regarded as a class for purposes of legislation and in relation to a law enacted on a particular subject but the classification permissible must be based on some real and substantial distinction bearing a just and reasonable relation  to the objects sought to be attained and cannot be made arbitrarily and without any substantial basis.
It is from this aspect that the application of article 14 to the facts of this case has to be considered.
