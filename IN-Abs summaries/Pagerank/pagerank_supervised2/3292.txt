Against that decree an appeal was preferred by the appellant to the High Court.
Thereafter the appellant prayed before the High Court that his application dated 1 2 1971 might be treated as an application for setting aside the abatement of the appeal and the ground for setting aside the abatement was that the appellant did not know about the death of Som Dass at the time he died.
When Som Dass died the interest which was the subject matter of the suit devolved upon Shiam Das as he was elected to be the Mahant of the Dera and the appeal could be continued under Q 22 r 10 of the Civil Procedure Code against the person upon whom the interest had devolved.
In Roshan Lal vs Kapur Chand the Court took the view that newly appointed trustees are not legal representatives of the trustees who had filed the suit and thereafter died during the pendency of the suit that they can be added as parties under Order 22 rule 10 notwithstanding the fact that the period of limitation for an application to 491 impleaded them under Order 22 rule 3 had elapsed.
