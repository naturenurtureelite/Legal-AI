Section 311 makes the contravention of the provision 737 of section 33 of the Act an offence punishable with imprisonment for a period which may extend to six months or with fine or with both.
The Act provides for commencement and conclusion of conciliation proceedings under section 20 but the first sub section of section 20 deals with what are called utility services and sub section 2 of that section provides as to when the conciliation proceedings conclude.
It was next contended that on this interpretation the conciliation proceedings could be prolonged much beyond what was contemplated by the Act and the termination would depend upon how soon a report is received by the appropriate Government.
