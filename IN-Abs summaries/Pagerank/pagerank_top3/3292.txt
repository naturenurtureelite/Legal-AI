488 N N Goswamy and Arvind Minocha for the appellant.
 This rule is based on the principle that trial of a suit cannot be brought to an end merely because the interest of a party in the subject matter of the suit has devolved upon another during the pendency of the suit but that suit may be continued against the person acquiring the interest with the leave of the Court.
When a suit is brought by or against a person in a representative capacity and there is a devolution of the interest of the representative the rule that has to be applied is Order 22 rule 10 and not rule 3 or 4 whether the devolution takes place as a consequence of death or for any other reason.
We are of the view that devolution of the interest in the subject matter of the suit took place when Shiam Dass was elected as mahant of the Dera after the death of Som Dass.
In Thirumalai vs Arunachella 2 the Court held that a succeeding trustee of a trustee who filed a suit and thereafter died during its pendency was not legal representative of the predecessor in office.
