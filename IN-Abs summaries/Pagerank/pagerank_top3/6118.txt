In this petition under Article 32 of the Constitution they are seeking enforcement of their fundamental right to have equal pay for equal work.
It is thus a service oriented organisation helping the village artisans and craftsmen to produce and market their products on remunerative prices.
Randhir Singh case was concerned with a driver constable in the Delhi Police Force under the Delhi Administration.
It is therefore not impermissible to provide two different pay scales in the same cadre on the basis of selection based on merit with due regard to experience and seniority.
It was pointed out that in service merit or experience could be the proper basis for classification to promote efficiency in administration and he or she learns also by experience as much as by other means.
His case was based on the allegations that he was discharging same duties and performing similar functions as Senior Speech Therapist Senior Physiotherapist Senior Occupa tional Therapist Audiologist and Speech Pathologist.
In the light of the aforesaid principles we may now consider whether the equality claims of the petitioners could be allowed.
From the averments in the pleadings of the parties it will be clear that the Corporation has no regularly employed carpenters.
In the first place even assum ing that the petitioners  jobs are comparable with the counterparts in the government service the petitioners cannot enforce the right to equal pay for equal work.
Unless it is shown that there is a discrimination amongst the same set of employees by the same master in the same establishment the principle of equal pay for equal work cannot be enforced.
It requires the consideration of various dimensions of the job.
In the result the petition fails and is dismissed.
