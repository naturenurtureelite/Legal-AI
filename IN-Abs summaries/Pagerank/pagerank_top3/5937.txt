That would be the correct as sessable value.
If the trader who entrusts cotton or man made fabric to the processor for processing on job work basis would give a declaration to the processor as to what would be the price at which he would be selling the processed goods in the market that would be taken by the Excise authorities as the assessable value of the processed fabric and excise duty would be charged to the processor on that basis provided that the declaration as to the price at which he would be selling the processed goods in the market would include only the price or deemed price at which the processed fabric would leave the processor s factory plus his profit.
Rule 174 of the Central Excise Rules 1944 346 enjoins that when goods owned by one person are manufactured by another the information is required relating to the price at which the said manufacturer is selling the said goods and the person so authorised agrees to discharge all the liabil ities under the said Act and the rules made thereunder.
It is necessary to include the processor s expenses costs and charges plus profit but it is not necessary to include the trader s profits who gets the fabrics processed because those would be post manufacturing profits.
