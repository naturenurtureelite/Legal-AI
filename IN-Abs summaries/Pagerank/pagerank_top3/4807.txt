Being aggrieved by his absorption on a lower post he filed a writ petition in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana asking that he should be absorbed as a Head Clerk.
The appellant was appointed as a clerk by the Loharu Panchayat Samiti in 1963 long before the Amending Act came into force on June 13 1973.
He was therefore entitled to be absorbed in Government service as a clerk in any event.
But as a result of the deletion of section 33 of the Act by the Amending Act of 1973 the Panchayat Samiti lost its power to make appointments to the Panchayat.
737 It is urged by Shri Jain who appears on behalf of the appellant that by reason of section 144 of the Amending Act the appellant was entitled to continue in the service of the Panchayat on the same terms and conditions on which he was employed by the Panchayat Samiti until he was absorbed in Government service.
There is no substance in this contention.
Clearly it had fortified that right on June 13 1973.
He was appointed lawfully to the post of a Clerk and that is the post in which the Government has absorbed him.
For these reasons the appeal fails and is dismissed.
There will be no order as to costs.
SR Appeal dismissed.
