Appeal by Special Leave from the Award of the Industrial Tribunal Gujarat in Reference II No 30 of 1974 pub lished in the Gujarat Govt.
The demand was resisted by the Companies in both cases.
An objection was also taken that the workmen had benefited a lot under the entire scheme of the Act and it would not be reasonable and proper to confer any addi tional benefit as the demands would place a heavy financial burden on the Company which it Could not bear.
This is why these two have become companion appeals and are being disposed of together.
It appears to us clear however that in providing for periodical payments to an insured worker in case of sickness sickness benefit or for medical treatment or attendance to him or the members of his family the legislature did not intend to substitute any of these benefits for the workmen s right to get leave on full pay on the ground of sickness.
 The matter came up again for consideration by this Court in Technological Institute of Textiles vs Its Workmen and others2 and it was held as follows with specific reference to the first proviso to section 49 of the Act according to which a person qualified to claim sickness benefit is not enti tled to it for the initial waiting period of two days except in the case of continuous illness of the nature mentioned therein With regard to sick leave the argument on behalf of the appellant was that benefits were granted by the  but that is not a bar to the demand of the workmen for sick leave.
Section 61 of the Act cannot thus be said to be applicable for the simple reason that the benefits granted by the Tribunal are not similar to those admissible under the Act.
The other question regarding the adequacy of the sick ness benefit under the provisions of the Act has been exam ined by the Tribunal with reference to the reports of the National Commission of Labour 1969 the Labour Laws Review Committee and the Norms Committee of Gujarat State which go to show that the benefit cannot be said to be adequate for it works out to about half the average wage of a workman and even that amount is not admissible for the first two days of sickness except in the case of a spell of sickness following at an interval of not more than 15 days the spell of sickness for which the sickness benefit was last paid.
It has not been disputed before us that the region cure industry basis is suitable in cases like the present for examining any controversy regarding the work man s demand for additional benefits but it has been argued by the learned counsel for the appellants that the award of the benefit of sick leave to the workers of the two Compa nies could not be justified on that basis.
In fact in the 85 case of the Alembic Glass Industries Ltd Baroda the Tribunal made an award for 7 days sick leave on full pay and dearness allowance in 1958 subject to the condition that the benefit would cease to apply when the benefits of the Act became available to the workmen.
The appeals therefore fail and are dismissed except that the award in the case of Jyoti Ltd Baroda is made effective from the date of its commencement.
