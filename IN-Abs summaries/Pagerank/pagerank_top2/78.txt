His wife who was the second accused in the case was charged with aiding and abetting her husband in the commission of the two offences.
He asked for a certificate under article 1341c of the Constitution but this was rejected on 10 4 1950.
 It was urged that the offence arises only on receipt of any sum or any consideration as a condition of the relin quishment by a tenant of his tenancy and that in the present case there was no such relinquishment.
Exhibit D which is the most material document under which the appellant handed over vacant possession of the flat to the complainant constitutes or evidences an assignment of the tenancy and not a relinquishment.
It is the landlord s consent to the transfer of a lease by sub lease or otherwise on receipt of consideration that has been made an offence.
In fact a surrender or relinquishment terminates the lessee s rights and lets in the lessor.
The section in question it should be further noted does not speak of relinquishment or giving up of possessionin general terms.
The words are the relinquishment of his tenancy of any premises.
