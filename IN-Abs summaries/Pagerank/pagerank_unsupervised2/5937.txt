The following Order of the Court was delivered ORDER In respect of the civil miscellaneous petition for clarification of this Court s judgment dated 4th November 1988 it is made clear that the assessable value of the processed fabric would be the value of the grey cloth in the hands of the processor plus the value of the job work done plus manufacturing profit and manufacturing expenses whatev er these may be which will either be included in the price at the factory gate or deemed to be the price at the factory gate for the processed fabric.
The factory gate here means the deemed factory gate as if the processed fabric was sold by the processor.
In order to explain the position it is made clear by the following illustration if the value of the grey cloth in the hands of the processor is Rs20 and the value of the job work done is Rs5 and the manufacturing profit and expenses for the processing be Rs5 then in such a case the value would be Rs30 being the value of the grey cloth plus the value of the job work done plus manufac turing profit and expenses.
That would be the correct as sessable value.
It is necessary to include the processor s expenses costs and charges plus profit but it is not necessary to include the trader s profits who gets the fabrics processed because those would be post manufacturing profits.
