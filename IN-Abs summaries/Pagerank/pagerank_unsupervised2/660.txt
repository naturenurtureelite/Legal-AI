November 13.
This appeal arises from a suit brought by the appellant in the court of the Subordinate Judge Mysore as the sole executor of the will alleged to have been executed by one Lakshmamma on August 22 1945 exhibit A.
Respondents 2 to 4 are the sons of the appellant.
Alternatively it was alleged by the appellant that even if survivorship did not apply and so her son Narayana lyengar acquired interest to half the share in the properties covered by the gift deed he had during his lifetime sold away considerable properties of his father and mother much above the value of his half share and in consequence the remaining properties which represent Lakshmamma s half share became her absolute properties.
The appellant has stated that the will was written in one room and Lakshmamma was lying in the adjoining room and it was after the will was written that the scribe went into the adjoining room and read the will to her so that the statement of the scribe that the will was written in the presence of Lakshmamma is not supported by the appellant.
Appeal dismissed.
