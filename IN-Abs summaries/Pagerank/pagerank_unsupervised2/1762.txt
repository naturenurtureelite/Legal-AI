Appeals from the judgment and decree dated May 2 1960 of the Rajasthan High Court in Civil Second Appeal Nos.
March 12 1964.
These four appeals arise out of four certi ficates granted by the High Court of Rajasthan and raise a common question.
The respondent was a resident of the former Dholpur State and the dispute which led to the suit related to a time before the merger of former Dholpur State into the Matsya Union.
It was also the practice in that State that when permits for export were issued export duties had to be paid in advance though the actual export was made later.
The respondent however was not able to export the entire quantity of 15000 maunds for which the permit was granted he could only export 4572 maunds and 20 seers of chuni before December 2 1947.
By May 15 1949 the United State of Rajasthan was formed including the Matsya Union into which the former State of Dholpur had merged on March 17 1948.
The United State of Rajasthan eventually became the Part B State of Rajasthan on January 26 1950 when the Constitution came into force.
The suits were resisted by the State of Rajasthan on various grounds but we are concerned now only with one ground which alone has been urged before us namely that the State of Rajasthan was not bound by any liability which might have arisen against the former State of Dholpur.
It is not in dispute that on this merger provision was made for the continuance of the laws in the covenanting State till such time as they were modified by the new State.
