It is against this order of the High Court that the present appeal by special leave is preferred.
With a view to preventing any such action on the part of the defendants he instituted the suit for an injunction to restrain them from so doing.
That suit however came to be dismissed as the Trial Court came to the conclusion that the plaintiff was no more in possession of the property in respect of which he claimed to be a lessee.
It was only thereafter that the plaintiff filed the suit for restoration of his possession.
In the subsequent suit the plaintiff contended that he had been forcibly dispossessed sometime in the second week of June 1968 contrary to law even though his tenancy was subsisting and he had paid the first installment of rent for the year 1968.
Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that no court shall try any suit or issue in which the matter directly and substantially in issue in a former suit between the same parties or between parties under whom they or any of them claim litigating under the same title in a court competent to try such subsequent suit or the suit in which such issue has been subsequently raised and has been heard and finally decided by such court .
It is not the finding of the High Court that in the previous suit the question regarding the tenancy of the plaintiff was determined against the plaintiff.
As the record stands the only ground on which the previous suit 1022 was dismissed was the technical ground that a suit for a mere declaration cannot lie without claiming possession once it is found that the plaintiff had lost possession.
The first suit was dismissed on the technical ground that since the plaintiff was not in de facto possession no injunction could be granted and a suit for a mere declaration of status without seeking the consequential relief for possession could not lie.
