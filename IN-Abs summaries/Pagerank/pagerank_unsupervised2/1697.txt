The appellant then moved the Tribunal to refer a certain question to the High Court at Madras under section 661 of the Act but that application was rejected.
Obviously the succession indicated must have been after April 1 1939 as we have earlier stated for a person carrying on a business on that date can only be succeeded in that business by another person on a date later than it.
It contends that it had been carrying on a business on April 1 1939 from before and on that business tax had been charged under the Act of 1918 and that it was succeeded by a company as owner of the business as a result of a transfer by an instrument executed on February 7 1948.
On the last mentioned date it carried on business in piece goods yarn and other articles at Calicut with branches in Madras and Bombay.
On January 2 1934 the remaining four partners executed an instrument varying some of the terms of the agreement of December 6 1918.
20 All the partners hereby agree that they in their individual capacity are and shall be Partners also along with Hemchand Veerjee Sait in a Partnership business in Soaps and Umbrellas carried on in Calicut and Madras under the name and style of Sait Nagjee Purushotham and Co Soap and Umbrella Merchants and in Bombay under the name and style of Shah Nagjee Purushotham  Co the terms and conditions whereof are embodied in an Agreement of Partnership dated 30 5 1939 signed by all the Partners.
