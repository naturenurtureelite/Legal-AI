It is also the case of the appellant that the said fusel oilStyrene Monomer manufac tured by it is sold in bulk and delivered to the customers at the appellant s factory.
The appellant had filed its price lists in respect of the same.

On 2nd July 1983 a notice in respect of a consignment was issued to show cause as to why value of the drums should not be included in the value of the goods.
There the drums had been supplied by the buyer.
Replies were duly filed to the said show cause notices by the appellant contending inter alia that as the drums were supplied by the buyer value thereof could not be included in the assessable value.
The Assistant Collector included the value of the drums in the assessable value of the said fusel oilStyrene Monomer.

Collector.
It was contended that in any event under the Act and the Rules the duty of excise is payable by the manufacturer on the manufactured goods.
The said sub section does not contemplate accord ing to the appellant the inclusion of the cost of packing in the value of goods when the packing is supplied by a customer to a manufacturer on its own cost.
Learned Attorney General emphasised that it is a well settled principle of construction that in taxing statutes one has only to look merely at what is clearly stated.
There is no presump tion as to tax.
The Asstt.
Collector in those appeals had included the costs of such drums in the value of styrene monomer.
Relying on the two decisions referred to hereinbe fore learned Attorney General emphasised that percentages of sales would not in any manner affect determination of the assessable value of the excisable goods.
According to the learned Attorney General the fact that 90 of the goods were supplied in tankers and not in containers had no relevance at all and the 10 represent ed the entire quantity of excisable goods delivered in packed condition.
