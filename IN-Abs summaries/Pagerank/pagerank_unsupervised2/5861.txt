It is said that it would be violative of the Constitutional right of equal pay for equal work.
They will be found correctly stated in the judgment under appeal and may briefly be stated thus Prior to 1965 in the High Court of Allahabad Bench Secretaries were on a higher pay scale than that of Section Officers.
The State Government accepted the recommendations.
Section Officers have to prepare a lengthy and original notes in complicated and important matters.
Therefore the responsibilities of the two posts cannot be said to be equal.
the pay scale recommended by the Pay Rationalisation Committee the nature of duties and responsibilities and the fact that every Hon ble Judge will have one Private Secretary in the scale of Rs500 1000 we feel that the Bench Secretaries cannot be given the same scale of pay which is being given to Superintendents or the Section Officers.
SL Appeal allowed.
