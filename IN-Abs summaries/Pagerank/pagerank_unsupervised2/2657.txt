Applications by respondent No 1 for revocation of the certificate granted by the Madras High Court on 15th October 1968 under article 1331a  b of the Constitution of India.
MK Ramamurthi Shyamala Pappu and Vineet Kumar for respondent No 1.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Shah J.
Ramamurthi J by order dated April 12 1968 granted an interim injunction restraining encashment of the letters of credit pending disposal of the suit.
In appeals under the Letters Patent preferred by the second defendant.
the High Court of Madras set aside that order.
The High Court observed that an order granting interim injunction is a final order as far as this Court is concerned determining the rights of parties within this lit or proceeding which is independent though ancillary to the suit and they were competent to grant the certificate.
By our order dated October 28 1968 we ordered that the certificate granted by the High Court do stand revoked.
That is a matter not in dispute.
The expression judgment in article 133  1  in the context in which it occurs means a final adjudication by the Court of the rights of the parties and that an interlocutory judgment even if it decides an issue or issues without finally determining the rights and liabilities of the parties is not a judgment however cardinal the issue may be.
The expression final order it has been held by a long course of authorities occurring in section 205 of the Government of India Act 1935 section 109 of the Code of Civil Procedure and article 1331 of the Constitution means a final decision on the rights of the parties in dispute in a suit or proceeding if the rights of the parties in dispute in the suit or proceeding remain to be tried after the order the order is not final.
The trial court decided the issue against the appellant and the order was confirmed in appeal by the High Court of Bombay.
