N C Chatterjee Janaradan Sharma K B Rohtagi and section Balakrishnan for the appellant in CA No 931 of 1965 and the respondent in C A No 1149 of 1965.
DN Mukherjee for the respondent in CA No 931 of 1965 and the appellant in CA No 1149 of 1965.
Sudhir is admittedly a member of a Scheduled Caste.
He challenges the validity of the order of the High Court setting aside his election.
In the election petition the respondent had stated that the appellant was a member of the Saha caste and not a member of any Schedule Caste.
He held that the Sahas formed a group within the Sunri caste be it a sub caste strictly so called or other 390 wise.
The learned Judge therefore held that as the appellant bore the surname Saha he did not belong to the Scheduled Caste specified in item 40 though he was a Sunri.
There is no doubt that Sunri is a caste.
It is natural to think that if the excluded Sahas were those Sunris who bore the surname Saha the Order would have made that clear.
