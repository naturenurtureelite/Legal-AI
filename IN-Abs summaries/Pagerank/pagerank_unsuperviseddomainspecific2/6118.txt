Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India.
The petitioners are carpenters 1st and 2nd grade employed at the Wood Working Centre of the Himachal Pradesh State Handicrafts Corporation the Corpo ration.
In this petition under Article 32 of the Constitution they are seeking enforcement of their fundamental right to have equal pay for equal work.
The Corporation has resisted the petitioners  claim.
They are given bonus under the Bonus Act and provident fund benefits under the Employees  Provident Fund Act.
The Corporation has clearly stated that there are no regular employees of the petitioners  categories in its establishment and as such the question of payment to the petitioners the pay admissible to regular employees does not arise.
The Corporation is a company which has been incorporated under the .
During the period of training the trainees are paid a stipend by the Corporation.
Apart from giving training the Corporation also ensures marketing support to the artisans and craftsmen by purchasing their products at remunerative prices and sell them through the marketing network of the Corporation.
It is thus a service oriented organisation helping the village artisans and craftsmen to produce and market their products on remunerative prices.
It is said that the village artisans and craftsmen make different items on a piece rate basis and in some cases they execute the work in their own homes.
The Court held that the principle of equal pay for equal work has no mechanical application in every case of similar work.
But the Court held that the principle of equal pay for equal work cannot be invoked invariably in every kind of service particularly in the area of professional services.
Evidently the petitioners are claiming wages payable to the carpenters in Government service.
They cannot claim wages payable to their counterparts in government service.
