Thereafter a host of writ petitions 122 were filed in this Court under Article 32 of the Constitu tion challenging the constitutional validity of section 15 on the ground that it infringed Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution.
Finding no reasonable classifi cation it struck down 124 clauses first  secondly  and thirdly  of section 151a clauses first  secondly  and thirdly  of section 151b and clause first  secondly  and third ly  of section 151c and the entire section 152 as ultra vires the Constitution.
Since this Court found certain intrinsic contradictions in the list of relatives covered by the first three clauses it saw no justification for the classification contained in the said provision conferring a right based on consanguinity and therefore struck down those clausesas discriminatory and violative of Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution.
At the same time it upheld the right conferred on co sharers for reasons stated earlier.
This Court never intended to exclude any speci fied co owners from the scope of clause fourthly of section 151b of the Act.
Once conferment of the right of pre emption in favour of co sharers was considered to be a reasonable restriction on the right to hold acquire and dispose of property under Article 191 f the same re striction was held to be valid when tested on the touchstone of Articles 14 or 15 of the Constitution.
