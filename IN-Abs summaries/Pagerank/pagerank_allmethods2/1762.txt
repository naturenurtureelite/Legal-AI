Appeals from the judgment and decree dated May 2 1960 of the Rajasthan High Court in Civil Second Appeal Nos.
268 of 1954 203 of 1955 4 of 1954 and 27 of 1954.
These four appeals arise out of four certi ficates granted by the High Court of Rajasthan and raise a common question.
The respondent was a resident of the former Dholpur State and the dispute which led to the suit related to a time before the merger of former Dholpur State into the Matsya Union.
The respondent however was not able to export the entire quantity of 15000 maunds for which the permit was granted he could only export 4572 maunds and 20 seers of chuni before December 2 1947.
It was alleged on behalf of the respondent that the reason why he failed to export the entire 176 quantity of the commodity before December 2 1947 was due to market conditions and inability to get allotment of railway wagons.
By May 15 1949 the United State of Rajasthan was formed including the Matsya Union into which the former State of Dholpur had merged on March 17 1948.
The United State of Rajasthan eventually became the Part B State of Rajasthan on January 26 1950 when the Constitution came into force.
In reply to this contention of the State the respondent relied on article 2952 of the Constitution and other provisions made during the period when mergers were taking place after August 15 1947 and contended that in view of article 2952 of the Constitution the State of Rajasthan was bound by the obligation of the former State of Dholpur.
In March 1949 the United State of Rajasthan was formed by Covenant entered into by fourteen Rulers of Rajasthan including these who had formed the Former State of Rajasthan.
