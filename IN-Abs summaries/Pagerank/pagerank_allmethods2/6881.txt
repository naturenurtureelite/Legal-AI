The Judgment of the Court was delivered by AHMADI J.
Thereafter a host of writ petitions 122 were filed in this Court under Article 32 of the Constitu tion challenging the constitutional validity of section 15 on the ground that it infringed Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution.
This Court therefore upheld the constitutional validity of clause fourthly of section 151a clauses fourthly  and fifthly  of section 151b and clause fourthly of section 151c as valid and not infringing Articles 14 or 15 of the Constitution This Court however did not find any justification for the classification contained m section 15 which conferred a right of pre emption on the kinsfolk.
It also found the list of kinsfolk entitled to pre emption as intrinsically defec tive and Self contradictory.
Finding no reasonable classifi cation it struck down 124 clauses first  secondly  and thirdly  of section 151a clauses first  secondly  and thirdly  of section 151b and clause first  secondly  and third ly  of section 151c and the entire section 152 as ultra vires the Constitution.
In Atam Prakash s case this Court therefore held that what was said about the right of pre emption granted to co sharers in relation to Article 1911 of the Constitution applied with equal force to justify the classification in relation to Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution.
