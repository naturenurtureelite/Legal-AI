section K Venkataranga Iyengar and K Keshava Iyengar for the appellant.
November 13.
This appeal arises from a suit brought by the appellant in the court of the Subordinate Judge Mysore as the sole executor of the will alleged to have been executed by one Lakshmamma on August 22 1945 exhibit A.
Respondents 2 to 4 are the sons of the appellant.
Both of them are dead.
Alternatively it was alleged by the appellant that even if survivorship did not apply and so her son Narayana lyengar acquired interest to half the share in the properties covered by the gift deed he had during his lifetime sold away considerable properties of his father and mother much above the value of his half share and in consequence the remaining properties which represent Lakshmamma s half share became her absolute properties.
Against this decree respondent I preferred an appeal in the High Court of Mysore and the appellant filed cross objections.
2  157 159.
In this case the evidence about the instructions given by the testator was very clear and there was not the slightest reason for disbelieving the statement of Gooneratne that he had drawn the will faithfully in accordance with the details of instructions given to him.
On appeal by a majority  decision the order of the trial court was reversed.
Appeal dismissed.
