The first and the main point argued with regard to wages was that the Tribunal after holding that there was no identical industry in this region comparable with the Company came to.
It was also urged in the alternative that even in adopting the latter course the Tribunal committed an error inasmuch as in making the calculation the Tribunal only tried to neutralise about 36 per cent of the cost of living 9n the basis of the rise in Price Index instead 669 of permitting neutralisation to the extent of at least 90 which could have been done when fixing the minimum wages for the owest class of workmen.
The principle for fixation of minimum wages that should ordinarily be adopted was laid down by this Court in the case of French Motor Car Co Limited.
vs Workmen1 where it was held  It is now well settled that the principle of industry cum region has to be applied by an Industrial Court when it proceeds to consider questions like wage structure dearness allowance and similar conditions of service.
On these facts the Tribunal held that it would not be proper to compare the wage structure for these Paper Mills with that of the Company.
On this finding it is clear that the region cure industry principle laid down in the ease of French Motor Car Co Ltd 1 could not have been applied by the Tribunal when fixing the wages in the Company.
Though therefore in a case where a particular concern is already paying the highest wages in its own line of business the industrial courts would be justified in looking at wages paid in that region in other lines of business it should take care to see that the concerns from other lines of business taken into account are such as are as nearly similar as possible to the line of business carried on by the concern before it.
In fact the Tribunal also accepted them as being comparable and that is why in its conclusion the Tribunal held that in its opinion it would be appropriate under the circumstances of the case to fix the minimum wage in the Company on the basis of the minimum wage prevailing in other industries in that region.
Having come to this view it is clear that to give full effect to the principle laid down by this Court the case of French Motor Car Co1 the Tribunal should have proceeded to fix the minimum wage in the Company on the basis of the average minimum wage prevailing in these concerns.
