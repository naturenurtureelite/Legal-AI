Admittedly no general body meeting had been held and therefore the balance sheet and profit and loss account had not been laid before a general body meeting nor could it be so laid.
view that a person charged with an offence cannot rely on his default as an answer to the charge and so if he was responsible for not calling the general meeting he cannot be heard to say in defence to the charges brought against him that because the general meeting had not been called the balance sheet and profit and loss account could not be laid before it.
After referring to the decisions in Gibson vs Barlon2 Edmonds vs Foster3 and Park vs Lawton4 where it was held that a person charged with an offence could not rely on his own default as an answer to the charge and so if the person charged was responsible for not calling the general meeting he cannot be heard to say in defence to the charge that the general meeting had not been called and that the company and its officers were bound to perform the condition precedent if they could do that in order that they might perform their duty this Court considered that as the correct view to take.
But section 134 lays down that after balance sheet and profit and loss account or the income and expenditure account as the case may be have been laid before the company at the general meeting three copies thereof shall be filed with the registrar and a failure to do so is made punishable under sub section 4 of that section.
The appeal is dismissed.
VPS Appeal dismissed.
