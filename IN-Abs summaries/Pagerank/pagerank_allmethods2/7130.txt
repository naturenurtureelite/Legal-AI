Taneja for the Respondents.
Feeling aggrieved by the order of dismissal of the appeal the defendants preferred separate Second Appeals Nos.
The High Court therefore held that the decree passed by the Civil Court was unsustainable.
It is against this order of the High Court that the present appeal by special leave is preferred.
That suit was for a declaration that the plaintiff was a lessee and for an injunction to restrain the defendants from interfering with his possession of the suit property.
The foundation for that suit was that the plaintiff who claimed to be a lessee in respect of the demised property apprehended his forcible dispossession therefrom.
With a view to preventing any such action on the part of the defendants he instituted the suit for an injunction to restrain them from so doing.
That suit however came to be dismissed as the Trial Court came to the conclusion that the plaintiff was no more in possession of the property in respect of which he claimed to be a lessee.
It was only thereafter that the plaintiff filed the suit for restoration of his possession.
In the subsequent suit the plaintiff contended that he had been forcibly dispossessed sometime in the second week of June 1968 contrary to law even though his tenancy was subsisting and he had paid the first installment of rent for the year 1968.
Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that no court shall try any suit or issue in which the matter directly and substantially in issue in a former suit between the same parties or between parties under whom they or any of them claim litigating under the same title in a court competent to try such subsequent suit or the suit in which such issue has been subsequently raised and has been heard and finally decided by such court .
Rule 2 thereof requires that the plaintiff shall include the whole of his claim in the framing of the suit.
