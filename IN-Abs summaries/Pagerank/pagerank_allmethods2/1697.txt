The appellant then moved the Tribunal to refer a certain question to the High Court at Madras under section 661 of the Act but that application was rejected.
The present appeals are from the judgment of the High Court.
The facts have to be stated at some length but before we do that we think it would be profitable to set out the statutory provisions concerned.
Though we are directly concerned with sub sec.
4 of section 25 a consideration of subsec.
The second condition of the applicability of section 254 is that business must have been carried on at the commencement of the Indian Income tax Act Amendment Act 1939 that is April 1 1939 by the person claiming the relief.
Obviously the succession indicated must have been after April 1 1939 as we have earlier stated for a person carrying on a business on that date can only be succeeded in that business by another person on a date later than it.
This condition of course is applicable only where as in the present case the business was carried on by a firm.
It contends that it had been carrying on a business on April 1 1939 from before and on that business tax had been charged under the Act of 1918 and that it was succeeded by a company as owner of the business as a result of a transfer by an instrument executed on February 7 1948.
It is on this basis that it claimed the benefit of section 25 4 of the Act.
It appears that a firm bearing the same name as that of the appellant that is Sait or Shah Nagjee Purshotham and Company was started in 1902 and was reconstituted by an agreement of partnership dated December 6 1918.
On January 2 1934 the remaining four partners executed an instrument varying some of the terms of the agreement of December 6 1918.
