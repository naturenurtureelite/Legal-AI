M C Setalvad and R C Prasad for the appellants.
The respondent did not appear.
March 24 1964.
The terms in question need not be express and can be implied but they must be terms which arise out of the contract of employment and since an award made by an Industrial Tribunal cannot be said to amount to a contract of employment the wage structure prescribed by the award cannot fall within the definition prescribed by section 2vi.
That in brief is the substance of the argument raised by the appellant.
The true legal position is that when industrial disputes are decided by industrial adjudication and awards are made the said awards supplant contractual terms in respect of matters covered by them and are substituted for them.
In our opinion the Bombay view correctly represents the true legal position in the matter.
There would be no order as to costs.
