His wife who was the second accused in the case was charged with aiding and abetting her husband in the commission of the two offences.
He asked for a certificate under article 1341c of the Constitution but this was rejected on 10 4 1950.
 It was urged that the offence arises only on receipt of any sum or any consideration as a condition of the relin quishment by a tenant of his tenancy and that in the present case there was no such relinquishment.
Exhibit D which is the most material document under which the appellant handed over vacant possession of the flat to the complainant constitutes or evidences an assignment of the tenancy and not a relinquishment.
It says  I WH King hereby hand over vacant possession of my flat No 3 situated on 2nd floor and garage No 4 on the ground floor of Ganga Vihar Building on Plot No 55 situated on Marine Drive Road to Mr Mulchand Kodumal Bhatia from this day onward and that I have no claim whatsoever over this flat and Mr Mulchand Kodumal Bhatia will pay the rent directly to the landlord.
It is the landlord s consent to the transfer of a lease by sub lease or otherwise on receipt of consideration that has been made an offence.
If by the expression an assignment such as we have in the present case was meant appropriate words could have been used such as the transfer by a tenant of his interest which we find in section 108 sub clause i of the Trans fer of Property Act.
In the case of an assignment the assignor contin ues to be liable to the landlord for the performance of his obligations under the tenancy and this liability is contrac tual while the assignee becomes liable by reason of privity of estate.
In fact a surrender or relinquishment terminates the lessee s rights and lets in the lessor.
It is no doubt true that the word relinquishment does not occur in the Transfer of Property Act but it is found in many of the Tenancy Acts in various provinces where there are Sec tions which deal with the 55 424 relinquishment of their holdings by tenants in favour of the landlord by notice given to him in writing.
The section in question it should be further noted does not speak of relinquishment or giving up of possessionin general terms.
The words are the relinquishment of his tenancy of any premises.
Whether abandonment of a tenancy would come within the meaning of relinquishment is a question that does not arise in this appeal because in the face of Exhibit D there is no abandonment in the sense that the tenant disappeared from the scene altogether saying nothing and making no arrange ments about his interest and possession under the lease.
The other parts of the order of the learned Presidency Magistrate as regards the disposal of Rs 1000 paid by the complainant to the appellant and the sum of Rs 29500 brought in by the police will however stand.
