Tax Reference Cases Nos 3 to 5 of 1975 Tax Reference under Section 257 of the Income tax Act 1961 made by the Income tax Appellate Tribunal Cuttack Bench Cuttack PA Francis Champat Rai and Miss A Subhashini for the Appellant.
CSS Rao for the Respondent.
The figure of net wealth of the assessee at the end of the previous year takes into account the financial activities of the assessee during that previous year.
His financial activities during that period determine how his net wealth on a particular valuation date differs from his net wealth on the immediately preceding valuation date.
There is an obvious advantage in adopting as the valuation date the last day of a period which is also the relevant period under the Income Tax Act.
There is clear indication that the assets to be considered are not circumscribed by any consideration of the particular system of accounting adopted by the assessee.
The assets are not confined to cash.
In other words it would be the estimated open market value of the rights in the property which constitute the asset.
There is no order as to costs.
