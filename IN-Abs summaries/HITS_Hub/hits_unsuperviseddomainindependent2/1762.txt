Appeals from the judgment and decree dated May 2 1960 of the Rajasthan High Court in Civil Second Appeal Nos.
The respondent however was not able to export the entire quantity of 15000 maunds for which the permit was granted he could only export 4572 maunds and 20 seers of chuni before December 2 1947.
By May 15 1949 the United State of Rajasthan was formed including the Matsya Union into which the former State of Dholpur had merged on March 17 1948.
The United State of Rajasthan eventually became the Part B State of Rajasthan on January 26 1950 when the Constitution came into force.
As the United State of Raja sthan into which the former State of Dholpur came to be merged in 1949 never recognised the obligations of the former State of Dholpur it was not bound to refund the amount due to the respondents.
In reply to this contention of the State the respondent relied on article 2952 of the Constitution and other provisions made during the period when mergers were taking place after August 15 1947 and contended that in view of article 2952 of the Constitution the State of Rajasthan was bound by the obligation of the former State of Dholpur.
It is not in dispute that on this merger provision was made for the continuance of the laws in the covenanting State till such time as they were modified by the new State.
