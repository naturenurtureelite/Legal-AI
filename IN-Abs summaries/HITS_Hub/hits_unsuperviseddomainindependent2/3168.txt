Admittedly no general body meeting had been held and therefore the balance sheet and profit and loss account had not been laid before a general body meeting nor could it be so laid.
In that case the directors of a company were prosecuted under sections 325 and 1333 of the Companies Act 1913 for breaches of sections 32 and 131 of that Act for having knowingly and wilfully authorized the failure to file the summary of share capital for the year 1953 and being knowingly and wilfully parties to the failure to lay before the company in general meeting the balance sheet and profit and loss account as at March 31 1953.
The Bombay High Court however following its earlier decision in Imperator vs The Pioneer Clay and Industrial Works Ltd1 had upheld the acquittal of the directors by the Presidency Magistrate.
After referring to the decisions in Gibson vs Barlon2 Edmonds vs Foster3 and Park vs Lawton4 where it was held that a person charged with an offence could not rely on his own default as an answer to the charge and so if the person charged was responsible for not calling the general meeting he cannot be heard to say in defence to the charge that the general meeting had not been called and that the company and its officers were bound to perform the condition precedent if they could do that in order that they might perform their duty this Court considered that as the correct view to take.
