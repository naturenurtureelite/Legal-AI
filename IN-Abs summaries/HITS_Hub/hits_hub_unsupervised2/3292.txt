The appellant brought the suit on the allegation that there was one Shiromani Nirankari Dera at Patiala that this institution had two branches one at Landeke in Moga Tehsil and the other at Nanga Kheri in the erstwhile Patiala State and that he as mahant in charge of the Shiromani Dera at Patiala had the right to manage the properties attached to the Dera at Landeke.
The trial court decreed the suit.
Against that decree an appeal was preferred by the appellant to the High Court.
While the appeal was pending in the High Court Som Dass the defendant died on 13 10 1970.
No application was made by the appellant to bring on record his legal representatives within the period prescribed.
The trial Court after taking evidence found that Som Dass died on 13 10 1970.
Thereafter the appellant prayed before the High Court that his application dated 1 2 1971 might be treated as an application for setting aside the abatement of the appeal and the ground for setting aside the abatement was that the appellant did not know about the death of Som Dass at the time he died.
