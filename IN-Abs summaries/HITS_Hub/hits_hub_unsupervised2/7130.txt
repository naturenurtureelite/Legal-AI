Lastly it noticed that during the pendency of the suit the Goa Daman  Diu Agricultural Tenancy Act 1964 hereinafter called the Act  was amended by Act 17 of 1976 dated October 141976 known as the Fifth Amendment which was brought into effect from April 20 1976 by which the definition of agriculture  was changed and the expressions garden  and garden produce  were defined by the insertion of sub sections 7A.
It is against this order of the High Court that the present appeal by special leave is preferred.
The foundation for that suit was that the plaintiff who claimed to be a lessee in respect of the demised property apprehended his forcible dispossession therefrom.
That suit however came to be dismissed as the Trial Court came to the conclusion that the plaintiff was no more in possession of the property in respect of which he claimed to be a lessee.
It was only thereafter that the plaintiff filed the suit for restoration of his possession.
Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that no court shall try any suit or issue in which the matter directly and substantially in issue in a former suit between the same parties or between parties under whom they or any of them claim litigating under the same title in a court competent to try such subsequent suit or the suit in which such issue has been subsequently raised and has been heard and finally decided by such court .
It is not the finding of the High Court that in the previous suit the question regarding the tenancy of the plaintiff was determined against the plaintiff.
As the record stands the only ground on which the previous suit 1022 was dismissed was the technical ground that a suit for a mere declaration cannot lie without claiming possession once it is found that the plaintiff had lost possession.
