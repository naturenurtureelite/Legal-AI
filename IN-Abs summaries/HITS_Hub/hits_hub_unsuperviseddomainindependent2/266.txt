The principal question canvassed in this case is whether certain sections of the Taxation on Income Investigation Commission Act 1947 ie Act XXX of 1947 have become void from the date of the commencement of the Constitution of India by reason of article 14 of the  Constitution.
On the 12th April 1954 the present petition under article 32 of the Constitution was filed for the issue of appropriate writs restraining the Commission from taking any action against the petitioner under the provisions of Act XXX of 1947 on the ground that the provisions of sections 51 5467 and 8 of Act XXX of 1947 had become void being discriminatory in character after the coming into force of the Constitution of India.
In order to appreciate the respective contentions raised and canvassed before us on behalf of the petitioner company and the State it is necessary to set out some of the relevant provisions of the Act.
As regards sub section 4 of section 5 the learned counsel contended that this section had no independent existence and was bound to fall with subsection 1 Of section 5 if his contention regarding the invalidity of that section prevailed.
This was a class by itself and needed special treatment and there fore the law did not offend against the equal protection of the laws clause of the Constitution.
