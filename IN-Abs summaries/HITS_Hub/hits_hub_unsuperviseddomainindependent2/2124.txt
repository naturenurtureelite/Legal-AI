il Appeal Nos 931 and 1149 of 1965.
Appeals from the judgment and decree dated July 31 1964 of the Calcutta High Court in Appeal from Original Decree No 613 of 1962.
N C Chatterjee Janaradan Sharma K B Rohtagi and section Balakrishnan for the appellant in CA No 931 of 1965 and the respondent in C A No 1149 of 1965.
DN Mukherjee for the respondent in CA No 931 of 1965 and the appellant in CA No 1149 of 1965.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Sarkar CJ.
These appeals arise out of an election to a seat in the West Bengal Legislative Assembly from the Khargram Murshidabad constitutency reserved for members of the Scheduled Castes.
The contestants at this election were Abhoy Pada Saha and Sudhir Kumar Mondal.
Sudhir is admittedly a member of a Scheduled Caste.
At the hearing of the petition by the Election Tribunal however he challenged the election only on the ground that Abhoy Pada was a member of the Saha caste and not a member of a Scheduled Caste.
The Election Tribunal rejected this contention and dismissed the petition.
These two appeals are from the judgment of the High Court.
