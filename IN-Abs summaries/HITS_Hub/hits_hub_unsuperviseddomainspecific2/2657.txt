 The suit filed by the plaintiffs is a civil proceeding and the suit involves some claim or question respecting property of not less than twenty thousand rupees.
That is a matter not in dispute.
The expression judgment in article 133  1  in the context in which it occurs means a final adjudication by the Court of the rights of the parties and that an interlocutory judgment even if it decides an issue or issues without finally determining the rights and liabilities of the parties is not a judgment however cardinal the issue may be.
In the present case not even an issue has been decided and it is not contended that the order of the High Court amounts to a judgment or a decree.
The expression final order it has been held by a long course of authorities occurring in section 205 of the Government of India Act 1935 section 109 of the Code of Civil Procedure and article 1331 of the Constitution means a final decision on the rights of the parties in dispute in a suit or proceeding if the rights of the parties in dispute in the suit or proceeding remain to be tried after the order the order is not final.
The orders now under appeal do not finally dispose of those rights but leave them to be determined by the Courts in the ordinary way.
In Abdul Rahman s case1 a suit was instituted by DK Cassim and Sons claiming damages against the appellant Abdul Rahman.
The trial court decided the issue against the appellant and the order was confirmed in appeal by the High Court of Bombay.
