The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Hidayatullah J.
This is an appeal by special leave against an award dated September 20 1963 made by the Presiding Officer of the Central Government Industrial Tribunal Bombay in a reference made by the Government of India under section 102 of the .
The appellants are the workmen of the Bombay Port Trust who are and have been represented in this dispute by the Bombay Port Trust Employees  Union.
The respondents to this appeal are the trustees of the Port of Bombay.
The reference was made on a joint application of the parties.
and the matter in dispute was stated to be  Whether the existing system of work of the shore crew of the Prince s and Victoria Docks under which each shift consists of 8 hours  normal duty 2 hours  variable recess and 12 hours  overtime needs any modification The Tribunal by the award impugned here held that the Union was not able to establish that the existing system of work needed any modification.
The Port Trust had under its control several docks.
Reference in this judgment will be made to the Prince s and Victoria Docks the Alexandra Docks Butcher Island and the Flotilla Crew.
These represent different areas of work where different groups of workmen were employed.
From the facts appearing on the record it appears that the Trustees first introduced a two shift system of work in the Alexandra Docks on June 30 1953 and the same system was extended to the Prince s and Victoria Docks on December 15 1953.
Previously the shore crew at all these places worked in a single shift and were liable to be called out at 634 any hour of the day or night.
When the two shift system began each shift of 12 hours was broken up into 8 hours  duty 2 hours  variable recess and 2 hours  overtime.
The hours of rest were kept variable as they depended on the tides.
In 1956 the workmen who were then represented by the Port Trust General Workers  Union made a demand for a fixed recess of two hours.
The Trustees apprehended that this was a device to get 4 hours  overtime and rejected the demand.
The General Workers Union was informed that if the demand was pressed a three shift system would be introduced.
The workmen then retraced their steps and accepted a 2 hours  variable recess but requested that it should be as near the middle of the shift as possible.
The Trustees agreed to accept the hours of rest at fixed hours in the Alexandra Docks but at the Prince s and Victoria Docks they kept it variable agreeing to fix it as near the middle of the duty hours as possible.
In explanation of this difference it may be pointed out that the Alexandra Docks work on a system of lock gates which enables the depth of water at the docks to be artificially regulated but the Prince s and Victoria Docks being tidal work only at high tide.
The workmen at the Alexandra Docks seemed to have accepted a variable recess of two hours but the Port Trust gave a notice under section 9A of the on June 25 1960 announcing the introduction of variable recess although in the months other than the monsoon months recess was actually at fixed hours.
They contended that regard being had to the number of actual work hours the case of shore crew at the Prince s and Victoria Docks and the Butcher Island could not be compared with that of the crew at the Alexandra Docks or the Flotilla Crew.
He has in addition submitted that the system of variable recess does not satisfy the requirements of rest which is the basis for fixing statutorily the hours of work in relation to wages.
The was enacted to enable Government to fix minimum rates of wages in certain employments.
Since fixation of minimum wages must take into account the work load also provision must not only be made for prescribing the minimum wage but to correlate it to a specified amount of work.
We are concerned with two sections and two rules.
 Rule 24.
3 Nothing in this rule shall be deemed to affect the provisions of the  The controversy in the present case is a narrow one.
That is done by the Rules.
Section 13 only authorises Government to fix the number of hours which shall constitute a normal working day inclusive of on .
or more specified intervals.
It means a break in the work during which a workman though present on duty is not called upon to display either physical activity or sustained attention.
Sub rule 2 then lays down that the working day of an adult shall be so arranged that inclusive of intervals for rest it shall not spread over more than twelve hours on any day.
The distinction between intervals of rest and hours of work is thus made clear.
A working day may extend to 12 hours but the number of hours of work cannot exceed 9.
This determines what is a normal working day and what is meant by an interval of rest.
The section so read lays down  Where an employee   works on any day in excess of 9 hours the employer shall pay him for every hour or for part of an hour so worked in excess at the overtime rate    Under Rule 25 1 b this overtime rate is double the ordinary rate of wages.
These provisions are subject to 641 one more check which we may now mention.
He may go up to 9 hours on any day without paying any overtime provided he does not exceed 48 hours in the week.
If he takes work during the extra 4 hours or fails to specify the hours of rest he must pay overtime.
Overtime under section 14 is only payable when the workman works in excess of the number of hours constituting a normal working day.
2    56.
The only difference is that a worker must not be made to work for more than 5 hours at a stretch before he has had an interval for rest of half an hour at the least.
According to their resolution the recess is fixed as near the middle of the work as possible depending on the tides.
