At the hearing of the petition by the Election Tribunal however he challenged the election only on the ground that Abhoy Pada was a member of the Saha caste and not a member of a Scheduled Caste.
In the election petition the respondent had stated that the appellant was a member of the Saha caste and not a member of any Schedule Caste.
The Tribunal rejected the respondent s case that the Sunri caste was divided into certain groups of which the Sahas formed one.
The learned Judges of the High Court thought that the effect of the item was to exclude from the Sunri caste those who belonged to that caste but bore the surname Saha.
Nobody disputes that.
The error of the Tribunal lay in interpreting the Order in the light of the evidence before it.
If the correct interpretation of item 40 was as we think it was that Sahas were a caste group within the Sunri caste no question of Sahas being a distinct class independent of Sunris could arise.
