2788 and 3188 which came to be allowed on April 5 1991.
The lite is also the same.
Therefore the subsequent suit was based on a distinct cause of action not found in the former suit and hence we do not think that the High Court was right in concluding that the suit was barred by Order 2 Rule 23 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
If the defendant who is sued as a trespasser raises a plea of tenancy a question arises whether his plea of tenancy can be decided by the Civil Court as incidental to the grant of relief for possession or is the Civil Court precluded from deciding the same in view of section 7 read section 582 of the Act.
We are therefore of the opinion that it would be just and fair that the issue whether defendant No1 was a tenant in respect of the lands in question should be referred to the Mamlatdar for decision and after his decision is received by the Civil Court if the issue is held against defendant No1 the Civil Court may consider passing of a decree in eviction but if on the other hand he is held to be tenant the Civil Court may be required to dismiss the suit.
But in the case of a deemed tenant who has been evicted from the land on or after 1st July 1962 since a remedy has been provided under 1032 the Act the Jurisdiction of the Civil Courts stands wholly barred by virtue of Section 58 2 of the Act.
His remedy would therefore to be entirely under the Act.
We would like to make it clear that the hypothetical situations may or may not apply to the fact situation that may emanate of the pleadings in this case and it would be for the Trial Court to determine the course of action to be adopted in the light of the guidelines indicated hereinabove.
