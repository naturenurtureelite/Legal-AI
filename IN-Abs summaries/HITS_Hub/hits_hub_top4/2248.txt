B R Agarwala and section B Nerkar for respondent No 1.
A K Sen A section Bobde G L Sanghi and O C Mathur for respondent No 2.
In order to appreciate the points raised before us it is necessary to give the relevant facts and statutory provisions.
Procedure for levying tax or fee.
Fixing of octroi limits and nakas.
A Panchayat shall with the approval of the Collector or of any officer authorised by the Collector not below the rank of Mamlatdar Tehsildar Naib Tehsildar or Mahalkari fix octroi limits and the number and location of octroi Nakas within 219 the limits of its jurisdiction.
Payment of octroi on introduction of goods etc.
 Rules 30 31 32 and 33 deal with refund of octroi.
We may first deal with the question of the validity of the levy of octroi duty.
It seems to us that the octroi duty has been levied in accordance with law.
It would be noticed that the rule which authorises the levy is r22 but it enjoins that the procedure prescribed in rr3 and 4 should be followed before the octroi duty can be levied.
When we turn to rr3 and 4 it would be noticed that these rules prescribe the procedure for levying tax or fee and are not confined to octroi duty only.
Under r3d what the panchayat does is to consider objections and suggestions and then finally make the choice as regards two things ie the tax or fee to be imposed and the rate at which it is to be levied.
