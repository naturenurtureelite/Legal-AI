Now proceed to record our reasons.
Sessions Case 26 of 1977 is stated to be an off shoot of what is known as the Manwath murders case  in which Prakash s father Uttamrao Barhate and his permanently kept concubine Rukmanibai and 13 others were tried for the murders of 10 girls and women during the period from 14111972 to 4 111974 in Manwath village Prabhani district Maharashtra State.
In 784 that case the charge under section 120B IPC was framed against four named persons who had been arrayed as accused 1 to 4.
The High Court acquitted accused 2 to 4 and convicted accused 1 alone of that charge and sentenced him holding that he and some others had conspired together and fabricated the deed of assignment put forward by accused 1 and that accused 1 alone could not have fabricated that document.
We are of the opinion that the retracted judicial confession of accused 5 could not be relied upon against accused 6 in this case in view of the fact that accused 6 who had been tried alongwith accused 5 had been acquitted by the High Court of the charge of conspiracy under section 302 read with section 120B IPC and accused 5 was not charged for the offence of murder of Malan for which only accused 1 6 and 7 were tried.
