The High Court has affirmed the finding of the authority and held that section 15 was applicable to the case because the wages prescribed by the award did amount to wages as defined by section 2vi of the Act.
The terms in question need not be express and can be implied but they must be terms which arise out of the contract of employment and since an award made by an Industrial Tribunal cannot be said to amount to a contract of employment the wage structure prescribed by the award cannot fall within the definition prescribed by section 2vi.
In dealing with the question of construing the unamended definition of the term wages it is essential to bear in mind the scope and character of the powers conferred on Industrial Tribunals when they deal with industrial disputes under the provisions of the Indus trial Disputes Act.
It is now well settled that unlike ordinary civil courts which are bound by the terms of contract between the parties when they deal with disputes arising between them in respect of the said terms Industrial adjudication is not bound to uphold the terms of contract between the employer and the employees.
In our opinion the Bombay view correctly represents the true legal position in the matter.
