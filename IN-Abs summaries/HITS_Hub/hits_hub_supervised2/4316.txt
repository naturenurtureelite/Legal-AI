There was no separate dearness allowance until January 1977 when it was introduced for the first time.
Nothing those facts the Tribunal observed that compared with the increased paying capacity of the appellant an inference drawn from the prosperity enjoyed by the appellant over the years there was definite need for revising the wage scales.

And that is confirmed by what was stated in paragraph 23 of the award Considering this outgoing the flat increase of Rs 150 in the category of Draughtsman and Rs 100 in the case of the other categories would be fair.
No second flat increase was envisaged at all.
The amendment made by the Tribunal has the effect of providing a second increase this time to each individual workmen.
Even when considering the range of permissible retrospectivity the Tribunal stated in the award In view of the revision of the wage scales there would be consequent increase in the dearness allowance and the house rent allowance.
The statement afforded an indication merely of what the additional financial load would be if a flat increase was given to the individual workman on the alternative basis set forth therein.
None of the alternatives was actually adopted by the Tribunal because when the award was made the Tribunal proceeded instead to restructure the wage scales by the addition of Rs 150 in the case of the category of Draughtsmen and Rs 100 in the case of other categories to the initial pay in the wage scales pertaining to those categories.
The addition was integrated as a feature of the wage scales it was not regarded as an addition to the pay of each individual workman.
The second contention of the appellant is entitled to succeed.
The only contention of the workmen is that the Tribunal should have fixed the dearness allowance in communion with the cost of living index.
There is no order as to costs.
CHINNAPPA REDDY J We have had the advantage of perusing the judgment prepared by our learned brother Pathak J we agree with 180 him that Civil Appeal No 2300 of 1979 should be dismissed.
However we do not agree with our learned brother that Civil Appeal No 2299 of 1979 should be allowed in so far as it relates to the order dated December 22 1978 of the Industrial Tribunal which purports to correct the award dated December 20 1978.
In the said award Your Honour has observed at the end of Para 22 In view of the increase that is being allowed in the basic pay I do not propose to revise the existing scheme of Dearness Allowance .
Similarly the same words to each employee after the figure 100 were omitted.
Even so we propose to examine whether the correction sought by the employees union was within the bounds of the authority of the Tribunal or whether it was in effect a fresh award.
Implicit and intrinsically connected with the question of revision of the wage scales were the questions of fitment of employees into the wage scales and flat or ad hoc increase of salaries of workmen wherever considered necessary.
Nor can it be doubted that fitment into the revised pay scales is certainly a part of the revision of pay scales.
The question is what should be the extent of such burden At the end of paragraph 18 of the award the Tribunal said A mere reading of Exhibit U 15 will immediately dispel the misgivings about the future of the present company.
For some years to come this is likely to be one of the few Consulting Engineers who will be securing major contracts.
Finally at the end of paragraph 21 the Tribunal said  In view of this position the Company can easily bear some burden that might fall as a result of the upward revision of the wage scales.
While workmen raising industrial disputes for revision of wage scales are certainly minded about their future prospects in the matter of wages they surely would be more concerned with the immediate benefits according to them That was why the Industrial Tribunal thought that an all round flat increase of Rs 150 in the case of Draftsmen and Rs 100 in the case of other workmen was called for.
Since there was to be a flat increase of Rs 150 and Rs 100 in the case of draftsmen and other workmen respectively the revised wage scale had necessarily to commence with figures Rs 150 and Rs 100 above the existing wage scales.
