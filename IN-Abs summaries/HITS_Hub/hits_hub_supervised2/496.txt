Appeals by Special Leave granted by Supreme Court on the 18th January 1954 from the Judgment and Order dated the 18th June 1953 of the High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad in Confirmation Case No 3766 of 1952 53 and Criminal Appeals Nos3946 3956 and 3926 of 1952 53 arising out of the Judgment and Order dated the 2nd June 1952 of the Court of the Sessions Judge at Bidar in Sessions Case No 98 of 1951 52.
J B Dadachanji and Rajinder Narain for the appellant.
The other two have not appealed.
Rasika Bai shouted out to the assailants not to beat Ramchander but they threatened her and then ran away.
There are four eye witnesses and the main question we have to consider is whether they can be believed.
Subhana does not say that the other two struck any particular blow.
It is to be noted that the SubInspector does not say that Tukaram brought the report to him but that exhibit 4 the report received from the Police Patel states that Tukaram gave the Police Patel the information.
That leaves the matter equivocal but in view of what the Police Patel tells us we think that he did mean to convey that 1089 Tukaram was the complainant probably because he did not want to enter a woman s name and so picked on the nearest male relative.
What is certain is that there was no point in sending off a report without names the next morning if the idea of delay was to concoct a story and implicate innocent persons.
Moreover the whole village probably turned out as soon as the news spread in any case the witnesses are agreed that there was a large crowd there.
The remaiding four are described as blue and black marks.
So the part they played was negligible.
People do not ordinarily act in unison like a Greek chorus and quite apart from dishonesty this is a favourite device with witnesses who are either not mentally alert or are mentally lazy and are given to loose thinking.
In a case like that each would be individually liable for whatever injury he caused but none could be vicariously convicted for the act of any of the others and if the prosecution cannot prove that his separate blow was a fatal one he cannot be convicted of the murder however clearly an intention to kill could be proved in his case Barendra Kumar Ghosh vs King Emperor2 and Mahbub Shah vs King Emperor1.

Pandurang is accordingly only liable for what he actually did.
