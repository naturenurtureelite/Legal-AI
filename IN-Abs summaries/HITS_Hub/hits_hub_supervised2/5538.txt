The period of leave and licence was to commence from 1st of September 1965 to 31st of August 1970 and it was further submitted that the licensee and the licensor shall not terminate the said agreement earlier save and except on the ground of breach of any of the terms and conditions written therein.
It is further stipulated that the licensee would be entitled to keep the keys of the said premises with him and shall be at liberty to work in the said premises for twenty hours subject to restriction of rules and regulations imposed by the Municipal or any other local authority or authorities.
It is further stipulated that the licensee shall pay the electric charges in respect of consumption of electricity and the rent of the said premises should be paid by the licensor only.
It is interesting to note that in the judgment of the Small Cause Court and also of the High Court at several places the expression BC was used this is intriguing as we find that it intrigued Vaidya J because he stated in his judgment dated 9th of December 1975 what the expression BC was meant by Court.
He recorded further that he thought that BC meant by consent .
The learned Judge recorded further that it was practice in the Court of Small Causes Bombay of using the expression 1063 BC.
We could not agree more.
In July 1967 the appellants 1064 filed an application for eviction under section 41 of the .
If he was such a licensee the non obstante clause of section 15A1 give him the status and protection of a tenant in spite of there being anything to the contrary in any other law or in contract.
It was futher held that a person continuing in occupation of such premises after revocation of the licence was still liable to pay compensation or damages for its use and occupation.
It was observed that the finding of the High Court that the respondent was in occupation of the premises under a subsisting licence was wholly wrong and suffered from serious infirmities of law and fact and deserved to be set aside.
The High Court disallowed the special civil application under Article 227 of the Constitution on 17th of November 1980 and that is the judgment impugned in this appeal.
To put precisely if an interest in immovable property entitling the transferee to enjoyment was created it was a lease if permission to use land without exclusive possession was alone granted a licence was the legal result.
we are of the opinion that this was a licence and not a lease as we discover the intent.
For this purpose reference may be made to the language used and the restrictions put upon the use of the premises in question by the appellant.
Restriction in the hours of work negates the case for a lease.
It was a possible view.
This is a salutary test.
This Court in Venkatlal G Pittie  Anr.
The appeal fails and is dismissed.
