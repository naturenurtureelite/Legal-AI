section K Venkataranga Iyengar and K Keshava Iyengar for the appellant.
Both of them are dead.
Jaya was married to Kalbagal Junior.
429 Respondents 2 to 5 have not appeared in the proceedings.
According to her the gift deed exhibit D did not provide for devolution of interest by survivorship she pleaded that Lakshmamma had transferred all her interests in the properties comprised in the gift deed in favour of her husband Sadagopalachar who then became their sole owner.
Against this decree respondent I preferred an appeal in the High Court of Mysore and the appellant filed cross objections.
In confirming the view of the High Court the Privy Council made the observations to which we have just referred.
In conclusion their Lordships differed from the view of the appeal court that there had been a complete failure of the proof that the deed poll correctly represented the intentions of the testator or that he understood or approved of its contents and so they thought that there were no grounds for excluding from the probate the passages in the will which referred to that deed.
Consistently with this new version the appellant has added in his evidence that when he met her at Mandya during her illness she reminded him that she had asked him to make a will for quite some time and she insisted that the draft should be prepared without any delay.
