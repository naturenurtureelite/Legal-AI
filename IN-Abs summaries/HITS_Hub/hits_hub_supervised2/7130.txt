Taneja for the Respondents.
Feeling aggrieved by the order of dismissal of the appeal the defendants preferred separate Second Appeals Nos.
The High Court therefore held that the decree passed by the Civil Court was unsustainable.
The first ground on which the High Court dismissed the suit is that the suit was barred by the principle of res judicata in view of the dismissal of the former suit No 15768.
The lite is also the same.
The relief is only a consequence.
Rule 2 thereof requires that the plaintiff shall include the whole of his claim in the framing of the suit.
Ever where a tenant apprehends that his possession is likely to be interfered with contrary to the provisions of the Act he can make an application in the prescribed manner to the Mamlatdar for safeguarding the same.
So also where a tenant is evicted illegally section 82 permits him to approach the Mamlatdar for recovery of possession.
However during the pendency of the suit a notification was issued under section 6 of the Bombay Rents Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act 1947 hereinafter called the Rent Act  applying Part II of the Act to areas where the property in question was situate.
However the Act does not preclude the institution of a suit by a tenant for restoration of possession from a trespasser.
Section 82 has limited operation where a person referred to in section 4 has been evicted on or after 1st July 1962.
But in the case of a deemed tenant who has been evicted from the land on or after 1st July 1962 since a remedy has been provided under 1032 the Act the Jurisdiction of the Civil Courts stands wholly barred by virtue of Section 58 2 of the Act.
In such a situation the Civil Court would not be competent to pass any order for restoration of possession to the deemed tenant.
