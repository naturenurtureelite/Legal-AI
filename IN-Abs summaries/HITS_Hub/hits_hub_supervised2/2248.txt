M N Phadke and Naunit Lal for the appellant.
B R Agarwala and section B Nerkar for respondent No 1.
A K Sen A section Bobde G L Sanghi and O C Mathur for respondent No 2.

In order to appreciate the points raised before us it is necessary to give the relevant facts and statutory provisions.
Fixing of octroi limits and nakas.
A Panchayat shall with the approval of the Collector or of any officer authorised by the Collector not below the rank of Mamlatdar Tehsildar Naib Tehsildar or Mahalkari fix octroi limits and the number and location of octroi Nakas within 219 the limits of its jurisdiction.
 Rules 30 31 32 and 33 deal with refund of octroi.
It seems to us that the octroi duty has been levied in accordance with law.
It would be noticed that the rule which authorises the levy is r22 but it enjoins that the procedure prescribed in rr3 and 4 should be followed before the octroi duty can be levied.
The inhabitants of the village would be entitled to object only to these two matters namely 1 the tax or fee imposed and the rate at which it is levied.
Under r3d what the panchayat does is to consider objections and suggestions and then finally make the choice as regards two things ie the tax or fee to be imposed and the rate at which it is to be levied.
Accordingly.
