 10  per day and that led to the present claim made by the respondents under section 15 of the Act.
In regard to the question of limitation the authority did not decide the said question as a preliminary question because it held and in our opinion rightly that it was a mixed question of fact and law and so it had to be tried after recording evidence.
It is this order which the appellant seeks to challenge before us by its present appeal by special leave.
The terms in question need not be express and can be implied but they must be terms which arise out of the contract of employment and since an award made by an Industrial Tribunal cannot be said to amount to a contract of employment the wage structure prescribed by the award cannot fall within the definition prescribed by section 2vi.
We are not inclined to hold that even under the unamended definition of wages rates of remuneration prescribed by an award could not be included.
In a sense the latter wage structure must be deemed to be a contract between the parties because that in substance is the effect of industrial adjudication.
In Jogendra Nath 1 AIR 1964 SC 15.
In our opinion the Bombay view correctly represents the true legal position in the matter.
