Appeal No 251 of 1963.
M C Setalvad and R C Prasad for the appellants.
The respondent did not appear.
March 24 1964.
The subsequent amendment expressly provides by section 2vi a that any remuneration payable under any award or settlement between the parties or order of a Court would be included in the main definition under section 2vi.
This agreement was subsequently published in the Bihar Gazette as a part of the award.
In spite of the award and the agreement the appellant paid its employees only As.
The respondents contended before the payment of wages authority that the refusal of the appellant to pay to them wages at the rate awarded in substance amounted to an illegal deduction from their wages and on that basis they asked for an order from the authority directing the appellant to pay to the respondents the said prescribed wages.
The appellant raised two pleas against the respondents  claim.
421 The authority has found that section 2vi includes wages prescribed by the Industrial Tribunal and so it has rejected the appellants  contention that the applications made by the respondents were incompetent under section 15 of the Act.
On that view the writ petition filed by the appellant was dismissed.
It is this order which the appellant seeks to challenge before us by its present appeal by special leave.
