Appeals by special leave from the judgment and order dated  March 6 1967 of the Orissa High Court in OJC Nos.
495 and 496 of 1966 and 3 4 27 and 28 of 1967 respectively.
CK Daphtary Attorney General NS Bindra G Rath and RN Sachthey for the appellant in all the appeals.
The power to appoint the secretaries to the government is that of the Governor.
In Orissa as in most of the other States that practice continued till the decision of tiffs Court in the State of Assam vs Ranga Mahammad and others1.
Obviously when the Governor promulgated the Orissa Superior Judicial Service Rules 1963 he proceeded on the basis that the power to transfer the district judges and addl.
district judges from one post to another whether as a judge or to one of the posts in the secretariat was in his hands.
It appears that for some time past there were differences between the High Court and the government about the posting of some of the judicial officers.
The High Court insisted that ordinarily judicial officers should not hold those posts for more than three years.
On that account there appears to have been some friction between the High Court and the gov ernment for some years past.
Thereafter he was posted as superintendent and legal remembrancer.
In February 1965 the High Court took a policy decision to the effect that as a general rule judicial officers working in special posts whether cadre or non cadre outside their regular line should be recalled to the regular line after the completion of three years.
On September 21 1966 this Court rendered its decision in Ranga Mahammad s1 case.
Therefore these appeals were filed after obtaining special leave from this Court.
It was not the case of the contesting respondents that Shri PC Dey Shri KK Bose and Shri BK Patro had not the necessary qualifications to hold the posts they were holding.
It was also not disputed that they had been validly appointed to those posts.
In these circumstances we fail to see how the High Court could have held that they had no authority to hold the posts in question.
As mentioned earlier member sales tax tribunal was an ex cadre post.
