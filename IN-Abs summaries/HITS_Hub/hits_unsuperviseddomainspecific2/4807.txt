any other law for the time being in force.
In pursuance of this power the appellant was appointed as a clerk on June 1 1963 by the Panchayat Samiti Loharu which is respondent 3 in this appeal.
He was confirmed in that post in course of time.
On January 21 1974 he was promoted as a Head Clerk on an ad hoc basis.
On April 1 1975 the appellant was appointed as a Head Clerk.
A plain consequence of this deletion was that the Panchayat Samitis were divested of their power to make appointments to the Panchayats.
Sections 351 of the Act empowers the State Government to place at the disposal of a Panchayat Samiti such of its servants as are required for the implementation of the schemes connected therewith and for such other duties and functions as may be assigned to them by the Panchayat Samiti from time to time.
Acting in pursuance of the provision of section 144 of the Amending Act the Government of Haryana notified the absorption of the appellant as a clerk though as stated earlier he was working as a head Clerk in the Loharu Panchayat Samiti.
Being aggrieved by his absorption on a lower post he filed a writ petition in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana asking that he should be absorbed as a Head Clerk.
The writ petition having been dismissed by the High Court the appellant has filed this appeal by special leave.
There will be no order as to costs.
