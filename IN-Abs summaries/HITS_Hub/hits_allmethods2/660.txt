Both of them are dead.
429 Respondents 2 to 5 have not appeared in the proceedings.
According to her the gift deed exhibit D did not provide for devolution of interest by survivorship she pleaded that Lakshmamma had transferred all her interests in the properties comprised in the gift deed in favour of her husband Sadagopalachar who then became their sole owner.
Against this decree respondent I preferred an appeal in the High Court of Mysore and the appellant filed cross objections.
The High Court thought that the learned trial judge had not fully considered all the material bearing on this point and so was in error in holding that at the relevant date Lakshmamma had a subsisting interest in half the share even in the suit properties items 1 and 2.
In confirming the view of the High Court the Privy Council made the observations to which we have just referred.
Consistently with this new version the appellant has added in his evidence that when he met her at Mandya during her illness she reminded him that she had asked him to make a will for quite some time and she insisted that the draft should be prepared without any delay.
In our opinion the evidence given by the appellant on this point is clearly an after thought and his story that he had received previous instructions cannot be accepted as true.
