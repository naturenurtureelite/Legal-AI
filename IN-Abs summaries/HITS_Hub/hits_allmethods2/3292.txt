This is an appeal by special leave against a decree passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana holding that the appeal filed by the plaintiff appellant has abated and dismissing his suit.
The prayer in the plaint was for recovery of possession of the Dera and the properties attached to it.
The trial court decreed the suit.
Against that decree an appeal was preferred by the appellant to the High Court.
While the appeal was pending in the High Court Som Dass the defendant died on 13 10 1970.
No application was made by the appellant to bring on record his legal representatives within the period prescribed.
The correctness of the date of death of Som Dass was contested by Shiam Dass.
The trial Court after taking evidence found that Som Dass died on 13 10 1970.
Thereafter the appellant prayed before the High Court that his application dated 1 2 1971 might be treated as an application for setting aside the abatement of the appeal and the ground for setting aside the abatement was that the appellant did not know about the death of Som Dass at the time he died.
