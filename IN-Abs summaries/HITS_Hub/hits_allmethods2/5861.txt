The State Government accepted the recommendations.
They have claimed that their duties are equivalent to Private Secretaries of Hon ble Judges and have demanded the same pay scale which is given to Private Secretaries and the Section Officers.
Section Officers have to prepare a lengthy and original notes in complicated and important matters.
Therefore the responsibilities of the two posts cannot be said to be equal.
the pay scale recommended by the Pay Rationalisation Committee the nature of duties and responsibilities and the fact that every Hon ble Judge will have one Private Secretary in the scale of Rs500 1000 we feel that the Bench Secretaries cannot be given the same scale of pay which is being given to Superintendents or the Section Officers.
Section Officers have to bear more responsibilities in their Sections.
SL Appeal allowed.
