Appeal No 1375 of 1966.
M N Phadke and Naunit Lal for the appellant.
B R Agarwala and section B Nerkar for respondent No 1.
M section K Sastri R N Sachthey section P Nayar for R H Dhebar for respondent No 3.
The appellant had in this petition prayed for the issue of a writ quashing the resolution dated April 6 1964 passed by the Standing Committee Zila Parishad Nagpur and for a writ of mandamus directing the Standing Committee not to interfere with the right of the appellant to impose and collect the octroi duty pursuant to its resolution dated February 25 1963.
In order to appreciate the points raised before us it is necessary to give the relevant facts and statutory provisions.
A Panchayat shall with the approval of the Collector or of any officer authorised by the Collector not below the rank of Mamlatdar Tehsildar Naib Tehsildar or Mahalkari fix octroi limits and the number and location of octroi Nakas within 219 the limits of its jurisdiction.
Payment of octroi on introduction of goods etc.
 Rules 30 31 32 and 33 deal with refund of octroi.
When we turn to rr3 and 4 it would be noticed that these rules prescribe the procedure for levying tax or fee and are not confined to octroi duty only.
The inhabitants of the village would be entitled to object only to these two matters namely 1 the tax or fee imposed and the rate at which it is levied.
Under r3d what the panchayat does is to consider objections and suggestions and then finally make the choice as regards two things ie the tax or fee to be imposed and the rate at which it is to be levied.
Accordingly.
