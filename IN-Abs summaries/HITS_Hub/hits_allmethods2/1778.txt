The respondent did not appear.
This question has to be answered in the light of the definition prescribed by section 2vi before it was amended in 1958.
The subsequent amendment expressly provides by section 2vi a that any remuneration payable under any award or settlement between the parties or order of a Court would be included in the main definition under section 2vi.
The point which we have to decide in the present appeal is whether the remuneration payable under an award was not already included in the definition of wages before the said definition was amended.
In spite of the award and the agreement the appellant paid its employees only As.
 10  per day and that led to the present claim made by the respondents under section 15 of the Act.
The respondents contended before the payment of wages authority that the refusal of the appellant to pay to them wages at the rate awarded in substance amounted to an illegal deduction from their wages and on that basis they asked for an order from the authority directing the appellant to pay to the respondents the said prescribed wages.
421 The authority has found that section 2vi includes wages prescribed by the Industrial Tribunal and so it has rejected the appellants  contention that the applications made by the respondents were incompetent under section 15 of the Act.
