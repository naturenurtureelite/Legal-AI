On October 9 1964 he was appointed as a Radiologist in the Irwin Hospital which was a post in Category C  of the Central Health Service.
However the University College of Medical Sciences which is under the administrative control of the University of Delhi has been utilising the services of the Medical officers of the CHS working in the Safdarjang Hospital New Delhi for clinical teaching of the students of the University College of Medical Sciences.
In the vacancy caused thereby Dr Shinghal who was Specialist in Ophthalmology attached to the Willindon Hospital was offered the post of Chief Opthalmologist cum Associate Professor of Ophthalmology Medical College Simla.
It is necessary to emphasise that the recruitment rules nowhere provide that the teaching experience gained by a Specialist in a teaching hospital in the capacity of an Associate Professor ex officio shall not count towards the requisite teaching experience.
There is a failure on the part of the Ministry of Health to draw a distinction between teaching and non teaching hospitals under the Central Health Service.
The two general hospitals under the Central Health Service are the Willingdon Hospital  Nursing Home New Delhi and the Safdarjang Hospital New Delhi.
