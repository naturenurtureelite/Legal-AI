Civil Appeal No 159 of 1974.
From the Judgment and Order dated 4 4 1973 of the Punjab and Haryana High Court at Chandigarh in RSA No 1482 of 1961.
488 N N Goswamy and Arvind Minocha for the appellant.
Kapil Sibbal and D Probir Mitra for respondents.
The trial court decreed the suit.
Against that decree an appeal was preferred by the appellant to the High Court.
While the appeal was pending in the High Court Som Dass the defendant died on 13 10 1970.
No application was made by the appellant to bring on record his legal representatives within the period prescribed.
An application was made on 1 2 1971 by the appellant stating that Som Dass died on 26 11 1970 leaving behind him Shiam Dass as his Chela and for impleading him.
The High Court referred the question to the trial Court for enquiry and decision.
The High Court found no substance in the plea that the appellant had no knowledge about the date of the death of Som Dass and held that the appeal had abated and that there was no ground for setting aside the abatement.
We see no force in this argument.
VPS Appeal allowed.
