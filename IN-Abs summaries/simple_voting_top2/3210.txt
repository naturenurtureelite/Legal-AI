Whether the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry New Delhi Respondent 1 is a commercial establishment within the meaning of s25 of the Delhi Shops and Establishments Act 1954 for short the Act is the sale question that falls for determination in this appeal by certificate directed against the judgment dated February 8 1967 of the High Court of Delhi.
Before the High Court the contention of the Federation was that the premises in which the registered office of the Federation is located is not a commercial establishment within the meaning of section 25 of the Act which in consequence had no application.
 352 It was then contended that the activities of the Federation carried on in the premises in question amounted to work in connection with or incidental or ancillary to trade or business in general within the latter part of the definition of commercial establishment.
They read Commercial establishment means any premises wherein any trade business or profession or any work in connection with or incidental or ancillary thereto is carried on and includes a society registered under the  and charitable or other trust whether registered or not which carries on any business trade or profession or work in connection with or incidental or ancillary thereto  journalistic and printing establishments quarries and mines not governed by the  educational or other Institutions run for private gain and premises in which business of banking insurance stocks and shares brokerage or produce exchange is carried on but does not include a shop or a factory registered under the  or theaters cinemas restaurants eating houses residential hotels clubs or other places of public amusement or entertainment.
 It will be seen that while the definition of establishment includes a shop  and commercial establishment the definitions of shop  and commercial establishment  are mutually exclusive.
It came up for consideration before this Court in Management of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry vs Their workman Shri R K Mittal1 After considering its Memorandum of Association Articles of Association and other material which was more or less the same as in the present case it was held by this Court that the activity of this Federation is in the nature of a business or trade.
Mr Pai learned Counsel for the Federation has firstly raised a preliminary objection that before the High Court at no stage it was urged on behalf of the Appellants that the activity of the Federation carried on in the premises was a business or trade.
