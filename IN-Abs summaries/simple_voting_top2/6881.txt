Appeal No 4366 of 1991.
This Court therefore upheld the constitutional validity of clause fourthly of section 151a clauses fourthly  and fifthly  of section 151b and clause fourthly of section 151c as valid and not infringing Articles 14 or 15 of the Constitution This Court however did not find any justification for the classification contained m section 15 which conferred a right of pre emption on the kinsfolk.
In that case also this Court held that the right of pre emption vested in co shar ers was a reasonable restriction on the right to hold acquire or dispose of property conferred by Article 1911 of the Constitution.
Where the sale is of a share out of joint land or property and is not made by all the co sharers jointly only the other co sharers and the tenants can exercise the right of pre emption.
Under the Punjab Pre emption Act 1905 the corresponding provision section 12 con ferred a right of pre emption in the case of a sale of a share of such land or properly held jointly firstly in the lineal discendents of the vendor in male line in order of succession secondly in the co sharers if any who are agnates in order of succession thirdly in the persons described in sub clause a ie in persons who but for such sale would be entitled to inherit the properly in the event of his or their decease in order of succession and fourth ly in the co sharers jointly or severally.
We therefore do not approve the ratio of Jagdish s case and overrule the same.
