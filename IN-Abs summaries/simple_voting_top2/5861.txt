Writ Petition No 4211 of 1983.
It is said that it would be violative of the Constitutional right of equal pay for equal work.
The Committee was asked to consider the duties and responsibilities of different categories of posts.
The Committee recommended for them a pay scale slightly lower than that of Section Officers.
The State Government accepted the recommendations.
They demanded that they should at least be put at par with Section Officers if not on higher scale.
It is not necessary to emphasise that in comparison to Bench Secretaries the Section Officers of the secretariat has to bear more responsibilities in their Section and have to control over its subordinates.
Section Officers have to prepare a lengthy and original notes in complicated and important matters.
Therefore the responsibilities of the two posts cannot be said to be equal.
The Commission therefore recommended Rs400 750 for Bench Secretaries and Rs500 1000 to Section Officers.
It is pertinent to all such cases.
