Appeal No 1375 of 1966.
 The Company thereupon filed an appeal before the Standing Committee Zila Parishad Nagpur hereinafter referred to as the Standing Committee on October 22 1963.
The learned counsel for the appellant contends before us 1 that r 5 of the Fees Rules was intraviress 2 that the Standing Committee had no jurisdiction to decide the appeal on merits as the appeal to the Panchayat Samiti was barred by limitation 3 that the octroi duty has been levied in accordance with law 4 that at any rate the levy was good after the octroi limits were fixed on January 14 1964 5 that the approval of the octroi limits on January 14 1964 relates back to April 1 1963 and 6 that the tea was imported into the Panchayat limits for consumption use or sale.
Before we deal with these points it is necessary to set out the relevant statutory provisions.
Procedure for levying tax or fee.
3 and 4.
It only deals with two items 1 selection of the tax and the rate at which it is to be levied.
But the learned counsel for the Company Mr Ashok Sen argues that this interpretation is not correct because para 2 of r4 says that the tax shall accordingly be levied from the date which shall be specified in the notice and he says that if the octroi limits had not been approved of by the time the resolution is passed how could the tax be levied from the date specified in the notice.
But r4 has to be read alongwith r21 and if so read it would mean that before the octroi duty can start being levied r21 must be complied with.
We are unable to allow him to raise this point at this stage.
He says that this point was raised before the High Court but it has not been 221 A dealt with by it.
