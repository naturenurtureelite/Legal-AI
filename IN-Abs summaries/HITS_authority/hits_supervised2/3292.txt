Against that decree an appeal was preferred by the appellant to the High Court.
An application was made on 1 2 1971 by the appellant stating that Som Dass died on 26 11 1970 leaving behind him Shiam Dass as his Chela and for impleading him.
Thereafter the appellant prayed before the High Court that his application dated 1 2 1971 might be treated as an application for setting aside the abatement of the appeal and the ground for setting aside the abatement was that the appellant did not know about the death of Som Dass at the time he died.
When Som Dass died the interest which was the subject matter of the suit devolved upon Shiam Das as he was elected to be the Mahant of the Dera and the appeal could be continued under Q 22 r 10 of the Civil Procedure Code against the person upon whom the interest had devolved.
We see no force in this argument.
The subject matter of the suit was the interest of Som Dass in the Dera and its properties and it devolved upon shiam Dass by virtue of his election as mahant subsequent to the death of Som Dass.
