Similarly Karnataka High Court in Alembic Glass Industries vs Union of India  Ors supra held that the term value defined in section 44di provides for exclusion of cost of packing materi al which was of durable nature and was returnable by the buyer to the assessee.
The use of the expression cost could not obviously be by way of reference to packing for which the cost is incurred by the buyer.

Chief Justice Bhag wati on the other hand held that corrugated fibreboard containers in which the cigarettes were contained fell within the definition of packing  in the Explanation to section 44di and if these formed part of the packing in which the goods were packed when delivered at the time of removal then under section 44di read with the Expla nation the cost of such corrugated fibreboard containers would be liable to be included in the value of cigarettes.

In 10 of the sales the vehicle of removal was drums.
