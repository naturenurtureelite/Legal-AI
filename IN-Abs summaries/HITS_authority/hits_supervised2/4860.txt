Now proceed to record our reasons.
The Sessions Judge found on a consideration of the evidence all the seven accused not guilty of the charge of conspiracy framed under section 302 read with section 120B IPC and acquitted them.
The High Court considered the evidence and dismissed Criminal Appeal 38 of 1977 filed by the State for enhancement of the sentence of imprisonment for life awarded to accused 1 and 6 for the murder of Malan as also Criminal Appeal 7 of 1977 filed by accused 1 and 6 against their conviction and the sentence awarded to them.
Therefore his conviction and sentence awarded to him have become final.
It is the case of the prosecution that Shivram PW 45 saw accused 6 under a vad tree and Abasaheb PW 44 saw him in the rivulet and 4 retracted judicial confession Exh 138 of accused 6.
We are of the opinion that the retracted judicial confession of accused 5 could not be relied upon against accused 6 in this case in view of the fact that accused 6 who had been tried alongwith accused 5 had been acquitted by the High Court of the charge of conspiracy under section 302 read with section 120B IPC and accused 5 was not charged for the offence of murder of Malan for which only accused 1 6 and 7 were tried.
