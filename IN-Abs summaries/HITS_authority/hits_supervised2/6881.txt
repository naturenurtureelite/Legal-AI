It also found the list of kinsfolk entitled to pre emption as intrinsically defec tive and Self contradictory.
Finding no reasonable classifi cation it struck down 124 clauses first  secondly  and thirdly  of section 151a clauses first  secondly  and thirdly  of section 151b and clause first  secondly  and third ly  of section 151c and the entire section 152 as ultra vires the Constitution.
In Atam Prakash s case this Court therefore held that what was said about the right of pre emption granted to co sharers in relation to Article 1911 of the Constitution applied with equal force to justify the classification in relation to Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution.
The 1905 Act was repealed and replaced by the 1913 Act.
This Court never intended to exclude any speci fied co owners from the scope of clause fourthly of section 151b of the Act.
We find it diffi cult to hold that the purport of the of Court s decision in Attam Prakash s case was to deny the right of pre emption to those relative or relatives of the vendor or vendors who were specified in the erstwhile first three clauses of section 151b even if they happen to be co sharers.
If the preceding clauses were not erased from the statute book as unconstitu tional the kinsfolk would have exercised the right in the order of preference for which no justification was found.
