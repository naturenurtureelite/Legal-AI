This Court therefore upheld the constitutional validity of clause fourthly of section 151a clauses fourthly  and fifthly  of section 151b and clause fourthly of section 151c as valid and not infringing Articles 14 or 15 of the Constitution This Court however did not find any justification for the classification contained m section 15 which conferred a right of pre emption on the kinsfolk.
In that case also this Court held that the right of pre emption vested in co shar ers was a reasonable restriction on the right to hold acquire or dispose of property conferred by Article 1911 of the Constitution.
