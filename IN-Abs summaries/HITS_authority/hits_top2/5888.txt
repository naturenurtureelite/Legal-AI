The letter dated 25th March 1988 states as follows The Collector of the district after perusal of the said office note passed order on 25388 which is produced in verbatim below Ist bidder chunki defaulter hai atah security prapt kar len tatha bhavishya ke liae Black list karen.
In so far as the contention that there is no requirement specifically of giving any notice is concerned the respondent is right.
But it is an implied principle of the rule of law that any order having civil consequence should be passed only after following the PG NO 869 principles of natural justice.
In the premises that portion of the order directing that the appellant be placed in the black list in respect of future contracts under the Collector is set aside.
This order will however not prevent the State Government or the appropriate authorities from taking any future steps for blacklisting the appellant if the Government is so entitled to do so in accordance with law ie giving the appellant due notice and an opportunity of making representation.
The appeal is thus disposed of.
