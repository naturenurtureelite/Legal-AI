Appeals by special leave from the judgment and order dated  March 6 1967 of the Orissa High Court in OJC Nos.
In view of article 229 of the Constitution.
It appears that for some time past there were differences between the High Court and the government about the posting of some of the judicial officers.
As mentioned earlier member sales tax tribunal was an ex cadre post.
It is not the case of the parties that he was placed at the disposal of the government for any definite period.
Hence that part of the High Court s order is unassailable.
As seen earlier the cadre of the superior judicial service senior branch consisted of not only the posts of district and sessions judges and addl.
Neither the government nor the High Court could have posted any officer as the Registrar of the High Court as that post can be filled only by 160 the Chief Justice.
In Ranga Mahammad s case2 the point that arose for decision was as to who was the authority to transfer a district judge.
 Obviously relying on the observation of this Court that after a judicial officer is posted to the cadre it is for the High Court to effect his transfers the court below has come to the conclusion that as the posts of the law secretary deputy law secretary and superintendent and legal remembrancer are included in the cadre the High Court has the power to fill those posts by transfer of judicial officers.
In that cadre no officer holding any post under the government was included.
If there is no such agreement it is open to the government to send him back to his parent department at any time it pleases.
If only there is mutual understanding and appreciation of the difficulties of the one by the other there will be harmony.
But it was beyond the powers of the High Court to post Shri KB Panda as the law secretary Shri T Misra as superintendent and legal remembrancer and Shri PK Mohanti as the deputy law secretary.
RKPS Appeals allowed in part.
