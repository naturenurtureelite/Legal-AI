On these facts the Tribunal held that it would not be proper to compare the wage structure for these Paper Mills with that of the Company.
 On the basis of this finding of fact the Tribunal held that if the minimum wage in the Company is to be fixed more on the basis of the minimum wage prevailing in other industries in that region which in its opinion would be appropriate under the circumstances of the case then a revision was really necessary.
Having come to this view it is clear that to give full effect to the principle laid down by this Court the case of French Motor Car Co1 the Tribunal should have proceeded to fix the minimum wage in the Company on the basis of the average minimum wage prevailing in these concerns.
Finally it was argued that other amenities being provided by the Company should also be taken into account when fixing the minimum wage.
Comparing with them there is justification for fixing the total wage packet of the workmen in the Company at Rs 95 which would include production bonus.
Consequently we are unable to hold that the Tribunal has committed any error and that in this respect any interference by us is called for.
It appears that the Tribunal did not accept this demand primarily on the ground that the distinction between casual workers and  the permanent workers was recognised by both the parties in the agreement of 1959.
In all these circumstances we think that the revised wages should take effect from 13th December 1962.
Since in this appeal the principal dispute related to the fixation of minimum wage of the workmen and we are allowing the appeal of the workmen in that respect we direct that the workmen will be entitled to their costs of this appeal from the Company.
