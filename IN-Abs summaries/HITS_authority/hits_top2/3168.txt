Admittedly no general body meeting had been held and therefore the balance sheet and profit and loss account had not been laid before a general body meeting nor could it be so laid.
4 5 6 7  J 92  8 AIR 413 High Court India Nutriments Ltd vs Registrar of Companies1 and PSNSA Chettiar  Company vs Registrar of Companies2 of the Madras High Court.
supra that a company or its directors in a prosecution under section 32 and section 133 of the 1913 Act could not in defence to such prosecution rely upon their own 415 failure to call the general body meeting applies with equal force to a prosecution under section 134 of the Act.
But section 134 lays down that after balance sheet and profit and loss account or the income and expenditure account as the case may be have been laid before the company at the general meeting three copies thereof shall be filed with the registrar and a failure to do so is made punishable under sub section 4 of that section.
A different offence might have been committed either under section 762 or under section 1333.
The observations which we have extracted earlier will show that the submission on behalf of the prosecution that provisions 1 IRL  2 1911 1 KE 417 of section 26 show that the obligation to file the list is independent of the holding of the general meeting was accepted.
The appeal is dismissed.
