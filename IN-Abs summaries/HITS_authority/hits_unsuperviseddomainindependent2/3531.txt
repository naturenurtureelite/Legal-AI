Appeal by Special Leave from the Award of the Industrial Tribunal Gujarat in Reference II No 30 of 1974 pub lished in the Gujarat Govt.
Gazette Part I L dated 15 4 76.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SHINGHAL J.
These two are companion appeals by special leave.
They have been heard together at the in stance.
of the learned counsel for the parties and will be disposed by a common judgment.
Speaking broadly the dispute in both cases related to the workmen s demand for 10 days sick leave with retrospective effect and its accumulation over a period of three years ie upto 30 days.
The workmen particularly felt aggrieved because by virtue of the first proviso to section 49 of the  hereinafter referred to as the Act they were not entitled to the sickness benefit for the first two days of sickness except in the case of a spell of sickness following at an interval of not more than 15 days the spell of sickness for which sickness benefit was last paid.
It was also a grievance that the benefit under the scheme of the Act was much less than the normal earnings of an employee and was not beneficial to the workmen.
The demand was resisted by the Companies in both cases.
In the case of the Alembic Glass Industries Ltd it was contended that the Act provided more than adequate sickness benefits and any additional 82 benefit would place unproductive financial burden on the industry and would have an all round adverse effect on other industries.
It was also urged that section 99 of the Act gave wide powers to the Employees  State Insurance Corpora tion to enhance the benefit and it was therefore the proper authority to examine the demand.
The Company also contended that there was no practice of giving any such sick leave in the industries in Baroda or in the State of Gujarat.
In the case of Jyoti Ltd an objection was taken that the reference was incompetent and the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to entertain it.
It was also pointed out that the benefit of sickleave of 7 days per year was initially given to the workmen under an award dated August 29 1958 which contained a specific direction that it would be automatically discon tinued when the benefits of the Employees  State Insurance scheme would become available to the workmen and also that the reasonableness of the demand could not be examined by the Tribunal.
An objection was also taken that the workmen had benefited a lot under the entire scheme of the Act and it would not be reasonable and proper to confer any addi tional benefit as the demands would place a heavy financial burden on the Company which it Could not bear.
The demand according to the Company would create an absurd position inasmuch as a worker would receive more wages by remaining absent than on duty.
The Company also pleaded that the demand for sickness leave could not be granted retrospec tively or allowed to accumulate.
It was stated before the Tribunal on behalf of the workmen of Jyoti Ltd that the arguments advanced and the contentions made in the case of the Alembic Glass industries may be considered as those made in their case also.
The award was on the lines of the earlier award in the case of the Alembic Glass Indus tries case except that the direction regarding 7 days sick leave was given retrospective effect from January 1 1975.
This is why these two have become companion appeals and are being disposed of together.
The controversy in these cases is whether the benefits admissible under the Act in the matter of the grant of sick leave are such as to justify the rejection of the workmen s demand and the setting aside of the Tribunal s awards in that respect.
It has been argued by the learned counsel for the appel lants that as the benefits of sections 47 and 49 of the Act are already admissible to workmen in Baroda with effect from December 14 1969 and they are quite adequate the Tribunal committed an error 83 of law in granting the additional benefits mentioned above.
Reference in this connection has been made to section 61 of the Act which provides that when a person is entitled to any of the benefits provided by the Act he shall not be enti tled to receive any similar benefit admissible under the provisions of any other enactment.
That this Act has been applied to the Company and that the workmen of the Company get the benefit of this Act is not disputed.
It is difficult to see however how the benefit that the workmen will get under this Act can affect the question of sickness leave being provided for the workmen.
It provides in section 461a for periodical treatment of any insured person in case of his sickness if certified by a duly appointed medical practitioner.
It is unnec essary to mention here the several provisions in the Act viz Sections 47 48 and 49 which deal with the eligibility of workmen for sickness benefit and the extent of the benefit that may be granted.
Section 56 of the Act pro vides for medical benefits to the insured workmen or in certain cases to the members of his family.
It appears to us clear however that in providing for periodical payments to an insured worker in case of sickness sickness benefit or for medical treatment or attendance to him or the members of his family the legislature did not intend to substitute any of these benefits for the workmen s right to get leave on full pay on the ground of sickness.
 The matter came up again for consideration by this Court in Technological Institute of Textiles vs Its Workmen and others2 and it was held as follows with specific reference to the first proviso to section 49 of the Act according to which a person qualified to claim sickness benefit is not enti tled to it for the initial waiting period of two days except in the case of continuous illness of the nature mentioned therein With regard to sick leave the argument on behalf of the appellant was that benefits were granted by the  but that is not a bar to the demand of the workmen for sick leave.
Section 61 of the Act cannot thus be said to be applicable for the simple reason that the benefits granted by the Tribunal are not similar to those admissible under the Act.
The other question regarding the adequacy of the sick ness benefit under the provisions of the Act has been exam ined by the Tribunal with reference to the reports of the National Commission of Labour 1969 the Labour Laws Review Committee and the Norms Committee of Gujarat State which go to show that the benefit cannot be said to be adequate for it works out to about half the average wage of a workman and even that amount is not admissible for the first two days of sickness except in the case of a spell of sickness following at an interval of not more than 15 days the spell of sickness for which the sickness benefit was last paid.
It has not been disputed before us that the region cure industry basis is suitable in cases like the present for examining any controversy regarding the work man s demand for additional benefits but it has been argued by the learned counsel for the appellants that the award of the benefit of sick leave to the workers of the two Compa nies could not be justified on that basis.
In fact in the 85 case of the Alembic Glass Industries Ltd Baroda the Tribunal made an award for 7 days sick leave on full pay and dearness allowance in 1958 subject to the condition that the benefit would cease to apply when the benefits of the Act became available to the workmen.
The appeals therefore fail and are dismissed except that the award in the case of Jyoti Ltd Baroda is made effective from the date of its commencement.
