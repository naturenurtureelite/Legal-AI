It also held that the suit was barred by res judicata as well as Order 2 Rule 23 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
Lastly it noticed that during the pendency of the suit the Goa Daman  Diu Agricultural Tenancy Act 1964 hereinafter called the Act  was amended by Act 17 of 1976 dated October 141976 known as the Fifth Amendment which was brought into effect from April 20 1976 by which the definition of agriculture  was changed and the expressions garden  and garden produce  were defined by the insertion of sub sections 7A.
On these findings the High Court allowed the appeals and 1021 reversed the decree of the Trial Court with no order as to costs.
It is against this order of the High Court that the present appeal by special leave is preferred.
The foundation for that suit was that the plaintiff who claimed to be a lessee in respect of the demised property apprehended his forcible dispossession therefrom.
That suit however came to be dismissed as the Trial Court came to the conclusion that the plaintiff was no more in possession of the property in respect of which he claimed to be a lessee.
As the record stands the only ground on which the previous suit 1022 was dismissed was the technical ground that a suit for a mere declaration cannot lie without claiming possession once it is found that the plaintiff had lost possession.
The High Court is therefore clearly wrong in its view that the relief claimed is neither relevant nor material.
