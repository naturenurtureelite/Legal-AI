Daulatram Rameshwarlal a firm registered under the Indian Partnership Act referred to later in this judgment as sellers  are registered dealers under section 11 of the Bombay Sales Tax Act.
The Sales Tax Officer rejected this claim for exemption and assessed them to sales tax on a taxable turnover including these sales.
The notice of demand for the total sales tax and the purchase tax assessed was served on the sellers on September 30 1956.
The learned Judge who heard the petition rejected the sellers  contention that the goods remained their property till these crossed the customs frontier and therefore held that the sellers were not entitled to the benefit of article 2861b of the Constitution.
Against this decision the sellers appealed.
The 927 learned Judges who heard the appeal held disagreeing with the Trial Judge that the goods remained the sellers  property till the goods had been brought on board the ship and so the sales were exempted from tax under article 2861b of the Constitution.
They however agreed with the Trial Judger that the sellers were liable to pay purchase tax under section 10b of the Bombay Sales Tax Act.
The only question for our decision in the appeal by the Sales Tax Officer is whether property in the goods passed on shipment or at some point of time before shipment.
The ordinary rule in FOB contracts is that it is the duty of the buyer to obtain the necessary export licence.
