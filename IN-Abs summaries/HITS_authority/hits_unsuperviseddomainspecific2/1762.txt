R P Modi and R K Garg for the respondents in CA No 8871962.
March 12 1964.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by WANCHOO J.
These four appeals arise out of four certi ficates granted by the High Court of Rajasthan and raise a common question.
The respondent was a resident of the former Dholpur State and the dispute which led to the suit related to a time before the merger of former Dholpur State into the Matsya Union.
It was also the practice in that State that when permits for export were issued export duties had to be paid in advance though the actual export was made later.
Consequently in June 1947 the respondent applied for and was granted a permit for export of 15000 maunds of chuni and in connection therewith he deposited Rs 30000as export duty in advance.
The respondent however was not able to export the entire quantity of 15000 maunds for which the permit was granted he could only export 4572 maunds and 20 seers of chuni before December 2 1947.
His case further was that though he asked the State for refund of this advance duty the State did not pay back the same to him.
By May 15 1949 the United State of Rajasthan was formed including the Matsya Union into which the former State of Dholpur had merged on March 17 1948.
The United State of Rajasthan eventually became the Part B State of Rajasthan on January 26 1950 when the Constitution came into force.
