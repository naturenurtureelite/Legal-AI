M K Ramamurthi for the respondents.
It is unnecessary to set out the facts of the two appeals at this stage.
It is sufficient to say that the respondents made applications under section 33 C2 of the Industrial Disputes Act No 14 of 1947 praying for determination and computation of the benefit to which they were entitled under the Desai award as they were not satisfied with the fixation of their pay by the appellant bank under para 5356.
The Desai award dealt with the method of adjustment in the scales of pay fixed by it from para 5329 onwards.
It divided the employees of the banks with which it was concerned in two groups.
The second group 900 consisted of workmen who on January 1 1962 were employed in banks which were not governed by the provisions of the Sastry award as modified and were not thus drawing basic pay on the footing of scales of pay provided by that award.
Examples of how this would be done were given in para.
5348 of the Desai award.
5348.
Paragraph 5356 then went on to provide how these workmen would be fitted in the Sastry award.
Here again the workmen were divided into two groups namely those who entered service before January 1 1959 and those who entered service on or after January 1 1959.
In the present appeals we are concerned with workmen who entered service before January 1 1959 and the fitment of these workmen was dealt with in para.
5356 of the Desai award and it is this paragraph which calls for interpretation in the present appeals.
We may at this stage mention that a similar question of fit ment was considered by the Sastry award in para.
This paragraph was considered by the Labour Appellate Tribunal in appeal from the Sastry award and certain modifications were made thereunder by paras 164 and 166 of the Labour Appellate Tribunal decision in appeal.
Paragraph 292 as modified by the Labour Appellate Tribunal decision came up for interpretation before this Court in State Bank of India vs Prakash Chand Mehra.
1 As the words of para 292 of the Sastry award as modified by the Labour Appellate Decision are almost the same as the words of para.
3In the matter of adjustment all efficiency bars whether in the previously existing or in the scales fixed by us should be ignored.
