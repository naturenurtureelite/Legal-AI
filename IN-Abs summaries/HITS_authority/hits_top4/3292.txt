488 N N Goswamy and Arvind Minocha for the appellant.
Against that decree an appeal was preferred by the appellant to the High Court.
An application was made on 1 2 1971 by the appellant stating that Som Dass died on 26 11 1970 leaving behind him Shiam Dass as his Chela and for impleading him.
The High Court referred the question to the trial Court for enquiry and decision.
When a suit is brought by or against a person in a representative capacity and there is a devolution of the interest of the representative the rule that has to be applied is Order 22 rule 10 and not rule 3 or 4 whether the devolution takes place as a consequence of death or for any other reason.
We are of the view that devolution of the interest in the subject matter of the suit took place when Shiam Dass was elected as mahant of the Dera after the death of Som Dass.
In Thirumalai vs Arunachella 2 the Court held that a succeeding trustee of a trustee who filed a suit and thereafter died during its pendency was not legal representative of the predecessor in office.
