Eventually when the State refused to refund the amount the suit was filed out of which appeal No 887 has arisen in January 1952.
It was a new sovereign and was not bound by any obligation against the old sovereign of the former State of Dholpur unless it chose to recognise the obligation.
In March 1949 the United State of Rajasthan was formed by Covenant entered into by fourteen Rulers of Rajasthan including these who had formed the Former State of Rajasthan.
Further though in that case it was held that article VI could not be enforced by citizens against the new sovereign as it was part of the Covenant which was an act of State this Court went on to point out that article VI of the Covenant would be valuable evidence from which affirmance of the rights mentioned therein could be inferred and added that such inference must relate to act or conduct of the new State after it came into existence.
But whereas in the present case the old laws were to continue till they were repealed or altered it follows in our opinion that the rights arising under the old laws in the subjects of the merging States would continue and these subjects would have the same rights against the new State as they would have under the old laws against the merging State.
Whether that is so or not it follows in view of the history to which we have referred that there was always recognition by the new State of its liability in the manner already referred to with respect to the liabilities of the merging States and if there is any doubt about it that doubt in our opinion is resolved by the existence of article VI or similar provision throughout the process of these political changes.
