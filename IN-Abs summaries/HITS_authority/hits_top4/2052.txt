It will be seen from the above comparison of the provisions in the two awards that the substantial provisions of the Desai award are exactly the same as the provisions of the Sastry award as modified except i for changes necessitated by the fact that the Desai award was being given in 1962 and ii the provision in the Sastry award corresponding to sub cl.
Further cl.
iv but this will be subject to cls.
i and ii and the adjusted basic pay arrived at by giving the increments under sub cls.
b and c cannot exceed the adjusted basic pay as arrived at by point to point adjustment in the Sastry award as modified or the maximum of that scale or the actual basic pay as on 1st January 1959 as the case may be.
iv and cl.
iv have to be added but this is again subject to the provisions of cls.
i and ii.
The appellant bank s contention is that two further annual increments allowed under sub cl.
d cannot be permitted in view of cl.
ii the adjusted basic pay has to be fixed as on January 1 1959 sub cl.
iv will take effect and give two annual increments for 1960 and 1961 which are beyond the date which we have accepted as the right date for purposes of cl.
ii provides cannot be given.
d as was done by the Labour Appellate Tribunal in its modification of the Sastry award.
But as stated by the Labour Appellate Tribunal when dealing with the Sastry award it was inherent in the Sastry award that increments for 1951 and 1952 should be provided after the basic pay was worked out as on January 31 1950.
Once it is held and that we hold that basic pay under cl.
ii has to be worked out as on January 1 1959 the two increments provided by sub cl.
iv which are beyond that date must 905 be given over and above what has been worked out under sub cls.
iv of the Desai award.
ii works.
Therefore two increments under sub cl.
i and ii to mean.
d must always be given.
c may in some cases be not available where the actual pay as on January 1 1959 which will not be reduced under el.
This interpretation is in accord with what was decided by this Court in Prakash Chand Mehra s case1 and that decision in our opinion would govern the interpretation of para.
5356 of the Desai award also which as we have indicated is in substance the same as para.
iv his salary has to be fixed as on January 1 1959 at Rs 106.
b and c because his actual salary coincided with the adjusted basic pay in the Sastry award scale as modified as on January 1 1959.
d for the years 1960 and 1961 and his salary therefore as on January 1 1962 under the Sastry award would come to Rs 119.
As Rs 119 is the eleventh stage in the Sastry scale Ram Parkash would be entitled to the eleventh stage in the Desai scale which would be Rs 170.
i his salary cannot be fixed below Rs 100 which he was actually getting.
iv his salary will be fixed at Rs 100.
b and c of cl.
iv he would be fixed at Rs 100 as on January 1 1959 and would be entitled to increments under sub cl.
d which will bring his salary to Rs 112 as on January 1 1962.
We therefore allow CA 1008 and set aside the order of the labour court and dismiss the application of Ram Parkash.
CA 1008 allowed.
CA 1009 dismissed.
