4 5 6 7  J 92  8 AIR 413 High Court India Nutriments Ltd vs Registrar of Companies1 and PSNSA Chettiar  Company vs Registrar of Companies2 of the Madras High Court.
If no balance sheet is laid before a general body there can be no question of that balance sheet not being adopted nor of complying with the requirements of the Sub section 2 of Section 134 of the Old Companies Act or Section 220 of the Act as the case may be while wilful omission to call a general body meeting and omit to lay the balance sheet and profit and loss account before it may expose the person responsible to punishment under other provisions of the Act it certainly does not make him liable udder aforesaid provisions.
Solicitor General who appeared for the State of Andhra Pradesh and the learned Solicitor General who appeared for the Advocate General of Andhra Pradesh fairly placed before this Court all the decisions for and against which we have already referred to and also placed before us all the relevant considerations.
supra that a company or its directors in a prosecution under section 32 and section 133 of the 1913 Act could not in defence to such prosecution rely upon their own 415 failure to call the general body meeting applies with equal force to a prosecution under section 134 of the Act.
A different offence might have been committed either under section 762 or under section 1333.
The appeal is dismissed.
