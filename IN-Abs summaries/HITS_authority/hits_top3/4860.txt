781 VS Desai Mrs J Wad and Miss Aruna Mathur for the Appellants.
Accused 5 and 6 only have filed Criminal Appeal 288 of 1980 and Criminal Appeal 287 of 1980 respectively against the conviction of accused 5 and the sentence of imprisonment for life awarded by the High Court under section 302 read with section 120B IPC and the confirmation of the conviction and sentence awarded to accused 6 by the trial court under section 302 read with section 34 IPC respectively.
But the Serologist was unable to determine the origin of the blood found on article 55 due to its disintegration.
We are of the opinion that the retracted judicial confession of accused 5 could not be relied upon against accused 6 in this case in view of the fact that accused 6 who had been tried alongwith accused 5 had been acquitted by the High Court of the charge of conspiracy under section 302 read with section 120B IPC and accused 5 was not charged for the offence of murder of Malan for which only accused 1 6 and 7 were tried.
