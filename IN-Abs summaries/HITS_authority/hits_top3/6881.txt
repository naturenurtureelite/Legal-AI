The courts below 126 have negatived this contention solely on the ground that it cannot stand after the pronouncement of this Court in the case of Jagdish supra.
Under the Punjab Pre emption Act 1905 the corresponding provision section 12 con ferred a right of pre emption in the case of a sale of a share of such land or properly held jointly firstly in the lineal discendents of the vendor in male line in order of succession secondly in the co sharers if any who are agnates in order of succession thirdly in the persons described in sub clause a ie in persons who but for such sale would be entitled to inherit the properly in the event of his or their decease in order of succession and fourth ly in the co sharers jointly or severally.
Read in the context it becomes clear that the legislature desired to confer the right of pre emption on specified family members of the vendor or vendors in the first three clauses of section 151b and with a view to covering all the remaining co sharers not specifically mentioned the preceding clauses it used the expression other co sharers  in the fourth clause which was meant to serve as a residuary clause to ensure 127 that no co sharer is left out.
What this Court disapproved as offen sive to Articles 14 and 15 is the classification based on consanguinity and not on co ownership.
