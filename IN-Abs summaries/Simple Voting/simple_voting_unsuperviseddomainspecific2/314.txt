The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMA AYYAR J.
The appellant was a Sub Divisional Officer in the Public Works Department Pepsu and was at the material dates in charge of certain works at a place called Karhali.
In the roll for April 1951 one Parma was mentioned as a khalasi menial servant and a sum of Rs 51 shown as paid to him for his wages the payment being vouched by thumbimpression.
The First Class Magistrate of Patiala before whom the appellant was put up for trial framed charges against him under section 465 of the Indian Penal Code for forging the thumb impression of Parma and under section 409 of the Indian Penal Code for criminal misappropriation of Rs 51 and after a full trial 167 1304 acquitted him.
He held on the evidence that there was a khalasi Parma by name in the service of the accused at Kehrauli and that though the thumbimpression in the acquittance roll was that of the appellant the prosecution had not established that the amount drawn by him did not reach the hands of Parma.
Against this judgment there was an appeal by the State to the High Court of Pepsu which held that proof that the thumb impression in the acquittance roll was that of the appellant was sufficient when taken along with other circumstances to establish his guilt and accordingly convicted him both under section 465 and section 409 of the Indian Penal Code.
According to the respondent however the main charge against the appellant is under section 409 and no sanction is required for a prosecution under that section.
The point for decision is whether sanction under section 197 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is necessary for prosecuting the appellant under section 409.
The view taken in H H B Gill vs The King1 was followed by the Privy Council in A16 ert West Meads vs The King  and reaffirmed in Phanindra Chandra vs 1 1948 LR 75 IA 41.

Now it is evident that the entrustment andor dominion here were in an official capacity and it is equally evident that there could in this case be no disposal lawful or otherwise save by an act done or purporting to be done in an official capacity.

But if they are unconnected with such duties then no sanction is necessary.
The conviction should therefore be quashed.
Appeal allowed.
