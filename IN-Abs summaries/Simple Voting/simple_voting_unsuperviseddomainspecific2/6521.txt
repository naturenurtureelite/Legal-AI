From the Judgment and Order dated 1761977 of the Madras High Court in OSA 62 of 1973.
TS Krishnamurthy lyer MJ Paul and Kailash Vasudev for the Appellant.
K Parasaran PD Sharma TK Seshadri and K Swami for the Respondents.
549 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by RANGANATHAN J.
A very interesting question comes up for consideration in this appeal.
It belonged to several co owners.
The firm and its partners arc hereinafter compendiously referred to as the tenants .
The first lease Ext.
P 1 was dated 229.
1947 and related to Door No 2 Item No1 in Schedule A to the plaint.
This was a property comprising of an area of 4 grounds and 151 square feet with certain buildings thereon.
The rent for the premises was Rs 150 per month.
The second lease deed Ext.
P 2 dated 310.
1947 relating to Door No 3 Item 2 in Schedule A to the plaint covered an area of 8700 sq.
and some building thereon.
The fair rent claimed was computed at Rs239903 per month in respect of item No 1 as against the rent of Rs 150 pm fixed under the lease deed.
In respect of item 2 the fair rent claimed was Rs326650 as against Rs200 pm payable under the lease deed.
The defendants GG and his sons filed their objections to the above applications.
There were appeals to the Court of Small Causes.
It may be mentioned here that even in certain earlier proceedings for fixation of fair rent and eviction HRC 86773 and HRC 255764 it had been held by the Rent Controller that item No 1 door No 2 belonged to the LIC but his order of eviction had been set aside by the appellate court on some other ground.
The tenants filed revision petitions against the order of the Court of Small Causes but these were dismissed on 20111968.
It may be mentioned here that the tenant filed CS 87 of 1972 claiming protection under the Madras City Tenants  Protection Act but this suit and further appeals therefrom have been dismissed.
Turn 551 ing now to CS No 54 of 1969 which was disposed of along with CS No 87 of 72 by a common judgment dated 23101972 the contention urged on behalf of the tenants was that since the subject matter of the lease under exhibit P 1 was only a vacant site the Rent Controller had no juris diction to fix the fair rent in respect thereof and that therefore the claim in the suit for arrears of rent based on the Rent Controller s order in respect of the premises covered by exhibit P 1 had to fail.
After referring to the terms of the sale deed exhibit P 3 the superstructure constructed on the land was held to have been conveyed to the vendee under the sale deed dated 30 7 1953 and to have thus vested in the LIC.
The tenants filed an appeal being OSA No 62 of 1973.
The Appellate Bench confirmed the decree in respect of item No 2 subject to certain modifications which are not here relevant.
However so far as item No 1 was concerned the Appellate Bench vacated the decree passed by the trial court.
It held that there was a valid tease between the quondam owners and the tenants under Exts.
In conse quence it was held the LIC could not maintain the suit for recovery of rent based on the order made by the statutory tribunal under the Rent Control Act and claim the difference between the so called fair rent and the contract rent.
OSA 62 of 1973 was therefore allowed to that extent.
