Appeals by special leave from the judgment and order dated May 2 1960 of the Kerala High Court in Income tax Referred case No 98 of 1955M.
SARKAR J.
The claim was rejected by the Income tax Officer and by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and also by the Income tax Appellate Tribunal on appeal to it.
The appellant then moved the Tribunal to refer a certain question to the High Court at Madras under section 661 of the Act but that application was rejected.
The facts have to be stated at some length but before we do that we think it would be profitable to set out the statutory provisions concerned.
Though we are directly concerned with sub sec.
3 of that section will throw useful light on the matter 96 in question and so we set both these sub sections out below section 25 3 Where any business profession or vocation on which tax was at any time charged under the provisions of the Indian Income tax Act 1918   is discontinued then unless there has been a succession by virtue of which the provisions of sub section 4 have been rendered applicable no tax shall be payable in respect of the income pro fits and gains of the period between the end of the previous year and the date of such discontinuance  4 Where the person who was at the commencement of the Indian Income tax Amendment Act 1939 carrying on any business profession or vocation on which tax was at any time charged under the provisions of the Indian Income tax Act 1918 is succeeded in such capacity by another person the change not being merely a change in the constitution of a partnership no tax shall be payable by the first mentioned person in respect of the income profits and gains of the period between the end of the previous year and the date of such succession Both these sub sections gave a further right to the assessee but with that right we are not concerned and shall there fore make no more reference to it.
