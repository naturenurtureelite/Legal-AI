N Criminal Appeal No 34 of 1970.
F section Nariman Additional Solicitor General of India and A V Rangam for the appellants.
L N Sinha Solicitor General of India and A V V Nair for the Advocate General Andhra Pradesh.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by ALAGIRISWAMI J.
It arises out of a complaint filed against the 1st respondent company and its directors for failure to Me with the Registrar of Companies on or before 30 10 1967 the balance sheet and profit and loss account of the company as required under section 2201 of the  which is punishable under sub section 3 of that section.
Admittedly no general body meeting had been held and therefore the balance sheet and profit and loss account had not been laid before a general body meeting nor could it be so laid.
The Full Bench speaking through Jaganmohan Reddy CJ as our learned brother then was held that if no balance sheet is laid before a general body there can be no question of that balance sheet not being adopted nor of complying with the requirements of section 220 and though wilful omission to call a general body meeting and to lay the balance sheet and profit and loss account before it may expose the person responsible to punishment under other provisions of the Act it certainly does not make him liable under the provisions of section 1344 of the Companies Act 1913 or section 220 of the .
6 have also taken a similar view.
We may now refer to some of the earlier decisions on this Point.
 In this state of difference of opinion among the various High Courts and the absence of a decision of this Court on section 134 this appeal has been filed.
The appeal is dismissed.
VPS Appeal dismissed.
