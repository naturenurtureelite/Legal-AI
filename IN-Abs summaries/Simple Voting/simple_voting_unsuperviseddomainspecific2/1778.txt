Appeal No 251 of 1963.
M C Setalvad and R C Prasad for the appellants.
The respondent did not appear.
This question has to be answered in the light of the definition prescribed by section 2vi before it was amended in 1958.
The subsequent amendment expressly provides by section 2vi a that any remuneration payable under any award or settlement between the parties or order of a Court would be included in the main definition under section 2vi.
This agreement was subsequently published in the Bihar Gazette as a part of the award.
In spite of the award and the agreement the appellant paid its employees only As.
The respondents contended before the payment of wages authority that the refusal of the appellant to pay to them wages at the rate awarded in substance amounted to an illegal deduction from their wages and on that basis they asked for an order from the authority directing the appellant to pay to the respondents the said prescribed wages.
The appellant raised two pleas against the respondents  claim.
It urged that section 15 of the Act was inapplicable because the rates of wages fixed by the award did not fall within the definition of wages prescribed by section 2vi and it also argue that the claim of the respondents was barred by limitation.
On that view the writ petition filed by the appellant was dismissed.
That in brief is the substance of the argument raised by the appellant.
