The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS GUPTA J.
Ms.
Daulatram Rameshwarlal a firm registered under the Indian Partnership Act referred to later in this judgment as sellers  are registered dealers under section 11 of the Bombay Sales Tax Act.
In their return of turnover for the period from April 1 1954 to March 31 1955 they claimed exemption from Sales Tax in respect of sales of cotton of the total value of Rs 68493 2 6 and sales of castor oil of the total value of Rs 647509 1 6 on the ground that these sales were oil FOB contracts under which they continued to be the owners of the goods till the goods had crossed the customs barrier and thus entered the export stream and so no tax was realisable on these sales in view of the provisions of article 286 1b.
The Sales Tax Officer rejected this claim for exemption and assessed them to sales tax on a taxable turnover including these sales.
The notice of demand for the total sales tax and the purchase tax assessed was served on the sellers on September 30 1956.
In this view the learned Judge dismissed the application under article 226.
Accordingly they directed the Sales Tax Officer not to enforce the demand for payment of sales tax with regard to the sales of cotton for Rs 68493 2 6 and sale of castor oil of the total value of Rs 647509 1 6.
Civil Appeal No 46 of 1959 has been preferred by the sellers against the appellate court s judgment in so far as it upheld the assessment of purchase tax under section 10b.
The sellers  case is that these were sales on FOB contracts.
11 and 13 of the writ petition that these sales were made on FOB basis were not denied in the counter affidavit sworn by the Sales Tax Officer.
Appeals dismissed.
