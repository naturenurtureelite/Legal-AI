Appeal No 4366 of 1991.
From the Judgment and Order dated 1651988 of the Punjab  Haryana High Court in Regular Second Appeal No 3648 of 1987.
RKKapoor and Anis Ahmed Khan for the Appellant.
Delay condoned.
Special leave granted.
Thereafter a host of writ petitions 122 were filed in this Court under Article 32 of the Constitu tion challenging the constitutional validity of section 15 on the ground that it infringed Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution.
Finding no reasonable classifi cation it struck down 124 clauses first  secondly  and thirdly  of section 151a clauses first  secondly  and thirdly  of section 151b and clause first  secondly  and third ly  of section 151c and the entire section 152 as ultra vires the Constitution.
In that case it was held that a right of pre emption by vicinage offended Article 191 f of the Constitution but a similar right conferred on co sharers was intra vires Article 1911 of the Constitution.
Since the petitioners admittedly fall either under clause First  or under clause Secondly  of Section 151b of the Act they are clearly outside the scope of clause Fourthly .
At the same time it upheld the right conferred on co sharers for reasons stated earlier.
Once conferment of the right of pre emption in favour of co sharers was considered to be a reasonable restriction on the right to hold acquire and dispose of property under Article 191 f the same re striction was held to be valid when tested on the touchstone of Articles 14 or 15 of the Constitution.
