Writ Petition No 4211 of 1983.
The question is whether it is permissible to have two pay scales in the same cadre for persons having same duties and having same responsibilities.
It is said that it would be violative of the Constitutional right of equal pay for equal work.
They will be found correctly stated in the judgment under appeal and may briefly be stated thus Prior to 1965 in the High Court of Allahabad Bench Secretaries were on a higher pay scale than that of Section Officers.
In 1965 the State Government appointed a Pay Rationalisation Committee with wide ranging reference.
It was also asked to recommend as far as possible equal emoluments for identical duties and responsibilities.
Rs 150 350 was recommended for Bench Secretaries as against Rs200 400 for Section Officers.
The State Government accepted the recommendations.
On February 1 1973 the Pay Commission submitted its report.
Section Officers have to bear more responsibilities in their Sections.
SL Appeal allowed.
