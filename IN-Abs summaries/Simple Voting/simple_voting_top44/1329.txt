Ms.
Against this decision the sellers appealed.
Accordingly they directed the Sales Tax Officer not to enforce the demand for payment of sales tax with regard to the sales of cotton for Rs 68493 2 6 and sale of castor oil of the total value of Rs 647509 1 6.
The Sales Tax Officer has on the strength of special leave granted by this Court preferred the appeal which has been numbered as Civil Appeal No 45 of 1959 against the appellate court s order directing him not to realise the sales tax in respect of sales of cotton and castor oil.
Civil Appeal No 46 of 1959 has been preferred by the sellers against the appellate court s judgment in so far as it upheld the assessment of purchase tax under section 10b.
The only question for our decision in the appeal by the Sales Tax Officer is whether property in the goods passed on shipment or at some point of time before shipment.
The sellers  case is that these were sales on FOB contracts.
Though the learned Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the Sales Tax Officer tried to convince us that these were not really FOB contract sales it appears that the averment in Paras.
11 and 13 of the writ petition that these sales were made on FOB basis were not denied in the counter affidavit sworn by the Sales Tax Officer.
What the court had to consider in these cases was not however when export commences within the meaning of the Exports Control Order but when the course of export commences for the purpose of article 2861b of the Constitution.
Mr Sanyal contended that the certificate 933 has to declare only an intention and that if ultimately the actual despatch is made by some person who is not a registered dealer it cannot strictly be said that the declaration has not been carried out.
