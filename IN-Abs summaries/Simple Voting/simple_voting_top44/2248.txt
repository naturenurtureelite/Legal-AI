Appeal No 1375 of 1966.
Appeal from the judgment and order dated October 22 1965 of the Bombay High Court Nagpur Bench in Special Civil Application No 355 of 1964.
M N Phadke and Naunit Lal for the appellant.
B R Agarwala and section B Nerkar for respondent No 1.
A K Sen A section Bobde G L Sanghi and O C Mathur for respondent No 2.
M section K Sastri R N Sachthey section P Nayar for R H Dhebar for respondent No 3.
The appellant had in this petition prayed for the issue of a writ quashing the resolution dated April 6 1964 passed by the Standing Committee Zila Parishad Nagpur and for a writ of mandamus directing the Standing Committee not to interfere with the right of the appellant to impose and collect the octroi duty pursuant to its resolution dated February 25 1963.
In order to appreciate the points raised before us it is necessary to give the relevant facts and statutory provisions.
 The Company thereupon filed an appeal before the Standing Committee Zila Parishad Nagpur hereinafter referred to as the Standing Committee on October 22 1963.
It would be noticed that the rule which authorises the levy is r22 but it enjoins that the procedure prescribed in rr3 and 4 should be followed before the octroi duty can be levied.
Under r3d what the panchayat does is to consider objections and suggestions and then finally make the choice as regards two things ie the tax or fee to be imposed and the rate at which it is to be levied.
Rule 5 follows imme diately rr3 and 4 and is headed Appeal against levy of any tax or fee and the period of sixty days of limitation commences from the date of the publication of the notice under r4 ie the notice following the decision of a Panchayat to levy any tax or fee.
Accordingly.
