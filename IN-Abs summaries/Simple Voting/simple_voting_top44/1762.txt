Appeals Nos 884 887 of 1962.
Appeals from the judgment and decree dated May 2 1960 of the Rajasthan High Court in Civil Second Appeal Nos.
March 12 1964.
The suit out of which appeal No 887 has arisen was filed by the respondent against the State of Rajasthan.
By May 15 1949 the United State of Rajasthan was formed including the Matsya Union into which the former State of Dholpur had merged on March 17 1948.
Eventually when the State refused to refund the amount the suit was filed out of which appeal No 887 has arisen in January 1952.
It was a new sovereign and was not bound by any obligation against the old sovereign of the former State of Dholpur unless it chose to recognise the obligation.
Provision was also made in the Covenant that all the assets and liabilities of the covenanting States shall be the assets and liabilities of the new State of Matsya.
In March 1949 the United State of Rajasthan was formed by Covenant entered into by fourteen Rulers of Rajasthan including these who had formed the Former State of Rajasthan.
The three second appeals were dismissed by the High Court.
That point was with respect to a clause in an agreement between the Ruler of the former Jind State and the Dalmia Dadri Cement Company with respect to income tax and certain concessions given to the company in that behalf.
Whether that is so or not it follows in view of the history to which we have referred that there was always recognition by the new State of its liability in the manner already referred to with respect to the liabilities of the merging States and if there is any doubt about it that doubt in our opinion is resolved by the existence of article VI or similar provision throughout the process of these political changes.
Two questions arose for decision there.
