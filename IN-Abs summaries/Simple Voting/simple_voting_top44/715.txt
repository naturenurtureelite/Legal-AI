The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR J.
This is an appeal by special leave against the judgment and order of the High Court of Bombay reversing the judgment of the Chief Presidency Magistrate Bombay and thus convicting accused Nos 1  5 under section 311 read with section 331 of the XIV of 1947 hereinafter called the Act and sentencing accused No 1 to a fine of Rs 250 and accused No 5 to a fine of Rs 50 736 The appellants are the Andheri Marol Kurla Bus Service who was accused No 1 now appellant No 1 and its Manager H M Khan who was accused No 5 now appellant No 2.
Some disputes arose between the appellant No 1 and its workmen.
The Act provides for commencement and conclusion of conciliation proceedings under section 20 but the first sub section of section 20 deals with what are called utility services and sub section 2 of that section provides as to when the conciliation proceedings conclude.
It was contended that the conciliation proceedings should be held to terminate when the Conciliation Officer is required under section 126 of the Act to submit his report but the provisions of the Act above quoted do not support this contention as the termination of the conciliation proceedings is deemed to take place when the report is received by the appropriate Government.
The appeal is therefore dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
