Both of them are dead.
Jaya was married to Kalbagal Junior.
429 Respondents 2 to 5 have not appeared in the proceedings.
According to her the gift deed exhibit D did not provide for devolution of interest by survivorship she pleaded that Lakshmamma had transferred all her interests in the properties comprised in the gift deed in favour of her husband Sadagopalachar who then became their sole owner.
She contended that the will had been brought into existence through the machinations of the appellant and she disputed the appellant s right to bring the present suit.
Against this decree respondent I preferred an appeal in the High Court of Mysore and the appellant filed cross objections.
On the other hand the High Court indicated that it was inclined to accept the plea raised by respondent 1 that Lakshmamma had transferred all her interest in the properties comprised in the said deed of gift in favour of her husband Sadagopalachar and since in its opinion  Lakshmamms at no time appears to have claimed that she had any interest in those properties there was considerable force in the argument urged by respondent 1 that LakShmamma must have relinquished her interest in the said properties and waived her rights in favour of her husband .
In pursuance of this certificate the High Court ordered that the appeal to this Court should be admitted and so this appeal has come to this Court.
