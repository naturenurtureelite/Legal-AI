M C Setalvad and R C Prasad for the appellants.
The respondent did not appear.
March 24 1964.
The point which we have to decide in the present appeal is whether the remuneration payable under an award was not already included in the definition of wages before the said definition was amended.
The High Court has affirmed the finding of the authority and held that section 15 was applicable to the case because the wages prescribed by the award did amount to wages as defined by section 2vi of the Act.
Section 2vi as it stood at the relevant time provides inter alia that wages means all remuneration capable of being expressed in terms of money which would if the terms of the contract of employment express or implied were fulfilled be payable.
The terms in question need not be express and can be implied but they must be terms which arise out of the contract of employment and since an award made by an Industrial Tribunal cannot be said to amount to a contract of employment the wage structure prescribed by the award cannot fall within the definition prescribed by section 2vi.
That in brief is the substance of the argument raised by the appellant.
The true legal position is that when industrial disputes are decided by industrial adjudication and awards are made the said awards supplant contractual terms in respect of matters covered by them and are substituted for them.
