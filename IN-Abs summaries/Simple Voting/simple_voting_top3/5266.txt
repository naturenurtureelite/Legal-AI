The Chief Town Planner who was deputed to visit the site at the request of the Secretary Metropolitan Development Department and who visited the Zoo accompanied by the Director of the Zoo reported that 2 to 212 acres of land might be made avail able for the hotel.
We cannot do so in the face of the assurance of the Chief Minister that facilities would be provided for the Zoo and if as the saying goes the proof of the pudding is in the eating the Chief Minister s assurances are found reflected in the lease executed by the Taj Group of Hotels in favour of the Government of West Bengal.
The Alipore Zoological Garden authorities were required to vacate the existing structure within a period of six months which was also the period stipulated for raising the new constructions.
We have no doubt that the Government was quite alive to the need for expan sion of the zoo when they decided to grant four acres of Begumbari land which was not used for the main purpose of the zoo for the construction of a Five Star hotel.
In this letter the Chief Minister pointed out that there were already in existence a number of multistoreyed buildings all around the Zoological Garden but there was no report that they had any adverse effect on the migratory birds or the animals.
He also pointed out that all precautions would be taken in the matter of illumination of the hotel and lay out of the surroundings so that no disturbance would be caused to the flight path of the birds or animals.
He pointed out that the four acre plot was not within the main Zoological Garden but was separated from it by the Belvedere Road which was an important thoroughfare in the city.
The hotel was porposed to be built away from the frontage of the plot in Belvedere Road and was to be a low rise structure the highest point of which would not exceed 75 feet.
