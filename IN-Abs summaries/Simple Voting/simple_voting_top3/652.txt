The Market Committees.
The appellants in the above three appeals and others filed writ petitions in the High Court of Madras against 1 the State of Madras 2 the Collectors of the concerned Districts and 3 the Chairmen of the Market Committees for the issue of a Writ of Mandamus directing the respondents to forbear from enforcing any or all the provisions of the Act as amended and the Rules and Bylaws framed thereunder.
Shortly stated the Act Rules and the Bye laws framed thereunder have a long term target of providing a net work of markets wherein facilities for correct weigbment are ensured storage accommodation is provided and equal powers of bargaining ensured so that the growers may bring their commercial crops to the market and sell them at reasonable prices.
The result of the implementation of the Act would be to eliminate as far as possible the middlemen and to give reasonable facilities for the growers of commercial crops to secure best prices for their commodities.
It is also said that when a market is established no licence to purchase or sell commercial crops will be granted or renewed in respect of any place situated within such distance from the market as may from time to time be fixed by the State Government and that nothing under the Act prevents the Government from fixing a long distance as a prohibited area with the result that a person who is having a licence to trade in and about the place where the market is fixed is deprived of his livelihood which is an unreasonable restriction upon his right to do business.
