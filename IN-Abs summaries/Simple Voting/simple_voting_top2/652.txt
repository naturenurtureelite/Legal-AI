Appeals Nos 169 171 of 1955.
Appeals from the judgment and order dated July 10 1953 of the Madras High Court in Writ Petitions Nos 75 87 and 135 of 1953.
R Ganapathy Iyer and Shanmugavel for the appellants.
October 6.
The appellants in the above three appeals and others filed writ petitions in the High Court of Madras against 1 the State of Madras 2 the Collectors of the concerned Districts and 3 the Chairmen of the Market Committees for the issue of a Writ of Mandamus directing the respondents to forbear from enforcing any or all the provisions of the Act as amended and the Rules and Bylaws framed thereunder.
It is also said that when a market is established no licence to purchase or sell commercial crops will be granted or renewed in respect of any place situated within such distance from the market as may from time to time be fixed by the State Government and that nothing under the Act prevents the Government from fixing a long distance as a prohibited area with the result that a person who is having a licence to trade in and about the place where the market is fixed is deprived of his livelihood which is an unreasonable restriction upon his right to do business.
If on the other hand mahimai  is a trade allowance the said part of the 109 bye law will be superfluous as the allowance falls within the terms of the section itself This leads us to the question whether  mahimai  is a trade allowance within the meaning of section 14 of the Act.
Appeals dismissed.
