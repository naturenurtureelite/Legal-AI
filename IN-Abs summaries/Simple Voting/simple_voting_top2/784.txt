The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAs C J.
These three appeals are directed against the judgment and order pronounced by a Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court on November 20 1957 whereby three writ petitions namely No 1 of 1956 No 19 of 1957 and No 470 of 1957 which had been filed by the appellant and were heard together were dismissed with costs.
These appeals have been filed with certificates granted by the High Court of Andhra Pradesh .
The circumstances under which the three writ petitions came to be filed by the appellant may now be narrated.
On the expiry of the fifth year however the Rajah granted another lease to the said Balumuri Nageswara Rao for a short period commencing from February 1 1947 and ending on November 30 1947.
Thereupon the Board of Revenue passed an order on December 27 1955 declaring that the lease to the appellant had been granted subsequent to July 1 1945 and that as the lease was for a period exceeding one year it was not enforceable against the Government according to the second proviso to section 20 1 of the Abolition Act.
The appellant promptly filed writ petition No 1 of 1956 praying for the issue of a writ of mandamus directing the State of Andhra Pradesh to forbear from terminating his leasehold right in the slate quarries.
That application was dismissed on May 23 1957.
The long title and the preamble to the Abolition Act indicate it is urged that the object of the Act is to provide for the acquisition of the rights of landholders and that the policy of the Act is not to interfere with the rights of other persons in the estate.
In other words the third proviso according to learned counsel 559 for the appellant merely enables the Government to exercise the right conferred on it by the second proviso and therefore the Government if it intends to avail itself of the right under the second proviso must comply with the conditions laid down in the third proviso.
If the third proviso also applies to such leases as the petitioners contend then the lease can be terminated only if the Government is satisfied that it is in the public interest that it should be terminated and that further in such cases the lessee will also be entitled to compensation under section 202.
