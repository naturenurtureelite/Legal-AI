il Appeal Nos 931 and 1149 of 1965.
Appeals from the judgment and decree dated July 31 1964 of the Calcutta High Court in Appeal from Original Decree No 613 of 1962.
N C Chatterjee Janaradan Sharma K B Rohtagi and section Balakrishnan for the appellant in CA No 931 of 1965 and the respondent in C A No 1149 of 1965.
The objection was rejected by the Returning Officer.
At the hearing of the petition by the Election Tribunal however he challenged the election only on the ground that Abhoy Pada was a member of the Saha caste and not a member of a Scheduled Caste.
In our view it was open to the respondent to show that the appellant belonged to the Saha caste group within the Sunri caste group and did not therefore belong to the Schedule Caste specified in item 40 as he claimed.
He also held that the evidence did not establish that the Sahas formed a sub caste strictly so called within the Sunri caste of a caste wholly independent of the Sunri caste.
The learned Judges of the High Court thought that the effect of the item was to exclude from the Sunri caste those who belonged to that caste but bore the surname Saha.
