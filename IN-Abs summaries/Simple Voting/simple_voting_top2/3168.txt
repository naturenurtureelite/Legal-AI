Admittedly no general body meeting had been held and therefore the balance sheet and profit and loss account had not been laid before a general body meeting nor could it be so laid.
Referring to the decision of the Bombay High Court in that case this Court pointed out that decision turned on section 134 of the Companies Act 1913 the language of which was to a certain extent different from the language used in sections 32 and 131 and refrained from going into the question whether the difference in language in section 134 on the one hand and sections 32 and 131 on the other made any difference to the decision of the case.
After referring to the decisions in Gibson vs Barlon2 Edmonds vs Foster3 and Park vs Lawton4 where it was held that a person charged with an offence could not rely on his own default as an answer to the charge and so if the person charged was responsible for not calling the general meeting he cannot be heard to say in defence to the charge that the general meeting had not been called and that the company and its officers were bound to perform the condition precedent if they could do that in order that they might perform their duty this Court considered that as the correct view to take.
4 5 6 7  J 92  8 AIR 413 High Court India Nutriments Ltd vs Registrar of Companies1 and PSNSA Chettiar  Company vs Registrar of Companies2 of the Madras High Court.
A different offence might have been committed either under section 762 or under section 1333.
It is clear therefore that on principle and authority it should be held that no offence was committed by the directors in this case under section 134.
VPS Appeal dismissed.
