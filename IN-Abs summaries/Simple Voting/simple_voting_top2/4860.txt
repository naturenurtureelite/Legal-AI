781 VS Desai Mrs J Wad and Miss Aruna Mathur for the Appellants.
OP Rana K V Sree Kumar and MN Shroff for the Respondent.
After hearing the learned counsel for the parties we allowed the appeal of Prakash accused 5 and acquitted him and set aside his conviction and the sentence awarded to him.
So far as Vinayak accused 6 is concerned we dismissed his appeal on 1391984 for reason to follow.
Now proceed to record our reasons.
Sessions Case 26 of 1977 is stated to be an off shoot of what is known as the Manwath murders case  in which Prakash s father Uttamrao Barhate and his permanently kept concubine Rukmanibai and 13 others were tried for the murders of 10 girls and women during the period from 14111972 to 4 111974 in Manwath village Prabhani district Maharashtra State.
The last charge No 4 framed against accused 1 6 and 7 was under section 302 read with section 34 IPC on the allegation that in pursuance of the conspiracy and in furtherance of their common intention they committed the murder of Malan on or about 111976.
He found accused 1 to 3 not guilty of charge No 2 framed against them in respect of the murder of Ashamati and accused 1 to 4 not guilty of charge No 3 framed against them in respect of the murder of Parubai and acquitted them.
We were therefore not called upon to consider any such question.
