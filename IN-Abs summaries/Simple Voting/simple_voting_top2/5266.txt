The Great Chief sends word he will reserve us a place so that we can live comfortably to ourselves.

Whatever befalls the earth befalls the sons of the earth.
Whatever he does to the web he does to himself.
We may be brothers after all.

The white too shall pass perhaps sooner than all other tribes.
