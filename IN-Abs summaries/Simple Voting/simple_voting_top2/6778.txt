Section 21 of the Indian Penal Code states that a public servant denotes a person falling under any of the descrip tion mentioned therein Third Every Judge including any person empowered by law to discharge whether by himself or as a member of any body of persons any adjudicarory functions.
 Thus the definition of a public servant is very wide enough to include Judges of the Supreme Court as well as Judges of the High Court.
Sub article 2 of Article 124 further provides that every Judge of the Supreme Court shall be appointed by the President by warrant under his hand and seal after consultation with such of the Judges of the Supreme Court and of the High Courts in the States as the President may deem necessary for the purpose and shall hold office until he attains the age of sixty five years.
Article 2 18 states that provisions of clauses 4 and 5 of Article 124 shall apply in relation to a High Court.
But it is necessary to remind ourselves that the concept of independence of the judiciary is not limited only to independence from execu tive pressure or influence but it is a much wider concept which takes within its sweep independence from many other pressures and prejudices.
