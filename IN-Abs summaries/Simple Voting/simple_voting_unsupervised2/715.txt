The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR J.
This is an appeal by special leave against the judgment and order of the High Court of Bombay reversing the judgment of the Chief Presidency Magistrate Bombay and thus convicting accused Nos 1  5 under section 311 read with section 331 of the XIV of 1947 hereinafter called the Act and sentencing accused No 1 to a fine of Rs 250 and accused No 5 to a fine of Rs 50 736 The appellants are the Andheri Marol Kurla Bus Service who was accused No 1 now appellant No 1 and its Manager H M Khan who was accused No 5 now appellant No 2.
Some disputes arose between the appellant No 1 and its workmen.
The Chief Presidency Magistrate acquitted all the accused including the appellants and held that as the conciliation proceedings had continued for a period of more than 14 days as from January 17 1952 further proceedings for conciliation were illegal and therefore the accused persons could not be convicted under section 311of the Act.
The State took an appeal to the High Court and the judgment of acquittal was reversed and of the accused persons the two appellants were convicted and the others were acquitted.
The question for decision is whether the conciliation proceedings could be said to be pending when Louis Pereira was dismissed.
The appeal is therefore dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
