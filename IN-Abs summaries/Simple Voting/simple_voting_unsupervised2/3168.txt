The Judgment of the Court was delivered by ALAGIRISWAMI J.
Admittedly no general body meeting had been held and therefore the balance sheet and profit and loss account had not been laid before a general body meeting nor could it be so laid.
The Full Bench speaking through Jaganmohan Reddy CJ as our learned brother then was held that if no balance sheet is laid before a general body there can be no question of that balance sheet not being adopted nor of complying with the requirements of section 220 and though wilful omission to call a general body meeting and to lay the balance sheet and profit and loss account before it may expose the person responsible to punishment under other provisions of the Act it certainly does not make him liable under the provisions of section 1344 of the Companies Act 1913 or section 220 of the .
After referring to the decisions in Gibson vs Barlon2 Edmonds vs Foster3 and Park vs Lawton4 where it was held that a person charged with an offence could not rely on his own default as an answer to the charge and so if the person charged was responsible for not calling the general meeting he cannot be heard to say in defence to the charge that the general meeting had not been called and that the company and its officers were bound to perform the condition precedent if they could do that in order that they might perform their duty this Court considered that as the correct view to take.
6 have also taken a similar view.
The appeal is dismissed.
