A K Sen A section Bobde G L Sanghi and O C Mathur for respondent No 2.
M section K Sastri R N Sachthey section P Nayar for R H Dhebar for respondent No 3.
The appellant had in this petition prayed for the issue of a writ quashing the resolution dated April 6 1964 passed by the Standing Committee Zila Parishad Nagpur and for a writ of mandamus directing the Standing Committee not to interfere with the right of the appellant to impose and collect the octroi duty pursuant to its resolution dated February 25 1963.
In order to appreciate the points raised before us it is necessary to give the relevant facts and statutory provisions.
The Village Panchayat of Kanhan Pipri hereinafter referred to as the Panchayat was originally constituted under the CP  Berar Panchayat Act 1946 CP  Berar Act No 1 of 1947.
We are concerned with Part ITT.
Fixing of octroi limits and nakas.
Payment of octroi on introduction of goods etc.
It would be noticed that the rule which authorises the levy is r22 but it enjoins that the procedure prescribed in rr3 and 4 should be followed before the octroi duty can be levied.
The inhabitants of the village would be entitled to object only to these two matters namely 1 the tax or fee imposed and the rate at which it is levied.
Under r3d what the panchayat does is to consider objections and suggestions and then finally make the choice as regards two things ie the tax or fee to be imposed and the rate at which it is to be levied.
