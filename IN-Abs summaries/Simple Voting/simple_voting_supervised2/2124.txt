DN Mukherjee for the respondent in CA No 931 of 1965 and the appellant in CA No 1149 of 1965.
These appeals arise out of an election to a seat in the West Bengal Legislative Assembly from the Khargram Murshidabad constitutency reserved for members of the Scheduled Castes.
The contestants at this election were Abhoy Pada Saha and Sudhir Kumar Mondal.
Sudhir is admittedly a member of a Scheduled Caste.
Abhoy Pada described himself in the nomination paper as a member of the Sunri caste which is a Scheduled Caste.
The objection was rejected by the Returning Officer.
At the hearing of the petition by the Election Tribunal however he challenged the election only on the ground that Abhoy Pada was a member of the Saha caste and not a member of a Scheduled Caste.
In his petition Sudhir had further claimed that he should be declared elected in the place of the appellant if the latter s election was found to be invalid.
This prayer however was rejected by the High Court.
Nobody disputes that.
the other must be a caste.
The error of the Tribunal lay in interpreting the Order in the light of the evidence before it.
After all the evidence led in a case may be imperfect.
