4 5 6 7  J 92  8 AIR 413 High Court India Nutriments Ltd vs Registrar of Companies1 and PSNSA Chettiar  Company vs Registrar of Companies2 of the Madras High Court.
That decision is also pending in appeal before this Court.
The Patna High Court in State vs Linkers Private Ltd5 and the Kerala High Court in Registrar of Companies vs Gopala Pillai  Ors.
We may now refer to some of the earlier decisions on this Point.
The decision in Ballav Dass vs Mohan Lal Sadhu9 did not refer to the wording of the section but merely stated that the provisions of section 134 were not complied with.
If no general body meeting is held it is obvious that no copies of the balance sheet 1 3 AIR 1969 Orissa 234.
It may be that copies of the balance sheet so laid before the general body may have been forwarded under sub section 1 of Section 134 of the Old Companies Act or sub section 1 of section 220 of the Act but nonetheless if the requirements of sub section 2 of the respective sections have not been complied with even then the persons concerned would be liable for punishment for that default.
Though the respondent was not represented before this Court the learned Addl.
But section 134 lays down that after balance sheet and profit and loss account or the income and expenditure account as the case may be have been laid before the company at the general meeting three copies thereof shall be filed with the registrar and a failure to do so is made punishable under sub section 4 of that section.
We say nothing about section 32 about which this Court has already laid down the law.
