iminal Appeal No 48 of 1954.
1303 Appeal by Special Leave granted by the Supreme Court by its Order dated the 31st July 1953 from the Judgment and Order dated the 15th May 1953 of the High Court of Judicature for the State of Pepsu at Th Patiala in Criminal Appeal No 140 of 1952 arising out of the Judgment and Order dated the 31st March 1952 of the Court of Magistrate 1st Class Patiala in Challan Case No 160102 of 1951.
Jai Gopal Sethi Naunit Lal with him for the appellant.
N section Bindra Porus A Mehta and P G Gokhale with him for the respondent.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMA AYYAR J.
The appellant was a Sub Divisional Officer in the Public Works Department Pepsu and was at the material dates in charge of certain works at a place called Karhali.
1305 The position therefore is that the prosecution which has resulted in the conviction of the appellant was initiated without any sanction under section 1971 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and if sanction under that section is necessary as contended for by Mr Sethi then the entire proceedings including the conviction must be quashed.
The facts in that case were that a Sub Assistant Surgeon was charged under section 409 with having dishonestly removed certain medicines from a hospital which was under his charge to his own residence and under section 477 A with having failed to enter them in the stock book.
The view taken in H H B Gill vs The King1 was followed by the Privy Council in A16 ert West Meads vs The King  and reaffirmed in Phanindra Chandra vs 1 1948 LR 75 IA 41.

4 1948 LR 75 IA 180 1308 ing to the office as to be inseparable from them then sanction under section 1971 would be necessary but if there was no necessary connection between them and the performance of those duties the official status furnishing only the occasion or opportunity for the acts then no sanction would be required.
There the law was laid down in the following terms The section has content and its language must be given meaning.
We have therefore first to concentrate on the word offence .
Now an offence seldom consists of a single act.
1309 urged on behalf of the respondent.
In Hori Ram Singh vs Emperor1 the medicines had not been entered in the stock book and were removed by the accused to his residence and the charge against him was that in so removing them he had committed MISappropriation.
An attempt to answer the question in a generalized way has been responsible for loose language used in some of the cases cited before us.
In Albert West Meads vs The King1 an Army Officer had received two sums of money and was subsequently unable to produce them.
3 1948 LR 75 IA 41.
Clearly therefore sanction was required under section 1971 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before the appellant could be prosecuted under section 409 and the absence of such sanc tion is fatal to the maintainability of the prosecution.
