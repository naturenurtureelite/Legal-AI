Both of them are dead.
Jaya was married to Kalbagal Junior.
429 Respondents 2 to 5 have not appeared in the proceedings.
According to her the gift deed exhibit D did not provide for devolution of interest by survivorship she pleaded that Lakshmamma had transferred all her interests in the properties comprised in the gift deed in favour of her husband Sadagopalachar who then became their sole owner.
She contended that the will had been brought into existence through the machinations of the appellant and she disputed the appellant s right to bring the present suit.
Against this decree respondent I preferred an appeal in the High Court of Mysore and the appellant filed cross objections.
The High Court thought that the learned trial judge had not fully considered all the material bearing on this point and so was in error in holding that at the relevant date Lakshmamma had a subsisting interest in half the share even in the suit properties items 1 and 2.
The appellant then applied for and obtained a certificate from the High Court that the decision under 433 appeal is one of reversal and it involves a claim respecting properties of the value of not less than Rs 20000.
The appellant however did not find time to get the will written.
The appellant had the draft in his hand from which he dictated to the scribe Chokkanna P W 3 who wrote the will.
