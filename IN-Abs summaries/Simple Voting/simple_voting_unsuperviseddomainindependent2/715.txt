iminal Appeal No 46 of 1957.
Hardayal Hardy for the appellants.
H J Umrigar and B H Dhebar for the respondent.
April 21.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR J.
The Chief Presidency Magistrate acquitted all the accused including the appellants and held that as the conciliation proceedings had continued for a period of more than 14 days as from January 17 1952 further proceedings for conciliation were illegal and therefore the accused persons could not be convicted under section 311of the Act.
The State took an appeal to the High Court and the judgment of acquittal was reversed and of the accused persons the two appellants were convicted and the others were acquitted.
The question for decision is whether the conciliation proceedings could be said to be pending when Louis Pereira was dismissed.
Section 331 pro K vides section 331  During the pendency of any conciliation proceedings before a conciliation officer or a Board or of any proceeding before a Labour Court or Tribunal or National Tribunal in respect of an industrial dispute no employer shall a in regard to any matter connected with the dispute alter to the prejudice of the workmen concerned in such dispute the conditions of service applicable to them immediately before the commencement of such proceedings or b for any misconduct connected with the dispute discharge or punish whether by dismissal or otherwise any workmen concerned in such dispute save with the express permission in writing of the authority before which the proceeding is pending .
Therefore the question reduces itself to the meaning of the words  pendency of any conciliation proceedings before a conciliation officer .
From this it was submitted that as 14 days had expired before March 18 1952 the dismissal could not be said to be one within the words  pendency of conciliation proceedings .
The appeal is therefore dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
