Sub article 2 of Article 124 further provides that every Judge of the Supreme Court shall be appointed by the President by warrant under his hand and seal after consultation with such of the Judges of the Supreme Court and of the High Courts in the States as the President may deem necessary for the purpose and shall hold office until he attains the age of sixty five years.
The power to punish a High Court Judge if one may so describe it is to be found only in article 2 18 read with article 1244 and 5 of the Constitu tion under which a Judge of the High Court can be removed from his office by an order of the President passed after an address by each House of Parliament supported by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less then two thirds of the members of that House present and voting has been presented to the President in the same session for such removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity.
The question therefore arises who is the author ity competent to grant sanction.
The only mode of removal of a Judge from his office on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity is laid down in clauses 4 and 5 of Article 124.
