minal Appeals Nos.
The appeals and the confirmation proceedings in the High Court were heard by M section Ali Khan and V R Deshpande JJ.
On the question of sentence he considered that the death sentences on the three appellants Pandurang Tukia and Bhilia should be maintained and that those of the other two should be commuted to transportation for life.
The petition was heard by Ali Khan and Reddy JJ.
and they made the following order The circumstances of the crime in this case were such that a brutal murder had been committed and sentence of death was the only one legally possible for the Sessions Judge to have passed and it was confirmed by the High Court.
Pandurang Tukia and Bhilia who were sentenced to death applied here for special leave to appeal.
On 7 12 1950 about 3 o clock in the afternoon Ramchander Shelke the deceased went to his field known as Bhavara with his wife s sister Rasika Bai PW1 and his servant Subhana Rao PW7.
Anyway Rasika Bai heard shouts from that direction so she ran to the river bank with Subhana and they both say that they saw all five accused attacking Ramchander with axes and sticks.
Ordinarily we would not have enquired into questions of fact but as three persons have been sentenced to death on the opinion of the third Judge despite the opinion of one that the death sentence should not be imposed and of the other that the appellants are not guilty and so should be acquitted we have deemed it advisable to examine the evidence.
They say they saw all five accused striking him the three appellants Pandurang Tukia and Bhilia with axes the other two who have not appealed with sticks.
The important thing is that both witnesses are agreed on the following points 1 that Tukia struck Ramchander on his cheek 1087 Rasika Bai adds that he also struck him on the head 2 that Pandurang hit him on the head 3 that after these blows Ramchander fell down and then Bhilia hit him on the neck.
Rasika Bai s version is that on seeing the assault she called out to the accused not to hit but they  raised their axes and sticks and threatened her and then ran away.
The dates of arrest and committal respectively in the case of each are as follows Bhilia 9 1 1951 and 14 6 1951 Tukia 13 10 1951 and 10 1 1952 Pandurang 31 8 1951 and 10 1 1952 Tukaram 13 4 1951 and 29 9 1951 Nilia 13 10 1951 and 10 1 1952 The main attack on this evidence was directed to the fact that neither the accused nor the eye witnesses are named in the First Information Report.
