Delay condoned.
The constitutional validity of section 151a of the Punjab Preemption Act 1913 was challenged on the ground that it offended the fundamental right guaranteed by Article 191f m Ram Sarup vs Munshi  Ors A Constitution Bench of this Court upheld the validity holding that there was no infringement of Article 1911  of the Constitution.
Thereafter a host of writ petitions 122 were filed in this Court under Article 32 of the Constitu tion challenging the constitutional validity of section 15 on the ground that it infringed Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution.
It may be mentioned that the mother State the State of Punjab had repealed the Act in 1973 but it contin ued to be in force in the State of Haryana which prior to 1966 was a part of the State of Punjab.
Section 15 of the 1913 Act as it originally stood underwent substantial changes in 1960 and as amended read as under 15.
This Court therefore upheld the constitutional validity of clause fourthly of section 151a clauses fourthly  and fifthly  of section 151b and clause fourthly of section 151c as valid and not infringing Articles 14 or 15 of the Constitution This Court however did not find any justification for the classification contained m section 15 which conferred a right of pre emption on the kinsfolk.
The right of preemption based on consanguinity was held to be a relic of the feudal past totally inconsistent with the constitutional philosophy and scheme.
It also found the list of kinsfolk entitled to pre emption as intrinsically defec tive and Self contradictory.
