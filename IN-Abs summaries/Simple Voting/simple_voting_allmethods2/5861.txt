Writ Petition No 4211 of 1983.
It is said that it would be violative of the Constitutional right of equal pay for equal work.
The State Government accepted the recommendations.
Section Officers have to prepare a lengthy and original notes in complicated and important matters.
Therefore the responsibilities of the two posts cannot be said to be equal.
the pay scale recommended by the Pay Rationalisation Committee the nature of duties and responsibilities and the fact that every Hon ble Judge will have one Private Secretary in the scale of Rs500 1000 we feel that the Bench Secretaries cannot be given the same scale of pay which is being given to Superintendents or the Section Officers.
 It will be seen that the Pay Commission refused to equate Bench Secretaries with Section Officers in view of their differential duties.
 The Anomalies Committee also thus rejected the claim of Bench Secretaries for placing them at par with Section Officers.
