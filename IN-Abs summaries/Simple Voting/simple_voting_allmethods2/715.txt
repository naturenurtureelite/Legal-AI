The Chief Presidency Magistrate acquitted all the accused including the appellants and held that as the conciliation proceedings had continued for a period of more than 14 days as from January 17 1952 further proceedings for conciliation were illegal and therefore the accused persons could not be convicted under section 311of the Act.
The two appellants have appealed by special leave.
The question for decision is whether the conciliation proceedings could be said to be pending when Louis Pereira was dismissed.
