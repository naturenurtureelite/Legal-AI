DN Mukherjee for the respondent in CA No 931 of 1965 and the appellant in CA No 1149 of 1965.
These appeals arise out of an election to a seat in the West Bengal Legislative Assembly from the Khargram Murshidabad constitutency reserved for members of the Scheduled Castes.
The contestants at this election were Abhoy Pada Saha and Sudhir Kumar Mondal.
Sudhir is admittedly a member of a Scheduled Caste.
The objection was rejected by the Returning Officer.
At the hearing of the petition by the Election Tribunal however he challenged the election only on the ground that Abhoy Pada was a member of the Saha caste and not a member of a Scheduled Caste.
Sudhir then appealed to the High Court at Calcutta which reversed the decision of the Tribunal and declared the election of Abhoy Pada invalid and set it aside on the ground that he did not belong to a Scheduled Caste.
In his petition Sudhir had further claimed that he should be declared elected in the place of the appellant if the latter s election was found to be invalid.
In the election petition the respondent had stated that the appellant was a member of the Saha caste and not a member of any Schedule Caste.
