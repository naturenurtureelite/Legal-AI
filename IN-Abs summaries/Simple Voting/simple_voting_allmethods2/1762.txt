Appeals Nos 884 887 of 1962.
Appeals from the judgment and decree dated May 2 1960 of the Rajasthan High Court in Civil Second Appeal Nos.
March 12 1964.
These four appeals arise out of four certi ficates granted by the High Court of Rajasthan and raise a common question.
The suit out of which appeal No 887 has arisen was filed by the respondent against the State of Rajasthan.
The respondent however was not able to export the entire quantity of 15000 maunds for which the permit was granted he could only export 4572 maunds and 20 seers of chuni before December 2 1947.
By May 15 1949 the United State of Rajasthan was formed including the Matsya Union into which the former State of Dholpur had merged on March 17 1948.
The United State of Rajasthan eventually became the Part B State of Rajasthan on January 26 1950 when the Constitution came into force.
It was a new sovereign and was not bound by any obligation against the old sovereign of the former State of Dholpur unless it chose to recognise the obligation.
In reply to this contention of the State the respondent relied on article 2952 of the Constitution and other provisions made during the period when mergers were taking place after August 15 1947 and contended that in view of article 2952 of the Constitution the State of Rajasthan was bound by the obligation of the former State of Dholpur.
In March 1949 the United State of Rajasthan was formed by Covenant entered into by fourteen Rulers of Rajasthan including these who had formed the Former State of Rajasthan.
Otherwise we see no sense or purpose in continuing the old laws till they are altered or repeated if the intention was that the obligations and liabilities flowing from the continuance of the old laws would notwithstanding the Covenant not be assumed by the new State.
Appeals dismissed.
