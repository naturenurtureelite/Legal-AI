At the hearing of the petition by the Election Tribunal however he challenged the election only on the ground that Abhoy Pada was a member of the Saha caste and not a member of a Scheduled Caste.
In our view it was open to the respondent to show that the appellant belonged to the Saha caste group within the Sunri caste group and did not therefore belong to the Schedule Caste specified in item 40 as he claimed.
He also held that the evidence did not establish that the Sahas formed a sub caste strictly so called within the Sunri caste of a caste wholly independent of the Sunri caste.
Nobody disputes that.
If the correct interpretation of item 40 was as we think it was that Sahas were a caste group within the Sunri caste no question of Sahas being a distinct class independent of Sunris could arise.
For the same reason we are unable to agree with the interpretation of the High Court that the Sahas excluded were those Sunris who bore the surname Saha.
