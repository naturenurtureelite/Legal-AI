Petitions Nos.
Applications by respondent No 1 for revocation of the certificate granted by the Madras High Court on 15th October 1968 under article 1331a  b of the Constitution of India.
In appeals under the Letters Patent preferred by the second defendant.
Against the orders passed in the two appeals the plaintiffs applied for certificate under Arts1331a and 1331b of the Constitution.
The High Court observed that an order granting interim injunction is a final order as far as this Court is concerned determining the rights of parties within this lit or proceeding which is independent though ancillary to the suit and they were competent to grant the certificate.
Against that order an appeal was preferred to the Judicial Committee which was held not maintainable.
