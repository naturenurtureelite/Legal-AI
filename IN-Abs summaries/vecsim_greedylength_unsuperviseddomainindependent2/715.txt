From this it was submitted that as 14 days had expired before March 18 1952 the dismissal could not be said to be one within the words  pendency of conciliation proceedings .
It was contended that the conciliation proceedings should be held to terminate when the Conciliation Officer is required under section 126 of the Act to submit his report but the provisions of the Act above quoted do not support this contention as the termination of the conciliation proceedings is deemed to take place when the report is received by the appropriate Government.
The appeal is therefore dismissed.
