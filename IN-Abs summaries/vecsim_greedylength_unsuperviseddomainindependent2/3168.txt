Admittedly no general body meeting had been held and therefore the balance sheet and profit and loss account had not been laid before a general body meeting nor could it be so laid.
view that a person charged with an offence cannot rely on his default as an answer to the charge and so if he was responsible for not calling the general meeting he cannot be heard to say in defence to the charges brought against him that because the general meeting had not been called the balance sheet and profit and loss account could not be laid before it.
In that case the directors of a company were prosecuted under sections 325 and 1333 of the Companies Act 1913 for breaches of sections 32 and 131 of that Act for having knowingly and wilfully authorized the failure to file the summary of share capital for the year 1953 and being knowingly and wilfully parties to the failure to lay before the company in general meeting the balance sheet and profit and loss account as at March 31 1953.
Referring to the decision of the Bombay High Court in that case this Court pointed out that decision turned on section 134 of the Companies Act 1913 the language of which was to a certain extent different from the language used in sections 32 and 131 and refrained from going into the question whether the difference in language in section 134 on the one hand and sections 32 and 131 on the other made any difference to the decision of the case.
