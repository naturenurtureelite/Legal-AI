From the Judgment and Order dated 4 4 1973 of the Punjab and Haryana High Court at Chandigarh in RSA No 1482 of 1961.
No application was made by the appellant to bring on record his legal representatives within the period prescribed.
The High Court referred the question to the trial Court for enquiry and decision.
The High Court found no substance in the plea that the appellant had no knowledge about the date of the death of Som Dass and held that the appeal had abated and that there was no ground for setting aside the abatement.
The word interest  which is mentioned in this rule means interest in the property ie the subject matter of the suit and the interest is the interest of the person who was the party to the suit.
It was however contended on behalf of the respondent that there was no devolution of the interest in the subject matter of the suit on the death of Som Dass since there was no certainty as to the person who would be elected as mahant to succeed him.
He never set up any claim which was adverse to the Dera or its properties.
