2788 and 3188 which came to be allowed on April 5 1991.
It was only thereafter that the plaintiff filed the suit for restoration of his possession.
In the previous suit the relief for possession was not claimed whereas in the second suit the relief was for restoration of possession.
Sub section 2 of section 8 next provides that where any person as is referred to in section 4 deemed tenant has been evicted from the land on or after 1st July 1962 such person shall be entitled to recover immediate possession of the land in the manner prescribed by or under the Act unless the landlord proves that the termination of tenancy was in the manner authorised by section 9.
If a suit is filed to recover possession of agricultural land from a trespasser and no dispute arises the adjudication whereof is required to be done by the special machinery set up under the Act the Civil Court will continue to have jurisdiction.
If the defendant who is sued as a trespasser raises a plea of tenancy a question arises whether his plea of tenancy can be decided by the Civil Court as incidental to the grant of relief for possession or is the Civil Court precluded from deciding the same in view of section 7 read section 582 of the Act.
In the circumstances we are left with no alternative but to remit the matter to the Trial Court with a direction to follow the course that may be found appropriate in the fact situation arising out of the pleadings in this case and the nature of the questions required to be determined for grant or refusal of relief claimed in the suit.
