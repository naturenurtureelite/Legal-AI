There was no separate dearness allowance until January 1977 when it was introduced for the first time.
On the basis that a sum of Rs 150 per month was added to the pay of each Draughtsman and a sum of Rs 100 was added to the pay of every other workman who belonged to the Union staff the financial load would increase to Rs 922032 .
The original award was completed and signed by the Tribunal and it cannot be reopened now except for the limited purpose of Rule 31.
Reliance was placed on The Hindustan Times Ltd New Delhi vs Their Workmen where it was observed by this Court that dearness allowance should not 179 remain fixed at any figure but should be on a sliding scale in order to neutralise a portion of the increase in the cost of living.
The Tribunal in the present case considered the matter and found it sufficient and in accord with justice that the wage scales should be restructured with suitable increments provided therein.
If the pay of an employee does not coincide with any step in the revised pay scale and falls between two steps in the reclassified pay scales the basic pay of that employee shall be fixed at the step higher in the revised scale.
The omission of the words to each employee first after the figure Rs 150 and again after the figure Rs 100 was clearly an accidental slip or omission which the Tribunal was entitled to correct.
