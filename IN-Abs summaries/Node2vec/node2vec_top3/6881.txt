In that case also this Court held that the right of pre emption vested in co shar ers was a reasonable restriction on the right to hold acquire or dispose of property conferred by Article 1911 of the Constitution.
Where the sale is of a share out of joint land or property and is not made by all the co sharers jointly only the other co sharers and the tenants can exercise the right of pre emption.
Therefore the petition ers cannot claim the right of pre emption under clause Fourthly  We do not therefore find any substance in this contention  In the present case also the appellant seeks to exercise the right of pre emption as a co sharer ie father s broth er s son of the vendors.
Since this Court found certain intrinsic contradictions in the list of relatives covered by the first three clauses it saw no justification for the classification contained in the said provision conferring a right based on consanguinity and therefore struck down those clausesas discriminatory and violative of Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution.
We find it diffi cult to hold that the purport of the of Court s decision in Attam Prakash s case was to deny the right of pre emption to those relative or relatives of the vendor or vendors who were specified in the erstwhile first three clauses of section 151b even if they happen to be co sharers.
