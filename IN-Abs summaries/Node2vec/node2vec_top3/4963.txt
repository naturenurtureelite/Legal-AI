CSS Rao for the Respondent.
The expression net wealth is defined by cl.
The figure of net wealth of the assessee at the end of the previous year takes into account the financial activities of the assessee during that previous year.
The assets are not confined to cash.
Where the asset is an asset other than cash its value is determined pursuant to sub section.
In other words it would be the estimated open market value of the rights in the property which constitute the asset.
In this view of the matter we approve of the opinion expressed by the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Vedrevu Venkappa Rao supra 311 and in Commissioner of Wealth Tax AP I vs Pachigolla Narasimha Rao1 and the Calcutta High Court in Dipti Kumar Basu vs Commissioner of Wealth Tax West Bengal2 and hold that the view taken by the Orissa High Court in Commissioner of Wealth tax vs Vysyaraju Badreenarayana Moorthy Raju Orissa supra and by the Karnataka High Court in A T Mirji vs Commissioner of Wealth Tax Karnataka3 cannot be accepted.
In the result the question is answered in the affirmative in favour of the Revenue and against the assessee.
