AS Nambiar and KR Nambiar for the Appellant.
PW 3 the Principal of the training school issued exhibit P 2 show cause notice to the PW 1 Venkataswamy the canteen contractor as to why his licence for running the canteen should not be cancelled.
The appellant produced the currency notes.
Finally the appellant was chargesheeted.
At the trial the prosecution witnesses supported the case.
PW 1 affirmed the fact that the appellant made the demand and had also received the amount on 2210.
The decisions of the Court in State of Rajasthan vs Mohamed Habeeb  CI Ernden vs State of Uttar Pradesh  and Lohana Kantilal vs State AIR 1954 Saurashtra 12 1 were referred to.
The case that has been developed in the course of the trial is not that of a loan transaction but payment of an advance of Rs 125 in the canteen when the appellant started to take food there.
It cannot therefore be said that there had been consistent explanation for the appellant.
P 2 memo had been issued on the basis of the complaint received from the appellant that on getting the explanation from PW 1 he on 18101975 itself passed orders and closed the file.
The words unless the contrary is proved  which occur in this provision make it clear that the presumption has to be rebutted by proof  and not by a bare explanation which is merely plausible.
A fact is said to be proved when its existence is directly established or when upon the material before it the Court finds its existence to be so probable that a reasonable man would act on the supposition that it exists.
 On a careful consideration of the facts and circum stances we are not satisfied that the appellant had even by preponderance of probability succeeded in rebutting the presumption.
We find no merit in the appeal.
NVK Appeal dismissed.
