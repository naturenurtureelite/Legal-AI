Section 33 of the Punjab Panchayat Samitis and Zilla Parishads Act 1961 The Act provided in so far as relevant that subject to rules made by the Government a Panchayat Samiti may employ such servants as it may consider necessary for the efficient performance of the duties imposed upon it by the Act rules or bye laws made thereunder or by.
He was confirmed in that post in course of time.
On January 21 1974 he was promoted as a Head Clerk on an ad hoc basis.
Section 13 of the Amending Act deleted section 33 of the Act.
A plain consequence of this deletion was that the Panchayat Samitis were divested of their power to make appointments to the Panchayats.
The appellant was appointed as a clerk by the Loharu Panchayat Samiti in 1963 long before the Amending Act came into force on June 13 1973.
Clearly it had fortified that right on June 13 1973.
It could not therefore have appointed the appellant as a Head Clerk as it purported to do in January 1974 on an ad hoc basis or in April 1975 on a regular basis.
He was appointed lawfully to the post of a Clerk and that is the post in which the Government has absorbed him.
