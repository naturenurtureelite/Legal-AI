Section 2vi as it stood at the relevant time provides inter alia that wages means all remuneration capable of being expressed in terms of money which would if the terms of the contract of employment express or implied were fulfilled be payable.
The terms in question need not be express and can be implied but they must be terms which arise out of the contract of employment and since an award made by an Industrial Tribunal cannot be said to amount to a contract of employment the wage structure prescribed by the award cannot fall within the definition prescribed by section 2vi.
That in brief is the substance of the argument raised by the appellant.
The development of industrial law during the last decade bears testimony to the fact that on references made under section 101 of the Industrial Disputes Act terms of employment have constantly been examined by industrial adjudication and wherever it appeared appropriate to make changes in them they have been made in accordance with the well recognised principles of fair play and justice to both the parties.
When an award is made and it prescribes a new wage structure in law the old contractual wage structure becomes inoperative and its place is taken by the wage structure prescribed by the award.
