 The impugned notice ran thus No 3245266 EC.
 It is clear from it that the petitioner attained the age of 50 years on 1021972 and therefore on the date of the order he had completed the age of 54 years.
 Strong reliance was placed by counsel for the petitioner on the reasons extracted above.
A person can be in Class I or Class II service or post even when he hold a post of either class substantively or temporarily or on officiating basis.
Officiating promotion certainly does not confer a right to the post and at any time the Government servant may be sent back to his substantive post.
Learned counsel for the petitioner does not dispute the position that a person who is in Class I or Class II service or post is in such service or post as covered by sub clause i.
If the condi tion indicated in sub clause i is satisfied namely the Government servant is in Class I or Class II service or post and he had entered into service before attaining the age of 35 years and has attained the age of fifty the further condition that he must substantively belong to the two classes of service or post cannot be introduced into the scheme.
It has been represented to us by counsel for the petitioner that the similarly placed persons had gone before the Delhi High Court challenging the orders of compulsory retirement and the Delhi High Court relying upon Tahiliani s case give them relief.
Even if the writ petition is allowed and the order of compulsory retirement is set aside the petitioner cannot go back to service.
