This order was amended on February 9 1955 in which it was stated that the aforesaid order should be read so as to show that the plaintiff was dismissed from service on account of charge of accepting illegal gratification from prisoner Ratilal Jivan having been conclusively proved against him in the departmental inquiries conducted against him by the Government.

This Court in State of Bihar vs Abdul Majid1 held that the rule of English Law that a civil servant cannot maintain a suit against the Crown for the recovery of arrears of salary does not prevail in India and it has been negatived by the provisions of the statute law in India.
The authorities citedgo no further than to say that when there is an engagement between the Crown and a military or naval officer the Crown is always entitled to determine it at pleasure and that no obligation contrary to that would be recognized or valid in law.
If the terms of the appointment definitely prescribe a term and expressly provide for a power to determine for cause it appears necessarily to follow that any implication of a power to dismiss at pleasure is excluded.
4 5 May 29 We are here concerned with a choice between section 60 and section 61 which lay down two broad categories.
RKPS Appeal dismissed.
