Indian Act.
263 there were six heads of income chargeable to income tax.
This section was introduced in 1922 before which under the Indian Act of 1918 a loss under one head of income could not be set off against income under another head the taxability of income arising from each head being separate.
Lord Macmillan in Madras  Southern Mahratta Railway Co vs Bezwada Municipality 3 laid down the sphere of a proviso as follows   The proper function of a proviso is to except and deal with a case which would otherwise fall within the general language of the main enactment and its effect is confined to that case.
Vide also Corporation of The City of Toronto vs Attorney General for Canada 1.
It is significant that in sections 213 and 5 of the Indian Act of 1918 corresponding to sections 215 and 6 of the Indian Act of 1922 the word used was income  which in the latter Act was expanded into  income profits and gains .
Counsel for the Revenue did not go to this extent that because profits were exempted losses could not be deducted his argument was that because before 1939 income was not chargeable unless it was received or accrued in British India therefore business in section 10 could only mean business in British India.
41950 5 269 argument does not take note of the definition of total income total world income  and chargeability of total income under section 3 or the provisions of section 4 where in the case of a resident total income  includes income profits and gains accruing within or without I British India.
But then it was said that as the profits or gains of business in an Indian State were exempted from payment of tax in British India business in section 10 must mean business in British India.
Appeals dismissed.
