In this petition under Article 32 of the Constitution they are seeking enforcement of their fundamental right to have equal pay for equal work.
Randhir Singh case was concerned with a driver constable in the Delhi Police Force under the Delhi Administration.
Meva Ram Kanojia is the most recent decision which has exhaustively dealt with all the principles bearing on the question of equal pay for equal work in the light of all the previous decisions of this Court.
One cannot deny that often the difference is a matter of degree and that there is an element of value judgment by those who are charged with the administration in fixing the scales of pay and other conditions of service.
So long as such value judgment is made bona fide reasonably on an intelligible criterion which has a rational nexus with the object of dif ferentiation such differentiation will not amount to discrimination.
In the light of the aforesaid principles we may now consider whether the equality claims of the petitioners could be allowed.
From the averments in the pleadings of the parties it will be clear that the Corporation has no regularly employed carpenters.
In the first place even assum ing that the petitioners  jobs are comparable with the counterparts in the government service the petitioners cannot enforce the right to equal pay for equal work.
A comparison cannot be made with counterparts in other establishments with different management or even in establishments in different geographical locations though owned by the same master.
Unless it is shown that there is a discrimination amongst the same set of employees by the same master in the same establishment the principle of equal pay for equal work cannot be enforced.
It requires the consideration of various dimensions of the job.
