We have already indicated when dealing with the history of the political changes which eventually culminated in the 181 Part B State of Rajasthan after the coming into force of the Constitution that two matters were always provided for there during all this process of merger.
Thus by continuing the old laws till they are repealed altered or modified the new State in effect undertook the liability which might arise against it by virtue of the continuance of the old laws Even if there was some doubt about the new State undertaking the liabilities of the old State in view of the continuance of the old laws we can in accordance with the decision in the Daltia Dadri Cement Co s case1 look to article VI of the Covenant to come to the conclusion that on continuing the old laws until they were altered repealed or modified the 1 1959 SCR 729.
This is the basic difference between the Dalmia Dadri Cement Company case1 and the present case for in that case the old laws were repealed and thus repudiated in areas other than Patiala State while in the present case the old laws were continued till they were repealed or altered and in view of that basic difference between that case and the present case we can legitimately call in aid article VI of the Covenant and similar provisions which were always made throughout this process of merger in Rajasthan and treat them as evidence from which to come to the conclusion that the new State by continuing the old laws without change till they were repealed or altered recognised that it was liable in the same way as would have been the merging State if there was any liability on the merging State.
