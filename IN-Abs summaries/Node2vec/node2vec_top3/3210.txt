Whether the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry New Delhi Respondent 1 is a commercial establishment within the meaning of s25 of the Delhi Shops and Establishments Act 1954 for short the Act is the sale question that falls for determination in this appeal by certificate directed against the judgment dated February 8 1967 of the High Court of Delhi.
They read Commercial establishment means any premises wherein any trade business or profession or any work in connection with or incidental or ancillary thereto is carried on and includes a society registered under the  and charitable or other trust whether registered or not which carries on any business trade or profession or work in connection with or incidental or ancillary thereto  journalistic and printing establishments quarries and mines not governed by the  educational or other Institutions run for private gain and premises in which business of banking insurance stocks and shares brokerage or produce exchange is carried on but does not include a shop or a factory registered under the  or theaters cinemas restaurants eating houses residential hotels clubs or other places of public amusement or entertainment.
Mr Pai learned Counsel for the Federation has firstly raised a preliminary objection that before the High Court at no stage it was urged on behalf of the Appellants that the activity of the Federation carried on in the premises was a business or trade.
It takes up with the concerned authorities the specific difficulties experienced by the trade in the day today business and endeavours to attain for the traders and industrialists those material advantages by unified action which they may not be able to achieve in their individual capacity.
It was condended that the activity of the Association was not a business or trade because by the Memorandum of Associ 1 357 ation all the property and income of the association were applicable solely to the promotion of the above objects and no part thereof could be paid as dividend or otherwise to any member.
For all the foregoing reasons particularly in view of the decision of this Court in R K Mittals case supra we would hold that the pre premises of the Federation are a commercial establishment within the meaning of section 25 of the Act.
