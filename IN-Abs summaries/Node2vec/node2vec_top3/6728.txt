Special Leave Petition Nos.
823 24 of 1990.
321  322 of 1989.
SR Bhat for the Petitioners.
RN Narasimha Murthy KH Nobin Singh M Veerappa and SN Bhatt for the Respondents.
The petitioners were the owners of certain lands which were acquired by the respondents under the provisions of Sections 17 and 19 of the Bangalore Development Act 1976 hereinafter referred to as the Bangalore Act.
Thus the award should have been made within two years from September 20 1984.
On September 11 1985 the petitioners obtained an interim order from this Court directing status quo with regard to the possession of the lands in question in Special Leave Petition No 294 of 1985 preferred against the order of the Karnataka High Court dated August 14 1984 with which we are not directly concerned here.
In these two writ petitions the Karnataka High Court granted interim stay of further proceedings in respect of the acquisition of the said lands.
Appeals against the decision of a learned Single Judge were dismissed by the Karnataka High Court on October 6 1989 by a Division Bench of that High Court.
Curiously enough there is no reference in the Special Leave Petitions to any to the stay orders and we came to know about these orders only when the respondents appeared in response to the notice and filed their counter affidavit.
In our view the said interim orders have a direct bearing on the question raised and the non disclosure of the same certainly amounts to suppression of material facts.
RP SLPs dismissed.
