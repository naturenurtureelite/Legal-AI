Civil No 548 of 1987.
Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India.
MC Dhingra for the Petitioners.
The petitioners are carpenters 1st and 2nd grade employed at the Wood Working Centre of the Himachal Pradesh State Handicrafts Corporation the Corpo ration.
They are termed as daily rated employees.
The case of the Corporation is that the unit where the petition ers are working is a factory registered under the Factories Act.
They are being paid the same wages as are payable to carpenters painters and carpenters  helpers engaged in the construction industry.
A little more information about the purpose and object of the Corporation would be useful for proper understanding of the case.
During the period of training the trainees are paid a stipend by the Corporation.
Apart from giving training the Corporation also ensures marketing support to the artisans and craftsmen by purchasing their products at remunerative prices and sell them through the marketing network of the Corporation.
But to avoid or minimise further loss it is stated that the Corporation has reduced its overheads and maintained only the administrative staff in the production centers at different parts of the State and no permanent craftsmen are employed.
There the Court pointed out that that principle has to be read into Article 14 of the Constitution which enjoins the State not to deny any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the law and also to Article 16 which declares that there should be equality of opportu nity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the State.
But the Court held that the principle of equal pay for equal work cannot be invoked invariably in every kind of service particularly in the area of professional services.
The principal claim of the petitioners therefore fails and is rejected.
