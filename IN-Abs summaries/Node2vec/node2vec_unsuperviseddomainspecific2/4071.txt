Civil Appeal Nos.
1617 and 1640A of 1979.
Appeals by Special Leave from the Judgment and order dated 20 1 1979 of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Misc.
Petition No 884 of 1978.
R P Bhatt and Sri Narain for the Appellant In CA 161779.
section K Gambhir for RR.
5 6 in CA 161779.
The final publication of the electoral roll under Rule 8 of the Rules was done on November 16 1978.
On December 30 1978 the learned Single Judge before whom the case came up for orders directed the issue of notice of the petition and the stay application to the respondents and issued an interim order directing the respondents not to notify the results of the election under Rule 46 of the Rules pending disposal of the petition.
On December 31 1978 the poll was held and 44 persons were declared elected.
Their names were however not published under Rule 46 of the Rules in view of the interim order made by the Court.
Thereafter the successful candidates were also impleaded as respondents and the petition was amended by the inclusion of an additional prayer that the declaration of the results of the election should also be quashed.
After the respondents filed their counter affidavits the petition was heard and it was dismissed by a Division Bench of the High Court on January 20 1979.
Aggrieved by the order passed by the High Court Ashok Kumar Mishra and Bhagwat Singh Thakur Petitioners No 1 and 5 respectively in the 494 petition before the High Court filed a petition for special leave to appeal to this Court and Purshottam Lal Sharma petitioner No 6 before the High Court filed another petition.
On special leave being granted the above petitions were registered as appeals.
They further pleaded that the authorities would have taken action to correct the error in the notice issued under Rule 41 of the Rules granting 20 days  time to prefer claims and objections if it had been brought to their notice by the petitioners immediately after it was noticed by them.
The period prescribed for preferring claims and objections under Rule 43 was 30 days.
It was also open to them to file a writ petition immediately after the publication of the said notice questioning its legality.
After November 25 1978 a large number of nominations were received by the Returning officer.
No satisfactory reason for the delay was set out in the petition.
We are not therefore impressed by the argument that the petitioners were entitled to the issue of the writ prayed for as of right and the delay in filing the petition should have been ignored.
We therefore find it unnecessary to deal with the other points urged before us.
