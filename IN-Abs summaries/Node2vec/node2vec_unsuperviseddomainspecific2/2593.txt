Appeal by special leave from the judgment and decree dated June 19 24 1963 of the Gujarat High Court in Appeal No 704 of 1960 from Appellate Decree.
This appeal by special leave arises out of the suit filed by Bhaishankar Avalram Joshi hereinafter referred to as the plaintiff for a declaration that the order of dismissal dated February 24 1955 passed by the Inspector General of Prisons Saurashtra was illegal and void on the ground that it contravened the provisions of article 311 2 of the Constitution.
The plaintiff appealed to the High Court claiming arrears of salary and the State of Bombay filed cross objections praying that the suit be dismissed.
The second appeal was heard by the High Court of Gujarat Miabhoy J who directed that the decree passed by the lower appellate court be varied so as to show that the appellant plaintiff continued to be in Government service till the date of the suit only and there will be a decree for Rs 2690 919 being arrears of pay due to the appellant plaintiff upto the date of the suit.
