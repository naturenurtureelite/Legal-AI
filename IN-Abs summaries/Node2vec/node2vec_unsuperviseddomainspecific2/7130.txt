The said suit was dismissed on Match 28 1974 on the ground that the plaintiff was no more in possession of the suit property and therefore a suit for a mere declaration simpliciter could not lie.
The Trial Court therefore held that the plaintiff was wrongly dispossessed by defendant No 1 in collusion with defendant No2 and decreed the suit for eviction on September 25 1985.
Against the said decree both the defendants preferred an appeal No 8285.
 7B to suction 2 which rendered the Civil Court without jurisdiction.
The court came to the conclusion that a mere declaration of his status as a tenant could not be granted unless the consequential relief for possession was prayed.
We are therefore of the opinion that the High Court was wrong in holding that the second suit was barred by res judicata.
When in the course of that suit it was found that the plaintiff had in fact been dispossessed there was no question of granting an injunction and the only relief which the court could have granted was in regard to the declaration sought which the court held could not be granted in view of the provisions of Specific Relief Act.
The cause of action for that suit was not on the premise that he had in fact been illegally and forcibly dispossessed and needed the court s assistance to be restored to possession.
Section 7 posits that if any question arises whether any person is a tenant or should be deemed to be a tenant under the Act the Mamlatdar shall after holding an enquiry decide such question.
It says that a tenant entitled to possession of any land under any of the provisions of the Act may apply in writing for such possession to the Mamlatdar.
