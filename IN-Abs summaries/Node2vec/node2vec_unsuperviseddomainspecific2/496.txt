The appeals and the confirmation proceedings in the High Court were heard by M section Ali Khan and V R Deshpande JJ.
They differed.
The former considered that the convictions should be maintained but was of opinion that the sentence in each case should be commuted to imprisonment for life.
The petition was heard by Ali Khan and Reddy JJ.
Leave to appeal was refused.
Pandurang Tukia and Bhilia who were sentenced to death applied here for special leave to appeal.
Rasika Bai started to pick chillies in the field while Ramehander went to another field Vaniya che seth which is about a furlong away.
They say they saw all five accused striking him the three appellants Pandurang Tukia and Bhilia with axes the other two who have not appealed with sticks.
On hearing this he wrote out 1088 a report exhibit No 4 and sent it to the Police Station at Udgir which is about six miles from the scene of the murder.
Tukia s conviction under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code was therefore jusified.
Accordingly there must have been a prior meeting of minds.
There was evidence that they all ran away together not simply that they ran away at the same moment of time when discovered but that they ran away together.
