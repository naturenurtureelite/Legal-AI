Ms Tarapore  Company hereinafter called the plaintiffs applied in Suit No 118 of 1967 for an interim injunction restraining the Bank of India Ltd the first defendant in the suit from taking any steps in pursuance of a letter of credit opened in favour of Ms VO Tractors Export Moscow the second defendant.
the High Court of Madras set aside that order.
Against the orders passed in the two appeals the plaintiffs applied for certificate under Arts1331a and 1331b of the Constitution.
We set out the reasons in support of that order.
 The suit filed by the plaintiffs is a civil proceeding and the suit involves some claim or question respecting property of not less than twenty thousand rupees.
In the present case not even an issue has been decided and it is not contended that the order of the High Court amounts to a judgment or a decree.
 In Abdul Rahman vs.
2 3 4 5 LR 60 IA 76.
In Abdul Rahman s case1 a suit was instituted by DK Cassim and Sons claiming damages against the appellant Abdul Rahman.
Soon after the suit was instituted the plaintiff firm was adjudicated insolvent and the official assignee was impleaded as an additional plaintiff.
Against that order an appeal was preferred to the Judicial Committee which was held not maintainable.
76 2 3 4 703 communication passed by the appellant religious head of a community was invalid.
The trial court decided the issue against the appellant and the order was confirmed in appeal by the High Court of Bombay.
There is therefore abundant authority in support of the view that an order is final within the meaning of article 133 of the Constitution under section 109 Code of Civil Procedure or section 205 of the Government of India Act 1935 if it amounts to final decision on the rights of the parties in dispute in the suit or proceeding if after the order is made the suit or proceeding still remains to be tried and the rights in disputes have to be determined the order is interlocutory.
