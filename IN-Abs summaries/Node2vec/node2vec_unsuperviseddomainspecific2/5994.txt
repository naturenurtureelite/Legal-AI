The civil appeal by speci al leave and the connected SLP raise an important issue as to the power of the Central Administration Tribun al Tribunal to examine the adequacy of penalty awarded by the competent authority to a Government servant in discipl i nary proceedings.
The question which has to be decided therefore is whether the Tribunal has power to modify the penalty award ed to the respondent when the findings recorded as to h is misdemeanour is supported by legal evidence.
Section 15 deals with the simil ar power and authority of the State Administrative Tribuna l Section 16 refers to the powers of a Joint Administrati ve Tribunal.
The powers of other ordina ry civil courts in relation to service matters to try all sui ts of a civil nature excepting suits of which their cognizan ce either expressly or impliedly barred also stand conferred on the Tribunal.
1 9 the Tribunal can exercise any of the powers of a civ il court or High Court.
Mr Ashri learned counsel for t he respondent however justified the discretion exercised by the Tribunal in awarding the lesser punishment.
The High Court observed That the findings in respect of charges la and le 29 should be set aside as being opposed to the rules of natur al justice but the findings in respect of charges lc a nd ld and charge 2 need not be disturbed.
On the other hand an order bas ed on several grounds some of which are found to be non exis t ent or irrelevant can be sustained if the court is sati s fied that the authority would have passed the order on t he basis of the other relevant and existing grounds and t he exclusion of the irrelevant or non existent grounds cou ld not have affected the ultimate opinion or decision.
The appellant was a low paid class IV Governme nt servant.
It may be noted that this Court exercised the equit a ble jurisdiction under Article 136 and the High Court or Tribunal has no such power or jurisdiction.
