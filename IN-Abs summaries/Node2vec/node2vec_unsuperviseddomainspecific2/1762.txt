Appeals from the judgment and decree dated May 2 1960 of the Rajasthan High Court in Civil Second Appeal Nos.
section K Kapur and B R G K Achar for the appellant in allthe appeals.
Before we refer to the decisions of the courts below with regard to this controversy it would be convenient to clear the ground by indicating the admitted position which resulted in the inclusion of the former Dholpur State into the Part B State of Rajasthan which came into existence on January 26 1950 and which would be bound by article 2952 of the Constitution.
There was also a provision in the Covenant by which the assets and liabilities of the covenanting States became the assets and liabilities of the new State.
182 new State intended to affirm the rights of the subjects which they had against the merging State and to assume itself the liability if any arising against the merging State.
This is the basic difference between the Dalmia Dadri Cement Company case1 and the present case for in that case the old laws were repealed and thus repudiated in areas other than Patiala State while in the present case the old laws were continued till they were repealed or altered and in view of that basic difference between that case and the present case we can legitimately call in aid article VI of the Covenant and similar provisions which were always made throughout this process of merger in Rajasthan and treat them as evidence from which to come to the conclusion that the new State by continuing the old laws without change till they were repealed or altered recognised that it was liable in the same way as would have been the merging State if there was any liability on the merging State.
