In Criminal Appeals Nos 92 and 93 of 1954.
P A Mehta and P G Gokhale for the respondent.
December 3.
Five persons including the three appellants were prosecuted for the murder of one Ram chander Shelke.
Leave to appeal was refused.
The other two have not appealed.
Anyway Rasika Bai heard shouts from that direction so she ran to the river bank with Subhana and they both say that they saw all five accused attacking Ramchander with axes and sticks.
Two other persons Laxman PW6 and Elba PW5 who were in the neighbourhood also heard the cries and ran to the spot.
It is said that there is some discrepancy between Rasika Bai s statement in the Sessions Court and in the Committal Court about the order in which the blows were given and their number.
Opposite the column headed Name and address of the complainant or informant is entered Tukaram so Panda Sheolka.
In that he is not right though the mistake is natural enough because exhibit 4 merely places Tukaram s name opposite the printed column headed complainant or informant.
On a careful consideration of the evidence we think Rasika and Subhana are telling the truth and that they can be relied on.
Rasikabai says that the accused raised their axes and sticks and threatened her when she called out to them but that again is an all embracing statement which we are not prepared to take literally in the absence of further particulars.
