170 The Union filed a statement before the Tribunal claiming an upward revision of the wage scales and dearness allowance and an increase from fifteen years to twenty years in the span for earning annual increments.
It was pointed out that the dearness allowance and house rent allowance granted by the appellant made little impact in neutralising the cost of living.
171 in this connection it proceeded on the footing that the appellant was a separate and independent division of Tata Sons Limited and had no functional integrality with the other divisions.
Record Keeper Veh.
 The jurisdiction given to the Tribunal by rule 31 is closely circumscribed.
In the circumstances the order of 22nd December 1978 is invalid so far as it amends paragraph 23 of the original award.
We also agree with him that Civil Appeal No 2299 of 1979 should also be dismissed in so far as it relates to the award dated December 20 1978.
ii Employees who have completed 4 years of service as on 1st January 1976 2 increments.
iii All other employees with more than one year s service shall be given one increment.
