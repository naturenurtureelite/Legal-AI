R Nagarathnam for the Appellant.
After the ninth day the mother and child according to customary practice were taken by the mother of the deceased to her house at Krishna Kalva.
On 18th December 1972 according to the case of the prosecution the accused once again requested his mother in law to send his wife to his house.
After completing the investigation the Police laid a chargesheet against the accused and he was duly tried.
He commented on the failure of the Police to seize the mat or bedding on which the deceased was sleeping.
He submitted that the version of the accused that the occurrence took place at about 10 pm was substantiated by what was mentioned in exhibit P 15 the wound certificate given by PW 13 the Medical officer in respect of the injuries which he found on the person of the accused.
We do not think that an injury of the nature received by the deceased could have been caused in the manner suggested by the accused.
It is obvious that he must have been upset by the persistent refusal of the brother and mother of the deceased to send her with him to his house.
At the worst the so called improvement made by her may be rejected but no more.
At one time it was thou ht that an order of acquittal could be set aside for substantial and compelling reasons only and Courts used to launch on a search to discover those substantial and compelling reasons.
But fanciful and remote possibilities must be left out of account.
