Appeal No 381 of 1966.
The suggestion is that as the licence of Ms T T Krishnamachari  Sons was revoked and as they were not even given sole selling agency for the sale of the products of barium chemicals Mr T T Krishnaniachari wanted action to be taken under this provision either for penalising appellant No 1 or putting pressure on it.
We were however not impressed by this argument.
We would however like to refer to and deal with one aspect of the argument bearing on the question of mala fides.
In this paragraph Mr Dutt has admitted some of the facts stated in paragraphs 1 to 19.
b of the section may have been committed.
Though the order could successfully be challenged if it were made mala fide it has not been shown to have been so made.
The action of the Chairman was and is challenged on diverse grounds but those which were presented before us were few and clear cut.
The action is challenged as without jurisdiction because not the Board but the Chairman alone acted as mala fide because no honest opinion was formed on the matters which under the section give rise to the power but on irrelevant and extraneous material and further because the order was passed under the influence and malice of a Minister of Cabinet who was interested in another Company belonging to his sons and sought this means to oust a rival.
1 of section 637 read with sub section.
The matter was then placed before the Chairman who formed the opinion that there were circum stances suggesting the need for action under section 237b.
that some directors have resigned does not establish fraud or misconduct.
In my opinion the distribution of the business of the Board among its members is a delegation of its authority.
