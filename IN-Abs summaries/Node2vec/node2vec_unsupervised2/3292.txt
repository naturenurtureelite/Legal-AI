From the Judgment and Order dated 4 4 1973 of the Punjab and Haryana High Court at Chandigarh in RSA No 1482 of 1961.
Kapil Sibbal and D Probir Mitra for respondents.
This is an appeal by special leave against a decree passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana holding that the appeal filed by the plaintiff appellant has abated and dismissing his suit.
The appellant had raised an alternative contention before the High Court that there was no abatement of the appeal even if Som Dass was not impleaded within the period prescribed as he claimed to represent the dera as its duly elected Chela.
As already stated the contention of the defendant was that though the properties belonged to the Dera he was its lawfully appointed mahant and that the appellant had no right to recover possession of the property of the Dera.
The suit against Som Dass was not in his personal capacity but in his capacity as de facto mahant.
In other words the suit was for possession and management of the Dera and the properties appertaining to it by the appellant purporting to be the de jure mahant against Som Dass as de facto mahant.
