Civil Appeal No 1433 of 1977 Appeal by Special leave from the Judgment and Order dated the 16th February 1977 of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Civil Writ Petition No 752 of 1977.
JD Jain  Mrs Kawaljit Kocher for the Appellant.
Harbans Lal IS Goel  RN Poddar for the Respondent.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRACHUD CJ.
He was confirmed in that post in course of time.
the Panchayat.
Since the appellant according to the terms and conditions of his service with the Panchayat was entitled to be considered for promotion to the post of a Head Clerk his appointment as a Head Clerk prior to his absorption in Government service had to be recognised and protected despite the fact that such appointment was made after June 13 1973 when the Amending Act came into force.
Clearly it had fortified that right on June 13 1973.
It could not therefore have appointed the appellant as a Head Clerk as it purported to do in January 1974 on an ad hoc basis or in April 1975 on a regular basis.
The appointment of the appellant to the post of a Head Clerk being without the authority of law the Government was not bound to absorb him in the post of a Head Clerk.
For these reasons the appeal fails and is dismissed.
