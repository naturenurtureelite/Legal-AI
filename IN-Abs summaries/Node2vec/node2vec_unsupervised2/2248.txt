Appeal No 1375 of 1966.
Appeal from the judgment and order dated October 22 1965 of the Bombay High Court Nagpur Bench in Special Civil Application No 355 of 1964.
On July 14 1961 the Panchayat passed resolution No 2 with a view to levy octroi duty.
After setting out the previous resolutions and the publication of the notice by beat of drum and the various objections received it concludes Having considered all these above objections and suggestions and having given a satisfactory explanation for the same this Committee unanimously resolves that as per the above resolution octroi should be levied on all the goods coming into the limits of the Panchayatas per schedule I item 1and levy the minimum octroi as per the rules in Schedule I item 2.
On April 6 1964 the Standing Committee allowed the appeal of the Company on two grounds first that it was necessary for the Panchayat to have the octroi limits fixed with the approval of the Collector before levying octroi under r 21 and secondly that the Company was not importing tea within the limits of the Panchayat for consumption use or sale.
Rule 71 which deals with tax on professions also contains a reference to rr 3 and 4.
The learned counsel for the Panchayat contends that these things are done and that the resultant product is completely different from the tea imported into octroi limits.
