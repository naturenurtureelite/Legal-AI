Appeal by special leave from the judgment and decree dated June 19 24 1963 of the Gujarat High Court in Appeal No 704 of 1960 from Appellate Decree.
P K Chatterjee and section P Nayar for the appellant.
I N Shroff for respondent No 1.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Sikri J.
The plaintiff failed before the Civil Judge Rajkot but on appeal succeeded before the District Judge Central Saurashtra inasmuch as he declared order dated February 24 1955 illegal and void.
On March 25 1954 he was suspended and at that time he was acting as Accountant at Rajkot Central Jail.
He was also allowed to appear through an Advocate in the enquiry proceedings.
