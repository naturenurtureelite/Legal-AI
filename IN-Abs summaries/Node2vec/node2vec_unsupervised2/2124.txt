Sudhir is admittedly a member of a Scheduled Caste.
The Election Tribunal rejected this contention and dismissed the petition.
He challenges the validity of the order of the High Court setting aside his election.
article 332 of the Constitution provides that seats shall be reserved for the Scheduled Castes in the Legislative Assembly of every State.
In our view it was open to the respondent to show that the appellant belonged to the Saha caste group within the Sunri caste group and did not therefore belong to the Schedule Caste specified in item 40 as he claimed.
He held that the Sahas formed a group within the Sunri caste be it a sub caste strictly so called or other 390 wise.
The learned Judge therefore held that as the appellant bore the surname Saha he did not belong to the Scheduled Caste specified in item 40 though he was a Sunri.
LS5SCI 27 392 If we are right in our interpretation of item 40 then the only question that has to be decided in this case is whether the respondent has established that the appellant belonged to a smaller caste group called Sahas within the Sunri caste.
