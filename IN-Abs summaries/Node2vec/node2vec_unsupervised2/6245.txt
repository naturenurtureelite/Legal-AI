RK Garg SP Singh NM Popli RB Misra Uma Nath Misra and RC Kaushik for the Appellants.
After the written examina tion was over on the basis of the results thereof success ful candidates upto a base limit have to be called to be interviewed.
When this position was known and upon an inquiry was factually estab lished the Public Service Commission decided to cancel the entire recruitment examination and asked for re holding of it.
On the other hand the situation could have been appropriately met by setting aside the recruitment and asking for a 126 fresh interview of all eligible candidates on the basis of the written examination and select those who on the basis of the written and the freshly held interview became eligible for selection.
In lieu thereof we direct that the results of the written examination shall stand sustained and shall form the basis for the interview part of the recruitment and on the basis of the two examinations and in terms of the recruit ment rules fresh selections shall be made.
