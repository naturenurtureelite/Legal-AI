From the Judgment and Order dated 1651988 of the Punjab  Haryana High Court in Regular Second Appeal No 3648 of 1987.
SNMishra LK Gupta DK Yadav and DKGarg for the Respondents.
Delay condoned.
The constitutional validity of section 151a of the Punjab Preemption Act 1913 was challenged on the ground that it offended the fundamental right guaranteed by Article 191f m Ram Sarup vs Munshi  Ors A Constitution Bench of this Court upheld the validity holding that there was no infringement of Article 1911  of the Constitution.
Section 15 of the 1913 Act as it originally stood underwent substantial changes in 1960 and as amended read as under 15.
The right of pre emption in regard to a co sharer was upheld on the consideration that if an outsider is introduced as a co sharer in a property it will make common management extremely difficult and destroy the benefits of ownership in common.
In that case also this Court held that the right of pre emption vested in co shar ers was a reasonable restriction on the right to hold acquire or dispose of property conferred by Article 1911 of the Constitution.
We therefore do not approve the ratio of Jagdish s case and overrule the same.
If the respondent No 1 fails to do so the Court shall appoint a Commissioner who shall execute the conveyance on behalf of the respondent No 1 and the Court shall put the appellant in possession of the suit land.
