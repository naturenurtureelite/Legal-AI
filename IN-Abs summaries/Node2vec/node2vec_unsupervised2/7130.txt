The plaintiffs case in the plaint was that he was the lessee in respect of seven lots on an annual rent of Rs 3600 payable in advance in three instalments that he had paid the rent upto the end of December 1967 and the first installment of 1968 but the owner defendant No 2 in collusion with defendant No 1 executed a deed of lease in favour of the latter effective from January 1 1968 on the strength whereof defendant No 1 claimed to have assumed possession of the property sometime in the second week of June 1968 without his tenancy having been lawfully terminated.
The High Court in the backdrop of these facts came to the conclusion that the subject matter of the second suit was directly and substantially in issue in the previous suit between the same parties and hence regardless of the relief claimed the second suit was clearly barred by res judicata.
In that suit the issue regarding the status of the plaintiff as a lessee was not settled once for all and hence that issue could not be stated to be barred by res judicata in the subsequent suit brought by the lessee for possession the demised property.
Even in cases of threatened wrongful possession section 8A says that any tenant in possession of any land or dwelling house who apprehends that he may be dispossessed contrary to the provisions of this Act may apply in the prescribed manner to the Mamlatdar for an order safeguarding his right to possession.
It says that a tenant entitled to possession of any land under any of the provisions of the Act may apply in writing for such possession to the Mamlatdar.
