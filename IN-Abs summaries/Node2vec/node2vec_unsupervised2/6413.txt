 Criminal Appeal No 8 18 of 1979.
A No 4 of 1977.
AS Nambiar and KR Nambiar for the Appellant.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by FATHIMA BEEVI J.
PW 1 handed over the money to the appellant who received the same.
PW 3 the Principal produced the concerned file relating to show cause notice from the house of the appellant on the same day.
Finally the appellant was chargesheeted.
At the trial the prosecution witnesses supported the case.
The plea of the appellant was that PW 1 had returned the amount due to him and there had been no demand for a bribe as there had been no occasion for doing so.
Before the High Court the contentions of the appellant were that there was no independent evidence regarding the demand the messenger who had contacted PW 1 at the 337 behest of the appellant had not been examined the solitary evidence of PW 1 is insufficient the explanation offered by the appellant was probable and there is no conclusive evi dence to hold that the appellant.
The appellant has reiterated the contentions before us.
It cannot therefore be said that there had been consistent explanation for the appellant.
P 2 memo had been issued on the basis of the complaint received from the appellant that on getting the explanation from PW 1 he on 18101975 itself passed orders and closed the file.
He had thereafter received the amount of Rs 100 from PW 1.
A fact is said to be proved when its existence is directly established or when upon the material before it the Court finds its existence to be so probable that a reasonable man would act on the supposition that it exists.
Unless there fore the explanation is supported by proof the presumption created by the provision cannot be said to be rebutted.
 On a careful consideration of the facts and circum stances we are not satisfied that the appellant had even by preponderance of probability succeeded in rebutting the presumption.
It is accordingly dismissed.
NVK Appeal dismissed.
