The Judgment of the Court was delivered by JAGANNATHA SHETTY J.
The report did not accept the claim of Bench Secretaries for giving them pay scale equal to Section Officers or Private Secretaries.
Keeping in view the present scale of pay.
article l4 permits reasonable classification founded on different basis.
Functions may be the same but the responsibilities make a difference.
If it has a rational nexus with the object to be sought for as reiterated before a certain amount of value judgment of the administrative authorities who are charged with fixing the pay scales has to be left with them and it cannot be interfered with by the Court unless it is demonstrated that either it is irrational or based on no basis or arrived mala fide either in law or in fact.
Under the rules framed by the Chief Justice of the High Court Bench Secretaries Grade I are selected by a Selection Committee.
SL Appeal allowed.
