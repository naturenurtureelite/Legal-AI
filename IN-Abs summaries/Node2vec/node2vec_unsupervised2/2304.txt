156 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Hegde J.
Under the Government of India Act 1935 the power to transfer a district judge from one post to another was that of the Governor though that power was always exercised in consultation with the High Court and by and large on the recommendation of the High Court.
Consequently the sessions divisions of Ganjam Boudh Mayurbhanj Keonjhar and Bolangir Kalahandi were without district and sessions judges for several days.
As mentioned earlier member sales tax tribunal was an ex cadre post.
It is not the case of the parties that he was placed at the disposal of the government for any definite period.
AS seen earlier he was holding the post in question ever since 1962In those circumstances the High Court was entitled to recall him and post him as a district and sessions judge.
Before considering the correctness of that submission it is necessary to notice that this argument breaks down when we come to the question of filling up the post of the Registrar.
Now let us consider the ratio of the decisions in Nripendra Nath Bagchi s case 1 and Ranga Mahammad s 2 case.
For however well meaning a Minister may be he can never possess the same intimate knowledge of the working of the judiciary as a whole and of individual Judges as the High Court.
A decision is only an authority for what it actually decides.
In other words the period during which a judicial officer should serve in an executive post must be settled by agreement between the High Court and the government.
If there is no such agreement it is open to the government to send him back to his parent department at any time it pleases.
