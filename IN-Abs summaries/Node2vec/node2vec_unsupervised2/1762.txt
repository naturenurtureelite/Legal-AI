Appeals Nos 884 887 of 1962.
268 of 1954 203 of 1955 4 of 1954 and 27 of 1954.
March 12 1964.
The suit out of which appeal No 887 has arisen was filed by the respondent against the State of Rajasthan.
It was also the practice in that State that when permits for export were issued export duties had to be paid in advance though the actual export was made later.
Eventually when the State refused to refund the amount the suit was filed out of which appeal No 887 has arisen in January 1952.
At this time also article 372 of the Constitution continued the existing laws subject to their being altered or repealed by the new State.
This completes the narration of the political changes that took place till the Constitution came into force on January 26 1950.
The High Court permitted the point to be raised as it was a pure question of law.
But this was of course subject to any law made by the new State repealing the old laws and the liabilities arising there under or even otherwise provided the law so made was within the competence of the new State and after the Constitution came into force it did not transgress the constitutional limitations.
