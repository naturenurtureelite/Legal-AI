Appeal No 1671 of 1966.
AV Rangam for the respondents.
425 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Ramaswami J.
The appellant brought the suit in OS No 3 of 1961 in the Court of Subordinate Judge Nagapattinam for setting aside the order dated May 10 1960 of respondent No 1 the Commissioner of Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Madras who had affirmed earlier the order of the second respondent the Deputy Commissioner holding that the trusteeship of the Kumaran Koil in Manjakollai village was not hereditary.
The appellant was elected as a trustee by the Sengunatha Mudaliars of Manjakollai village at a meeting held on June 27 1957.
The definition includes three types of cases 1 succession to the office of trusteeship devolving by hereditary right 2 succession 426 to such office being regulated by usage and 3 succession being specifically provided for by the founder on condition that the scheme of such succession is still in force.
It is not the case of the appellant that the trustees of the temple of the Kumaran Koil are hereditary trustees because their office  devolves by hereditary right or because succession to that office is specifically provided for by the founder.
This is so whether the trustee has a beneficial interest of some sort or not see Ganesh Chunder Dhur vs Lal Behary2 and Bhabatarini vs Ashalata3.
But the election to the office of trustee in the present case is for a fixed period of one year and not for life.
It is therefore difficult to hold that the office of the appellant is hereditary within the meaning of section 69 of the Act.
