Civil Appeal No 213 of 1979 filed by the Bharat Aluminium Company Ltd arises out of Misc.
 Similar provisions were inserted in sections 135 and 136 of the Municipal Corporation Act.
By a letter dated May 21 1977 respondent 1 reduced the demand by Rs 3 lakhs being the amount paid by the Company by way of contribution for the year 1977 under the agreement of 1976.
11 The appellant Company disputed its liability to pay the aforesaid amounts on the grounds principally that no tax was leviable on its property since the Company was owned wholly by the Government of India and that respondent 1 was estopped from levying the property tax by reason of the agreement of 1976.
Section 127A and section 135 which by their own force create and levy the charge of property tax were inserted in the Municipalities Act and the Municipal Corporation Act respectively with effect from April 1 1976 that is subsequent to the insertion of clause d in section 69 of the Act of 1973.

As observed in Nathella Sampathu Chetty there is a distinction between a mere reference to or a citation of one statute in another and an incorporation which in effect means the bodily lifting of the provisions of one enactment and making them part of another so much so that the repeal of the former leaves the latter wholly untouched.
14 Section 69d of the Act of 1973 must accordingly be read to mean that respondent 1 shall have all the powers of taxation which a Municipal Corporation or a Municipal Council has for the time being that is to say at the time when respondent 1 seeks to exercise those powers.
Surely the functions powers and duties of Municipalities do not become an occupied field by reason of the declaration contained in section 2 of the Mines and Minerals Development and Regulation Act 1957.
