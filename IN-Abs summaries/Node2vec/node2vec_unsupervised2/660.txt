Appeal from the judgment and decree dated March 20 1651 of the Mysore High Court in RA No 155 of 1947 48 arising out of the judgment and decree dated December 19 1947 of the Court of SubJudge Mysore in 0.
The couple had three children a son named Narayana lyengar who died on January 14 1944 without any issue and left behind him his widow respondent 1  and the two remaining children of Lakshmamma were daughters Thirumalamma and Yadugiramma.
Both of them are dead.
Respondent 1 s case was that after the death of his father Sadagopalachar her husband Narayana lyengar became the absolute owner of all the properties and so Lakshmamma was not competent in law to make a will in respect of any of them.
Since the main contention raised by the appellant is directed against the finding of the High Court that the will in question is not proved to be the last will and testament of Lakshmamma it would be necessary to refer to the broad features and dispositions of the will and the evidence adduced by the appellant to prove its execution.
Item 3 is bequeathed to respondent 5 and item 4 to respondents 2 3 and 4.
