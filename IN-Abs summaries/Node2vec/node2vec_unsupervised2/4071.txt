For the purpose of holding election to the .
On December 30 1978 the learned Single Judge before whom the case came up for orders directed the issue of notice of the petition and the stay application to the respondents and issued an interim order directing the respondents not to notify the results of the election under Rule 46 of the Rules pending disposal of the petition.
After the respondents filed their counter affidavits the petition was heard and it was dismissed by a Division Bench of the High Court on January 20 1979.
Aggrieved by the order passed by the High Court Ashok Kumar Mishra and Bhagwat Singh Thakur Petitioners No 1 and 5 respectively in the 494 petition before the High Court filed a petition for special leave to appeal to this Court and Purshottam Lal Sharma petitioner No 6 before the High Court filed another petition.
On special leave being granted the above petitions were registered as appeals.
It was also alleged that on October 20 1978 34 persons mentioned in Annexure P 7 approached the Deputy Collector to entertain their claim for inclusion in the electoral roll and he refused to receive their applications.
The claim of petitioner No 5 was rejected as no evidence in support of his claim was produced before the Deputy Collector.
They further pleaded that the authorities would have taken action to correct the error in the notice issued under Rule 41 of the Rules granting 20 days  time to prefer claims and objections if it had been brought to their notice by the petitioners immediately after it was noticed by them.
After November 25 1978 a large number of nominations were received by the Returning officer.
By that time the nominations had all been received.
The writ petition itself was filed on December 28 198 when the poll had to take place on December 31 1978.
It is difficult to place any reliance on the above news item for the purpose of concluding that the Collector Raipur had been informed about the defect in the notice issued under Rule 41 of the Rules by October 21 1978.
No satisfactory reason for the delay was set out in the petition.
