H J Umrigar and B H Dhebar for the respondent.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR J.
The State took an appeal to the High Court and the judgment of acquittal was reversed and of the accused persons the two appellants were convicted and the others were acquitted.
All conciliation proceedings under this sub section shall be deemed to have concluded in the case where no settlement is reached when the report of the Conciliation Officer is received by the appropriate Government.
He is required to bring about settlement between the parties and must begin his investigation without delay and if no settlement is arrived at he is to submit his report to the appropriate Government.
No doubt section 12 contemplates that the report should be made and the proceedings closed within a fortnight and if proceedings are not closed but are carried on as they were in the present case or if the Conciliation Officer does not make his report within 14 days he may be guilty of a breach of duty but in law the proceedings do not automatically come to an end after 14 days but only terminate as provided in section 202b of the Act.
