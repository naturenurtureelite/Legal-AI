In spite of the award and the agreement the appellant paid its employees only As.
The terms in question need not be express and can be implied but they must be terms which arise out of the contract of employment and since an award made by an Industrial Tribunal cannot be said to amount to a contract of employment the wage structure prescribed by the award cannot fall within the definition prescribed by section 2vi.
We are not inclined to hold that even under the unamended definition of wages rates of remuneration prescribed by an award could not be included.
It is now well settled that unlike ordinary civil courts which are bound by the terms of contract between the parties when they deal with disputes arising between them in respect of the said terms Industrial adjudication is not bound to uphold the terms of contract between the employer and the employees.
In our opinion the Bombay view correctly represents the true legal position in the matter.
