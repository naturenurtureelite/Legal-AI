Randhir Singh case was concerned with a driver constable in the Delhi Police Force under the Delhi Administration.
The Court held that the principle of equal pay for equal work has no mechanical application in every case of similar work.
It is therefore not impermissible to provide two different pay scales in the same cadre on the basis of selection based on merit with due regard to experience and seniority.
His case was based on the allegations that he was discharging same duties and performing similar functions as Senior Speech Therapist Senior Physiotherapist Senior Occupa tional Therapist Audiologist and Speech Pathologist.
In the light of the aforesaid principles we may now consider whether the equality claims of the petitioners could be allowed.
From the averments in the pleadings of the parties it will be clear that the Corporation has no regularly employed carpenters.
In the first place even assum ing that the petitioners  jobs are comparable with the counterparts in the government service the petitioners cannot enforce the right to equal pay for equal work.
They cannot claim wages payable to their counterparts in government service.
It requires the consideration of various dimensions of the job.
In the result the petition fails and is dismissed.
