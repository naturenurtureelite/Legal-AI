The sale proceeds not being sufficient to satisfy the assessed tax the Additional Collector on the 7th June 1955 issued a notice under section 13 of the Bombay City Land Revenue Act 1876 requiring the assessee to appear before him in person on the 16th June 1955 and show cause why he the assessee should not be apprehended and confined to civil jail in satisfaction of the said certified demand.
No application was made to the High Court for leave to appeal to this Court from the decision of that High Court but on the 2nd September 1955 the present petition was filed in this Court under article 32 of the Constitution for the relief hereinbefore mentioned.
a Section 462 of the Indian Income tax Act which is impugned before us runs as follows 46.
It is pointed out that the first part of section 462 provides that the Collector on receipt of a certificate from the Income tax Officer shall proceed to recover from the defaulting assessee the amount specified therein as if it were an arrear of land revenue.
All that the sub section directs the Collector to do is to proceed to recover the certified amount as if it were an arrear of land revenue that is to say he is to adopt the procedure prescribed by the appropriate law of his State for the recovery of land revenue and that in thus proceeding he is under the proviso to have all the powers a Civil Court has under the Code.
The argument is that income tax being a subject with respect to which the Union alone may make law and the recovery of it being the Union responsibility the machinery for the recovery of income tax should be framed on a uniform all India basis for to the Union all defaulters who may not pay up the Union demand are similarly situated but the Indian Income tax Act by section 462 authorises the Collectors in different States to adopt machinery which differs from State to State so that defaulters are treated differently in different States.
In such a situation it is a plausible argument to say that all the provisions of all the State laws are mutatis mutandis to be read into section 46 2 and that therefore if there be any vice of discrimination in the State laws that vice cannot but be regarded as having crept into section 462.
This argument appears to us to be well founded.
Each State in its wisdom has devised a machinery which it has considered appropriate and suitable for the recovery of its own public demand.
The grouping of the income tax defaulters into separate categories or classes Statewise is certainly a territorial classification which is based on an intelligible differentia and the subjection for the purposes of the recovery of the certified demand of each of such classes of defaulters to the same coercive process devised by their own State on a consideration of local needs for the recovery of their own public demands cannot be regarded as bereft of a reasonable nexus or correlation between the basis of classification and the object sought to be achieved by the Indian Income tax Act any more than it can be so regarded with respect to the respective State laws.
The first objection formulated by learned counsel for the petitioner must therefore be rejected.
A cursory perusal of the two sections will show at once that the procedure prescribed by section 13 of the Bombay City Land Revenue Act 1876 for the recovery of arrears of land revenue was harsher and more drastic than the procedure laid down in section 157 of the Bombay Land Revenue Code 1879 in that a defaulter residing in the City of Bombay could be kept in detention for a day for every rupee of the arrears which might considerably exceed the maximum period of six months which is the period 904 limited by the Code of Civil Procedure for the detention of a judgment debtor in civil jail.
In the view we have taken it is not necessary to express any opinion whether the discrimination brought about by the two sections was supportable on the ground of a reasonable classification based on territorial considerations so as not to offend the constitutional inhibition.
It is true that the warrant of attachment of the property was issued on the 24th March 1954 but the sale proclamation was issued and the sale was actually held after the date of amendment.
The defaulting assessee might have paid up the dues in which case there would have been no occasion for sale.
In Assam there can be no imprisonment at all.
The periods of detention vary between Bengal UP and the Punjab.
