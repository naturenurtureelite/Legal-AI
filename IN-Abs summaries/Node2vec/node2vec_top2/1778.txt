M C Setalvad and R C Prasad for the appellants.
That in brief is the substance of the argument raised by the appellant.
In this connectionwe may incidentally refer to the decision of this Court in the South Indian Bank Ltd vs A R Chacko1 where it has been observed by this Court that the very purpose for which industrial adjudication has been given the peculiar authority and right of making new contracts between employers and workmen makes it reasonable to think that even though the period of operation of the award and the period for which it remains binding on the parties may elapse in respect of both of which special provisions have been made under sections 23 and 29 respectively the new contract would continue to govern the relations between the parties till it is replaced by another contract.
In our opinion the Bombay view correctly represents the true legal position in the matter.
There would be no order as to costs.
