JD Jain  Mrs Kawaljit Kocher for the Appellant.
Harbans Lal IS Goel  RN Poddar for the Respondent.
He was confirmed in that post in course of time.
On January 21 1974 he was promoted as a Head Clerk on an ad hoc basis.
Section 13 of the Amending Act deleted section 33 of the Act.
A plain consequence of this deletion was that the Panchayat Samitis were divested of their power to make appointments to the Panchayats.
Being aggrieved by his absorption on a lower post he filed a writ petition in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana asking that he should be absorbed as a Head Clerk.
But as a result of the deletion of section 33 of the Act by the Amending Act of 1973 the Panchayat Samiti lost its power to make appointments to the Panchayat.
737 It is urged by Shri Jain who appears on behalf of the appellant that by reason of section 144 of the Amending Act the appellant was entitled to continue in the service of the Panchayat on the same terms and conditions on which he was employed by the Panchayat Samiti until he was absorbed in Government service.
For these reasons the appeal fails and is dismissed.
There will be no order as to costs.
SR Appeal dismissed.
