This Court therefore upheld the constitutional validity of clause fourthly of section 151a clauses fourthly  and fifthly  of section 151b and clause fourthly of section 151c as valid and not infringing Articles 14 or 15 of the Constitution This Court however did not find any justification for the classification contained m section 15 which conferred a right of pre emption on the kinsfolk.
In that case also this Court held that the right of pre emption vested in co shar ers was a reasonable restriction on the right to hold acquire or dispose of property conferred by Article 1911 of the Constitution.
Read in the context it becomes clear that the legislature desired to confer the right of pre emption on specified family members of the vendor or vendors in the first three clauses of section 151b and with a view to covering all the remaining co sharers not specifically mentioned the preceding clauses it used the expression other co sharers  in the fourth clause which was meant to serve as a residuary clause to ensure 127 that no co sharer is left out.
We therefore do not approve the ratio of Jagdish s case and overrule the same.
