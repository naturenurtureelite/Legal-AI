From the Judgment and Order dated 4 4 1973 of the Punjab and Haryana High Court at Chandigarh in RSA No 1482 of 1961.
488 N N Goswamy and Arvind Minocha for the appellant.
Against that decree an appeal was preferred by the appellant to the High Court.
The suit was filed on the basis that the appellant as the lawfully appointed mahant was entitled to manage the properties of the Dera at Landeke that the defendant was unlawfully claiming to be the mahant of the Dera and entitled to manage the properties of the Dera and that the appellant was entitled to be in possession of the properties.
 This rule is based on the principle that trial of a suit cannot be brought to an end merely because the interest of a party in the subject matter of the suit has devolved upon another during the pendency of the suit but that suit may be continued against the person acquiring the interest with the leave of the Court.
He never set up any claim which was adverse to the Dera or its properties.
VPS Appeal allowed.
