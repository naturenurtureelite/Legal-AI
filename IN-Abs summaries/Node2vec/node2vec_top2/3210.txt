Before the High Court the contention of the Federation was that the premises in which the registered office of the Federation is located is not a commercial establishment within the meaning of section 25 of the Act which in consequence had no application.
 352 It was then contended that the activities of the Federation carried on in the premises in question amounted to work in connection with or incidental or ancillary to trade or business in general within the latter part of the definition of commercial establishment.
 It will be seen that while the definition of establishment includes a shop  and commercial establishment the definitions of shop  and commercial establishment  are mutually exclusive.
It came up for consideration before this Court in Management of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry vs Their workman Shri R K Mittal1 After considering its Memorandum of Association Articles of Association and other material which was more or less the same as in the present case it was held by this Court that the activity of this Federation is in the nature of a business or trade.
 Mr Pai further maintains that the ratio in R K Mittal s case supra is not applicable to the instant case because the definition of  industry in section 2j of the is far wider than that of commercial establishment in section 25 of the Act.
It is pointed out that it was wrongly assumed in Mittal s case supra that the Federation was systematically assisting not only its members but also other business men and industrialists even if they were not its members.
These activities were business activities and material services rendered to businessmen traders and industrialists who are members of the constituents of the Federation.
It was condended that the activity of the Association was not a business or trade because by the Memorandum of Associ 1 357 ation all the property and income of the association were applicable solely to the promotion of the above objects and no part thereof could be paid as dividend or otherwise to any member.
