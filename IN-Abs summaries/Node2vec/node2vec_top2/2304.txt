Appeals by special leave from the judgment and order dated  March 6 1967 of the Orissa High Court in OJC Nos.
The High Court overruled the prayer made on behalf of the government to stay the operation of its decision till necessary orders were obtained from this Court.
As mentioned earlier member sales tax tribunal was an ex cadre post.
It is not the case of the parties that he was placed at the disposal of the government for any definite period.
Hence that part of the High Court s order is unassailable.
As seen earlier the cadre of the superior judicial service senior branch consisted of not only the posts of district and sessions judges and addl.
Neither the government nor the High Court could have posted any officer as the Registrar of the High Court as that post can be filled only by 160 the Chief Justice.
1  2  161 namely whether the power to transfer District Judges is included in the control  exercisable by the High Court over District Courts under article 235 or in the power of appointment of persons to be and the posting and promotion of district judges  which is to be exercised by the Governor under article 233 albeit in consultation with the High Court.
 Obviously relying on the observation of this Court that after a judicial officer is posted to the cadre it is for the High Court to effect his transfers the court below has come to the conclusion that as the posts of the law secretary deputy law secretary and superintendent and legal remembrancer are included in the cadre the High Court has the power to fill those posts by transfer of judicial officers.
If only there is mutual understanding and appreciation of the difficulties of the one by the other there will be harmony.
But it was beyond the powers of the High Court to post Shri KB Panda as the law secretary Shri T Misra as superintendent and legal remembrancer and Shri PK Mohanti as the deputy law secretary.
RKPS Appeals allowed in part.
