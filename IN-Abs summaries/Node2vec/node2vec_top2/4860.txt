781 VS Desai Mrs J Wad and Miss Aruna Mathur for the Appellants.
After hearing the learned counsel for the parties we allowed the appeal of Prakash accused 5 and acquitted him and set aside his conviction and the sentence awarded to him.
So far as Vinayak accused 6 is concerned we dismissed his appeal on 1391984 for reason to follow.
Now proceed to record our reasons.
Accused 5 and 6 only have filed Criminal Appeal 288 of 1980 and Criminal Appeal 287 of 1980 respectively against the conviction of accused 5 and the sentence of imprisonment for life awarded by the High Court under section 302 read with section 120B IPC and the confirmation of the conviction and sentence awarded to accused 6 by the trial court under section 302 read with section 34 IPC respectively.
Therefore the High Court did not place any reliance on this circumstance namely recovery of the blood stained shirt article 55 from the house of accused 6.
