Appeals from the judgment and decree dated May 2 1960 of the Rajasthan High Court in Civil Second Appeal Nos.
section K Kapur and B R G K Achar for the appellant in allthe appeals.
R P Modi and R K Garg for the respondents in CA No 8871962.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by WANCHOO J.
These four appeals arise out of four certi ficates granted by the High Court of Rajasthan and raise a common question.
We therefore propose to set out facts in one of the present appeals No 887 as the facts in other appeals are similar except that the commodity involved was different and so was the amount in dispute.
The suit out of which appeal No 887 has arisen was filed by the respondent against the State of Rajasthan.
The respondent was a resident of the former Dholpur State and the dispute which led to the suit related to a time before the merger of former Dholpur State into the Matsya Union.
This permit had been granted on June 28 1947 and remained in force upto December 2 1947.
The respondent however was not able to export the entire quantity of 15000 maunds for which the permit was granted he could only export 4572 maunds and 20 seers of chuni before December 2 1947.
In the meantime rapid constitutional changes took place after August 15 1947.
By May 15 1949 the United State of Rajasthan was formed including the Matsya Union into which the former State of Dholpur had merged on March 17 1948.
The United State of Rajasthan eventually became the Part B State of Rajasthan on January 26 1950 when the Constitution came into force.
The former Dholpur State remained a separate entity till March 17 1948 though it had acceded to the Dominion of India after August 15 1947 with respect to three subjects namely communications defence and external affairs.
