The rules envisaged categorization of personnel manning the service into five different categories viz Categories A  to E .
Under r5 3 the controlling authority had the power to interchange any post included in the junior scale with any post included in the senior scale without altering the authorized strength in each category.
R8 provided for the future maintenance of the Service.
Part A deals with the departmental candidates who were initially appointed in Categories A  and B  of the Service prior to the 1966 Rules.
Part B provides that every departmental candidate who was initially appointed to a category other than Categories A  and B  shall be appointed to the newly formed appropriate Category After selection.
These posts should not be filled by hospital specialists or teaching specialists by promotion in the normal course.
There could be interchange between hospital specialists and Professors in the higher grade subject to the candidates satisfying the prescribed qualifications.
