On June 1 1959 the Bombay Village Panchayat Act 1958 Bombay Act III of 1959 hereinafter referred to as the Act came into effect in Vidharba region and by virtue of this Act the appellant was deemed to be a Panchayat under the Act.
It has been unanimously resolved that by virtue of Grampanchayat Resolution No 2 dated 14 7 61 that octroi duty shall be imposed on the goods coming into its local limits the committee accepts the same.
The matter of levying octroi duty shall be undertaken in accordance with the Panchayat Act and its rules.
This matter may be taken into hand very urgently.
On February 25 1963 resolution No3 was passed.
This levy should come into fo rce from 1 4 1963 and its final publication be done on 1 3 1963 as per rules and by public notice and by announcement by beat of drums through loudspeakers On March 17 1963 resolution No 3 was passed fixing octroi limits and number of octroi nakas and their places.
On March 18 1963 the Panchayat wrote to the Collector Nagpur seeking his approval to the octroi limits number of octroi nakas and their places.
It appears that the Panchayat started collecting octroi from April 1 1963.
The Panchayat Samiti however rejected the appeal by its resolution dated September 4 1963.
Section 1241 empowers Panchayats to levy all or any of the taxes and fees mentioned therein and reads as follows 1241.
The tax or fee shall accordingly be levied from.
Fixing of octroi limits and nakas.
A Panchayat shall with the approval of the Collector or of any officer authorised by the Collector not below the rank of Mamlatdar Tehsildar Naib Tehsildar or Mahalkari fix octroi limits and the number and location of octroi Nakas within 219 the limits of its jurisdiction.
It seems to us that the octroi duty has been levied in accordance with law.
Accordingly.
