They were in the pay scale of Rs 160 320 as against the pay scale of Rs 120 300 to Section Officers.
The report did not accept the claim of Bench Secretaries for giving them pay scale equal to Section Officers or Private Secretaries.
the pay scale recommended by the Pay Rationalisation Committee the nature of duties and responsibilities and the fact that every Hon ble Judge will have one Private Secretary in the scale of Rs500 1000 we feel that the Bench Secretaries cannot be given the same scale of pay which is being given to Superintendents or the Section Officers.
They have to prepare lengthy original notes in complicated matters.
 The Anomalies Committee also thus rejected the claim of Bench Secretaries for placing them at par with Section Officers.
For appointment on these posts a limited competitive examination is held from amongst Upper Division Assistants PG NO 296 Lower Division Assistants with ten years of service preferably Law Graduates.
