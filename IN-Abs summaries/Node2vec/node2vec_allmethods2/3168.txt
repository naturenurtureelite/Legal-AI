The Judgment of the Court was delivered by ALAGIRISWAMI J.
It arises out of a complaint filed against the 1st respondent company and its directors for failure to Me with the Registrar of Companies on or before 30 10 1967 the balance sheet and profit and loss account of the company as required under section 2201 of the  which is punishable under sub section 3 of that section.
view that a person charged with an offence cannot rely on his default as an answer to the charge and so if he was responsible for not calling the general meeting he cannot be heard to say in defence to the charges brought against him that because the general meeting had not been called the balance sheet and profit and loss account could not be laid before it.
In that case the directors of a company were prosecuted under sections 325 and 1333 of the Companies Act 1913 for breaches of sections 32 and 131 of that Act for having knowingly and wilfully authorized the failure to file the summary of share capital for the year 1953 and being knowingly and wilfully parties to the failure to lay before the company in general meeting the balance sheet and profit and loss account as at March 31 1953.
