Ltd section K Gambhir for the applicant intervener State of MP.
Petition No 555 of 1977 filed by it in the High Court of Madhya Pradesh under Article 226 of the Constitution.
Chapter VIII of the Act consisting of sections 64 to 71 is entitled Special Areas.
Section 64 empowers the State Government to declare any area as a special area by issuing a notification.
The Chairman and the members of the Development Authority are appointed by the Government.
Section 68 which prescribes the functions of the Development Authority lays down by clauses v and vi that the Development Authority shall make provision for the municipal services and municipal management of the Special Area.
Since there was no Municipal Corporation or Municipal Council in the Korba Special Area prior to the constitution of the Development Authority the Government was required under sub clause b above to direct whether the Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act 1956 or the Madhya Pradesh Municipalities Act 1961 shall apply to the Korba Special Area for the purposes of clauses v and vi of section 68 and clauses c and d of section 69.
The corresponding provision in the Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act 1956 is section 132 1a.
In 1964 the Madhya Pradesh State Legislature had enacted the Madhya Pradesh Nagariya Sthawar Sampatti Kar Adhiniyam which was made applicable to the whole State including the urban areas.
To compensate the municipal councils and the municipal corporations for the loss arising from the abolition of the octroi tax the Government decided to confer powers on these bodies for levying property tax.
For conferring powers to levy property tax Ordinance No 4 of 1976 was promulgated.
Both of these Ordinances were published in the Madhya Pradesh Gazette dated April 30 1976 from which date they came into force.
Ordinance No 4 of 1976 inserted certain provisions in the Municipalities Act and the Municipal Corporation Act.
By section 12 of that Act the provisions inserted in the Municipalities Act and the Municipal Corporation Act with which we are concerned were deemed to have come into force with effect from April 1 1976.
While the Company was pursuing that matter with the State Government contending that it was not liable to pay the entry tax by reason of the aforesaid agreement on January 4 1977 respondent 1 made a further demand of Rs 3 lakhs on the Company for contribution for the year 1977.
By a notice issued under section 65 of the Act of 1973 on February 211977 and by another notice issued under section 1643 of the Madhya Pradesh Municipalities Act 1961 on April 15 1977 the Chief Executive Officer of respondent 1 called upon the Company to pay a sum of Rs 1322160 by way of property tax for the year 1976 77.
On July 16 1977 the Company was called upon to pay a further sum of Rs 136567350 as property tax for the year 1977 78.
Having failed to persuade respondent 1 to accept its point of view the Company filed o Writ Petition in the Madhya Pradesh High Court asking that the demands be quashed.
Civil Appeal No 213 of 1979 by special leave is directed against the dismissal of the Writ Petition.
That Company has been called upon by respondent 1 to pay property tax for the years 1976 77 and 1977 78 in the sum of Rs 371461 for each year.
The Writ Petitions 61 and 62 of 1978 filed by it were dismissed by the High Court following the judgment delivered in the Writ Petition filed by the Bharat Aluminium Company Ltd Civil Misc.
