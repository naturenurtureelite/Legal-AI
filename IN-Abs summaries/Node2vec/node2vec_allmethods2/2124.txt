il Appeal Nos 931 and 1149 of 1965.
N C Chatterjee Janaradan Sharma K B Rohtagi and section Balakrishnan for the appellant in CA No 931 of 1965 and the respondent in C A No 1149 of 1965.
These appeals arise out of an election to a seat in the West Bengal Legislative Assembly from the Khargram Murshidabad constitutency reserved for members of the Scheduled Castes.
The contestants at this election were Abhoy Pada Saha and Sudhir Kumar Mondal.
The objection was rejected by the Returning Officer.
Sudhir then filed a petition challenging the validity of Abhoy Pada s election on various grounds.
At the hearing of the petition by the Election Tribunal however he challenged the election only on the ground that Abhoy Pada was a member of the Saha caste and not a member of a Scheduled Caste.
The Election Tribunal rejected this contention and dismissed the petition.
Appeal No 931 of 1965 is by Abhoy Pada.
article 332 of the Constitution provides that seats shall be reserved for the Scheduled Castes in the Legislative Assembly of every State.
The question is whether the appellant was a member of the Scheduled Caste specified in this item.
Nobody disputes that.
the other must be a caste.
