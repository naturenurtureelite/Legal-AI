Appeal No 251 of 1963.
Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated March 20 1957 of the Patna High Court in Civil Revision No 40 of 1956.
M C Setalvad and R C Prasad for the appellants.
The respondent did not appear.
This question has to be answered in the light of the definition prescribed by section 2vi before it was amended in 1958.
This agreement was subsequently published in the Bihar Gazette as a part of the award.
 10  per day and that led to the present claim made by the respondents under section 15 of the Act.
It urged that section 15 of the Act was inapplicable because the rates of wages fixed by the award did not fall within the definition of wages prescribed by section 2vi and it also argue that the claim of the respondents was barred by limitation.
The High Court has affirmed the finding of the authority and held that section 15 was applicable to the case because the wages prescribed by the award did amount to wages as defined by section 2vi of the Act.
Section 2vi as it stood at the relevant time provides inter alia that wages means all remuneration capable of being expressed in terms of money which would if the terms of the contract of employment express or implied were fulfilled be payable.
That in brief is the substance of the argument raised by the appellant.
