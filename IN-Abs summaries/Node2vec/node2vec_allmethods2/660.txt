section Suit No 44 of 1946 47.
November 13.
One Annaji lyengar who died in July 1903 left behind him his adopted son the appellant and two daughters Gundamma alias Ranganayakamma who is still alive and Lakshmamma alias Achamma who is alleged to have executed the will in suit and died thereafter on September 26 1945 at Mandya.
Respondents 2 to 4 are the sons of the appellant.
Jaya was married to Kalbagal Junior.
The claim made by the appellant under the will is resisted by respondent 1.
The appellant alleged that Sadagopalachar was a man of very moderate means and had given up his petty job in the registration department in order to manage the properties received by him and his wife from Annaji lyengar.
Respondent 1 did not admit that the properties subsequently purchased by Sadagopalachar including items 3 to 5 were purchased with any monies bequeathed to him and his wife by Annaji lyengar according to her Sadagopalachar had made these purchases with his own funds.
The purchases made by Narayana Iyengar were held to have been made out of the income of the properties of his father and of his mother.
The High Court held that the appellant had not established that when Lakshmamma was 432 alleged to have executed the will she was in a sound and disposing state of mind or that it was her will in the sense that it represented her intentions.
