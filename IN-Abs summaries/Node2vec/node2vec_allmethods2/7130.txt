Taneja for the Respondents.
The plaintiffs case in the plaint was that he was the lessee in respect of seven lots on an annual rent of Rs 3600 payable in advance in three instalments that he had paid the rent upto the end of December 1967 and the first installment of 1968 but the owner defendant No 2 in collusion with defendant No 1 executed a deed of lease in favour of the latter effective from January 1 1968 on the strength whereof defendant No 1 claimed to have assumed possession of the property sometime in the second week of June 1968 without his tenancy having been lawfully terminated.
The defendants therefore contended that the suit was not maintainable and deserved to be dismissed.
The Trial Court upheld the plaintiffs contention that the property was demised to him and he was the lawful tenant thereof till his possession came to be disturbed sometime in June 1968.
The First Appellate Court concurred with the findings recorded by the Trial Court and dismissed the appeal on March 25 1986.
On these findings the High Court allowed the appeals and 1021 reversed the decree of the Trial Court with no order as to costs.
It is against this order of the High Court that the present appeal by special leave is preferred.
It is not the finding of the High Court that in the previous suit the question regarding the tenancy of the plaintiff was determined against the plaintiff.
It was for this technical reason that the suit was dismissed.
The High Court has concluded against the plaintiff on this point in paragraph 31 which reads as under Thus it is compelling to acknowledge that the subject matter of the second suit was directly and substantially in issue in the previous suit between the same parties.
Now in the fact situation of the present case as we have pointed out earlier the first suit was for an injunction and not for possession of the demised property.
Section 18 lays down the procedure for taking possession.
