VAISH ENGINEER IN CHIEF To Shri AL Ahuja Assistant Engineer Civil Under Suspension A1185 Lajpat Nagar New Delhi 110024.
 It is clear from it that the petitioner attained the age of 50 years on 1021972 and therefore on the date of the order he had completed the age of 54 years.
As already indicated above he had crossed the age of 50 years but had not attained the age of 55 years by the date of the impugned order.
Support is claimed from the observations in the Tahilia ni s case supra.
The sole question that fell therein for decision before this Court was whether a Government servant officiating in Class I or Class II service or post could be retired compulsorily by exercising the power under Rule 56ji after he has attained the age of 50 years.
The two Judge Bench which decided the case held  An officiating hand has no right to the post and is perhaps a fleeting.
bird who may have to go back to the substantive post from which he has been promoted on an officiating basis what is more to the point a person who has been appointed de novo may begin his service on an officiating basis or on a tempo rary basis and it is obvious that he has no right to the post and cannot be strictly said to be in that service or post as a member of that service.
In short an officiating Govern ment servant does not really belong to Class I or Class II service until he acquires a right thereon.
1976 and 292.
