minal Appeals Nos.
91 to 93 of 1954.

N C Chakravarty for the appellants.
In Criminal Appeals Nos 92 and 93 of 1954.
P A Mehta and P G Gokhale for the respondent.
December 3.
Each was convicted and each was 1085 sentenced to death under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code.
The appeals and the confirmation proceedings in the High Court were heard by M section Ali Khan and V R Deshpande JJ.
They differed.
The latter favoured an acquittal in all five cases.
It seems that the opinion of the third Judge was accepted as the decision of the Court and so the sentences suggested by him were maintained as well as the convictions.
All five convicts then applied to the High Court for leave to appeal.
The petition was heard by Ali Khan and Reddy JJ.
Leave to appeal was refused.
Pandurang Tukia and Bhilia who were sentenced to death applied here for special leave to appeal.
Their petition was granted.
The prosecution case is this.
Rasika Bai started to pick chillies in the field while Ramehander went to another field Vaniya che seth which is about a furlong away.
We gather that this field is near a river called 1086 Papana.
Anyway Rasika Bai heard shouts from that direction so she ran to the river bank with Subhana and they both say that they saw all five accused attacking Ramchander with axes and sticks.
Rasika Bai shouted out to the assailants not to beat Ramchander but they threatened her and then ran away.
There are four eye witnesses and the main question we have to consider is whether they can be believed.
Ordinarily we would not have enquired into questions of fact but as three persons have been sentenced to death on the opinion of the third Judge despite the opinion of one that the death sentence should not be imposed and of the other that the appellants are not guilty and so should be acquitted we have deemed it advisable to examine the evidence.
Two of the eye witnesses were considered unreliable by Reddy J in the High Court so we will omit them from consideration and concentrate on the other two Rasika Bai PW1 and Subhana PW7.
In the circumstances we think Mahadappa told the truth.
