On April 9 1959 the Central Government directed removal from service of Capt section K Rao under r 14 of the Army Rules 1954.
The facts leading to his removal are as follows  Rao was a commissioned officer in the Indian Army and was attached to the Army Ordnance Corps Training Centre Secundrabad.
It was alleged that on April 4 1958 he committed acts of gross misconduct.
The Chief of the Army Staff after going through the proceedings of the Court of Inquiry considered that the conduct of Capt.
As he was of opinion that trial of the officer by a General Court Martial was inexpedient he ordered administrative action to be taken under r 14 of the Army Rules 1954.
By memorandum dated September 4 1958 Rao was called upon to submit his explanation by way of defence regarding the allegations against him.
The Central Government found it to be unsatisfactory and on April 9 1959 an order was passed removing the respondent from service.
Rao thereupon filed a petition under article 226 of the Constitution for quashing the order of removal from service on the 449 ground inter alia that r 14 of the Army Rules 1954 was ultra vires the  and that the action taken thereunder was without any authority.
According to him he did not assist Kumari Prakash to go away from her parents  house.

450 Before removal he must under the rule be asked to submit his explanation and defence.
Sub section 1 of section 191 gives power to the Central Government to make rules for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of the Act.
 section 19 Subject to the provisions of this Act and the rules and regulations made thereunder the Central Government may dismiss or remove from the service any person subject to this Act.
 Offenses under the have been dealt with in sections 34 to 70 in Ch.

Section 191 2 a specifically gives.
Rule 14 is such a rule  it is therefore not ultra vires.
But the power under section 19 is an independent power.
Although section 19 uses the words subject to the provisions of this Act it speaks of removal of a person from the service.
