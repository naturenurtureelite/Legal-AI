Civil Appeal No 159 of 1974.
The trial court decreed the suit.
The High Court referred the question to the trial Court for enquiry and decision.
The High Court found no substance in the plea that the appellant had no knowledge about the date of the death of Som Dass and held that the appeal had abated and that there was no ground for setting aside the abatement.
 489 We do not think that the view of the High Court was correct.
The suit was filed on the basis that the appellant as the lawfully appointed mahant was entitled to manage the properties of the Dera at Landeke that the defendant was unlawfully claiming to be the mahant of the Dera and entitled to manage the properties of the Dera and that the appellant was entitled to be in possession of the properties.
Order 22 rule 10 is not confined to devolution of interest of a party by death it also applies if the head of the mutt or manager of the temple resigns his office or is removed from office.
We see no force in this argument.
Som Dass contended that he was lawfully appointed as mahant of the Dera.
