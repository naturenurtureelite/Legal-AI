The brief facts of the case are as under.
The appellant Sunderamoorthy was an Accountant cum Headclerk in the Tamil Nadu Forest Training School at Vaigai Dam.
He took charge of the office on 6101975 and had been residing in a house opposite the training school.
This was on the basis of a complaint made by the appellant that the food served in the canteen was substand ard.
The appellant had taken food in the canteen for two days and being dissatisfied discontinued the practice before the notice was issued.
On 21101975 the appellant is stated to have pressed the demand to PW 1.
The appellant produced the currency notes.
PW 3 the Principal produced the concerned file relating to show cause notice from the house of the appellant on the same day.
Finally the appellant was chargesheeted.
The Trial Court accepted the prosecution evidence rejected the plea of the appellant and recorded the conviction.
It was also urged that the appellant being new in the office could exert little influence on the Principal and the whole story is therefore improbable.
Of course it is open to that person to show that though that money was not due to him as legal remuneration it was legally due to him in some other manner or that he had received it under a transaction or an arrangement which was lawful.
The burden resting on the accused person in such a case would not be as light as it is where a presumption is raised under section 114 of Evidence Act and cannot be held to be discharged merely by reason of the fact that the explanation offered by the accused is reasonable and probable.
The words unless the contrary is proved  which occur in this provision make it clear that the presumption has to be rebutted by proof  and not by a bare explanation which is merely plausible.
