It arises out of a complaint filed against the 1st respondent company and its directors for failure to Me with the Registrar of Companies on or before 30 10 1967 the balance sheet and profit and loss account of the company as required under section 2201 of the  which is punishable under sub section 3 of that section.
The Full Bench speaking through Jaganmohan Reddy CJ as our learned brother then was held that if no balance sheet is laid before a general body there can be no question of that balance sheet not being adopted nor of complying with the requirements of section 220 and though wilful omission to call a general body meeting and to lay the balance sheet and profit and loss account before it may expose the person responsible to punishment under other provisions of the Act it certainly does not make him liable under the provisions of section 1344 of the Companies Act 1913 or section 220 of the .
As we have noticed this Court was not dealing there with the provisions of section 134 of 1913 Act which corresponds to section 220 of the 1956 Act.
It is clear therefore that on principle and authority it should be held that no offence was committed by the directors in this case under section 134.
