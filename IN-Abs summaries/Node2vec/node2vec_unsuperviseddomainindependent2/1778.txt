M C Setalvad and R C Prasad for the appellants.
This question has to be answered in the light of the definition prescribed by section 2vi before it was amended in 1958.
This agreement was subsequently published in the Bihar Gazette as a part of the award.
 10  per day and that led to the present claim made by the respondents under section 15 of the Act.
421 The authority has found that section 2vi includes wages prescribed by the Industrial Tribunal and so it has rejected the appellants  contention that the applications made by the respondents were incompetent under section 15 of the Act.
The High Court has affirmed the finding of the authority and held that section 15 was applicable to the case because the wages prescribed by the award did amount to wages as defined by section 2vi of the Act.
Mr Setalvad for the appellant contends that before it is held that the wages prescribed by the award fall under section 2vi it must be shown that they constitute part of the terms of the contract of employment either express or implied.
That in brief is the substance of the argument raised by the appellant.
