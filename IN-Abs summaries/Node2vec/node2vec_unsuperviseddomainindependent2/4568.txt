R3 provided for the constitution of the Central Health Service.
Part B provides that every departmental candidate who was initially appointed to a category other than Categories A  and B  shall be appointed to the newly formed appropriate Category After selection.
We notice that at present out of 27 clinical specialities only a few have posts in Supertime Grade II.
As the statutory rules do not provide that the teaching experience gained in an ex officio capacity shall not count towards the requisite teaching experience the teaching experience gained by the appellant while holding the post of Radiologist cum Associate Professor of Radiology ex officio in the Irwin Hospital cannot be ignored in determining his eligibility for appointment as Professor or Radiology in Maulana Azad Medical College.
Qualifications relaxable at Commission s discretion in the case of candidates otherwise well qualified.
It is declared that the appellant had acquired the requisite teaching experience as envisaged by r 8 2A and paragraph 3 of Annexure I to the Second Schedule of the Central Health Service Rules 1963 as amended by the Central Health Service Amendment Rules 1966 and was therefore eligible to be considered for appointment to the post of Associate Professor of Radiotherapy in Maulana Azad Medical College which had fallen vacant in 1973.
