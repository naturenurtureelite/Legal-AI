But this question was not answered by the High Court which confined itself to answering the first question which was common to both the appeals.
The Appellate Tribunal also did not accept the submissions of the assessee and upheld the order of assessment.
Indian Act.
In order to determine the true meaning of the words of the proviso it is necessary and convenient to refer to the scheme of the Indian Act which is admitted by the parties to be same as that of the Travancore Act.
In 1939 the idea of total world income  was introduced and the definition of total income  was modified by the Indian Income tax Amendment Act VII of 1939 which also made consequential changes in other sections of the Indian Act.
Section 3 provided for the charge of income tax in respect of the total income of the previous year.
In the Indian Act they were set out in section 6 as follows section 6  Save as otherwise provided by this Act the following heads of income profits and gains shall be chargeable to income tax in the manner hereinafter appearing namely iv Profits and gains of business profession or vocation.
In 1941 during the war an exemption was given for the purpose of taxability to any income profits or gains which accrued or arose within what was then called Indian States but which were not received or brought into British India.
This section was introduced in 1922 before which under the Indian Act of 1918 a loss under one head of income could not be set off against income under another head the taxability of income arising from each head being separate.
Thus the mere use of the words loss of profits or gains to be set off against profits and gains would not be sufficient to restrict the scope of the proviso to the profits and losses arising under the head business in the two territories i e British India and the Indian States.
In our view the question referred to the High Court which is common to the two appeals was rightly answered in favour of the assessee.
Appeals dismissed.
