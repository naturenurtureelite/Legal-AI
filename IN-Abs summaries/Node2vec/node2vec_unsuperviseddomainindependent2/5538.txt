The main question involved in this appeal is whether the appellant was a licensee or a tenant and also incidentally the question whether the Court of Small Causes Bombay had jurisdiction to deal with the eviction petition in this case.
The agreement is described as an agreement of leave and licence  entered into between the respondent on the one hand and the appellant on the other wherein the respondent had been described as the licensor and the appellant had been described as the licensee  and the recitals therein recite that the licensor was seized and possessed of and was otherwise well entitled as the monthly tenant of the workshop premises situated at 231 Ripon Road Cooperative Building Bombay being the premises in dispute and whereas the licensee had approached the licensor to allow him to occupy and use the said premises for the purpose of carrying out his business of workshop for a period of five years and whereas the licensor had agreed to allow the licensee to use the premises under the said leave and licence of the licensor for a period of five years from 1st of September 1965 till 31st of August 1970 that agreement was being executed.
The period of leave and licence was to commence from 1st of September 1965 to 31st of August 1970 and it was further submitted that the licensee and the licensor shall not terminate the said agreement earlier save and except on the ground of breach of any of the terms and conditions written therein.
The licensor was entitled to terminate the agreement earlier notwithstanding the fact that the period of the agreement might not have expired.
The agreement recited that the licensee shall not allow any other person to use and occupy the said premises and shall not do any unlawful or illegal business therein.
It is well to refer to section 41 of the said Act which is in Chapter VII and deals with summons against person occupying property without leave and provides that when any person has had possession of any immovable property situate within the local limits of the Small Cause Court s jurisdiction and of which the annual value at rack rent did not exceed two 1062 thousand rupees as the tenant or by permission of another person or of some person through whom such other person claims and such tenancy or permission has been determined or withdrawn then a suit can be filed by a summons against the occupant calling upon him to show cause therein.
The contention of the respondent that he was a tenant was negatived by the Small Cause Court Bombay.
In any event this is a possible view that could be taken.
NPV Appeal dismissed.
