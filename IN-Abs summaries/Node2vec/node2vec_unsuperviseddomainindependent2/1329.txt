The Sales Tax Officer rejected this claim for exemption and assessed them to sales tax on a taxable turnover including these sales.
The notice of demand for the total sales tax and the purchase tax assessed was served on the sellers on September 30 1956.
The learned Judge who heard the petition rejected the sellers  contention that the goods remained their property till these crossed the customs frontier and therefore held that the sellers were not entitled to the benefit of article 2861b of the Constitution.
Against this decision the sellers appealed.
Though the learned Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the Sales Tax Officer tried to convince us that these were not really FOB contract sales it appears that the averment in Paras.
In Civil Appeal No 46 of 1959 the appellants  contention is that on a correct interpretation of the provisions of section 10b of the Bombay Sales Tax Act no purchase tax was leviable from them.
b of section 8 has been furnished in respect of such goods and the purchasing dealer does not show to the satisfaction of the Collector that the goods have been despatched by him or by a person to whom he has sold the goods to an address outside the State of Bombay within a period of six months from the date of purchase by the dealer furnishing such certificate .
Mr Sanyal contended that the certificate 933 has to declare only an intention and that if ultimately the actual despatch is made by some person who is not a registered dealer it cannot strictly be said that the declaration has not been carried out.
