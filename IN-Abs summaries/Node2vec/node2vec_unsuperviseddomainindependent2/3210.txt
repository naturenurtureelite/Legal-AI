The facts bearing on this question may now be stated Respondent 1 hereinafter referred to as the Federation is a Company registered under section 26 of the Indian Companies Act 1913.
This contention did not find favour with the Chief Inspector who in consequence made a complaint under the Act for prosecution of the Secretary of the Federation Respondent 2 herein under the appropriate penal provisions of the Act in the Court of the Magistrate.
From the side of the present appellant at first a half hearted attempt was made to show that the Federation is carrying on a profession as it is tendering advice to all businessmen and traders.
This contention was also rejected with the observation that since the earlier part of the definition refers to some particular business or trade carried on in a premises the words any work in connection with or incidental or necessary thereto obviously refer to such particular business or trade and not to trade or business in general .
They read Commercial establishment means any premises wherein any trade business or profession or any work in connection with or incidental or ancillary thereto is carried on and includes a society registered under the  and charitable or other trust whether registered or not which carries on any business trade or profession or work in connection with or incidental or ancillary thereto  journalistic and printing establishments quarries and mines not governed by the  educational or other Institutions run for private gain and premises in which business of banking insurance stocks and shares brokerage or produce exchange is carried on but does not include a shop or a factory registered under the  or theaters cinemas restaurants eating houses residential hotels clubs or other places of public amusement or entertainment.
Mr Pai learned Counsel for the Federation has firstly raised a preliminary objection that before the High Court at no stage it was urged on behalf of the Appellants that the activity of the Federation carried on in the premises was a business or trade.
These activities were business activities and material services rendered to businessmen traders and industrialists who are members of the constituents of the Federation.
