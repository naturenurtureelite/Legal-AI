N Criminal Appeal Nos.
After hearing the learned counsel for the parties we allowed the appeal of Prakash accused 5 and acquitted him and set aside his conviction and the sentence awarded to him.
Now proceed to record our reasons.
The last charge No 4 framed against accused 1 6 and 7 was under section 302 read with section 34 IPC on the allegation that in pursuance of the conspiracy and in furtherance of their common intention they committed the murder of Malan on or about 111976.
The accused pleaded not guilty to the charges framed against them.
We were therefore not called upon to consider any such question.
