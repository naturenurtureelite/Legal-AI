Kapil Sibbal and D Probir Mitra for respondents.
The appellant brought the suit on the allegation that there was one Shiromani Nirankari Dera at Patiala that this institution had two branches one at Landeke in Moga Tehsil and the other at Nanga Kheri in the erstwhile Patiala State and that he as mahant in charge of the Shiromani Dera at Patiala had the right to manage the properties attached to the Dera at Landeke.
Som Dass the defendant contended that the Dera at Landeke was an independent Dera and that he was in possession of the properties of the Dera as its lawfully appointed mahant.
The trial Court after taking evidence found that Som Dass died on 13 10 1970.
We see no force in this argument.
We are of the view that devolution of the interest in the subject matter of the suit took place when Shiam Dass was elected as mahant of the Dera after the death of Som Dass.
Som Dass contended that he was lawfully appointed as mahant of the Dera.
We allow the appeal but in the circumstances make no order as to costs.
VPS Appeal allowed.
