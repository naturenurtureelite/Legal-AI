RK Jain RPSingh and YDChandrachud for the Appellant.
US Prasad for the Respondents.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SABYASACHI MUKHARJI J.
Special leave granted.
The order dated 25th March 1988 of the Collector is under challenge in this appeal.
Samastipur is therefore placed in the black list for future under the orders passed by the Collector Samastipur.
 This order was passed pursuant to the order of the Collector.
The letter dated 25th March 1988 states as follows The Collector of the district after perusal of the said office note passed order on 25388 which is produced in verbatim below Ist bidder chunki defaulter hai atah security prapt kar len tatha bhavishya ke liae Black list karen.
 Indisputably no notice had been given to the appellant of the proposal of black listing the appellant.
It was contended on behalf of the State Government that there was no requirement in the rule of giving any prior notice before black listing any person.
In so far as the contention that there is no requirement specifically of giving any notice is concerned the respondent is right.
But it is an implied principle of the rule of law that any order having civil consequence should be passed only after following the PG NO 869 principles of natural justice.
It has to be realised that black listing any person in respect of business ventures has civil consequence for the future business of the person concerned in any event.
In the premises that portion of the order directing that the appellant be placed in the black list in respect of future contracts under the Collector is set aside.
This order will however not prevent the State Government or the appropriate authorities from taking any future steps for blacklisting the appellant if the Government is so entitled to do so in accordance with law ie giving the appellant due notice and an opportunity of making representation.
The appeal is thus disposed of.
