He therefore sought possession of the property in respect of which he claimed to be a lessee.
2788 and 3188 which came to be allowed on April 5 1991.
It is not the finding of the High Court that in the previous suit the question regarding the tenancy of the plaintiff was determined against the plaintiff.
The High Court is therefore clearly wrong in its view that the relief claimed is neither relevant nor material.
The first suit was dismissed on the technical ground that since the plaintiff was not in de facto possession no injunction could be granted and a suit for a mere declaration of status without seeking the consequential relief for possession could not lie.
Therefore the cause of action for the former suit was based on an apprehension that the defendants were likely to forcibly dispossess the plaintiff.
It may be that the subject matter of the suit was the very same property but the cause of action was distinct and so also the relief claimed in the subsequent.
Ever where a tenant apprehends that his possession is likely to be interfered with contrary to the provisions of the Act he can make an application in the prescribed manner to the Mamlatdar for safeguarding the same.
So also where a tenant is evicted illegally section 82 permits him to approach the Mamlatdar for recovery of possession.
Since section 12 of the Rent Act was held to be prospective the question which arose for consideration was whether its protection could be extended to tenants in pending litigation.
We would like to make it clear that the hypothetical situations may or may not apply to the fact situation that may emanate of the pleadings in this case and it would be for the Trial Court to determine the course of action to be adopted in the light of the guidelines indicated hereinabove.
