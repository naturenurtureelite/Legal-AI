K Ram Kumar SA Ahmed Tanweer Abdul and Mohan Pandey for the Respondents.
In view of the fact that a petition of compromise in respect of the entire subject matter of litigation has been filed in this Court it is unnecessary to refer to the facts leading to the litigation.
We shall therefore confine the discussion to matters pertinent to the compromise.
Subbamma adopted one KV Seshiah.
Seshiah married two wives.
In February 1985 during the pendency of the special leave petition the adoptive mother died.
While each of the parties had taken such stand in the litigation a compromise was brought about on 2181987 between the father and his two sons and the same was filed in this Court.
When the matter was listed before the Court for recording of the compromise Sudarshan Gupta second respondent herein maintained that he had not been paid Rs1 lakh as stipulated and he had no intention to accept the compromise.
The alienations are for about a purported consideration of Rs 4 lakhs.
The alienees have admittedly been in possession of the property from the date of the sales which is more than three years  old by now.
Admittedly the transfers are pendente lite.
The alienees have made an attempt to hold out that there were agreements for sale prior to the compromise for which there is no acceptable evidence.
The factum of compromise is not in dispute.
He sought to rely on certain decisions which on being referred to were found to be totally inapplicable to the facts of the case.
The alienees have no right created under the alleged sale deeds.
