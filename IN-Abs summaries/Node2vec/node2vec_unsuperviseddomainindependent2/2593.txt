The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Sikri J.
The plaintiff appealed to the High Court claiming arrears of salary and the State of Bombay filed cross objections praying that the suit be dismissed.
The appeal is now before us.
Before we deal with the above points we may give a few facts.
The plaintiff entered service in the Gondal State in 1927 as a jailor.
In substance the charges were that while he was serving at Surendranagar he had committed certain acts of mis appropriation of food stuffs meant for prisoners maltreatment of prisoners and acceptance of illegal gratification from them.
The plaintiff appeared before that officer and cross examined witnesses.
Sd M J BHATT Inspector General of Prisons Government of Saurashtra.
He was dismissed by the Inspector General of Prisons by his order dated February 24 1955.
The State of Bombay admitted that the plaintiff was not supplied with a copy of the report of the Enquiry Officer but pleaded that the plaintiff had not asked for copy of the report and had not been prejudiced by the non supply of the copy of the report.
Moreover as pointed out by the High Court the Inspector General of Prisons had the report before him and the tentative conclusions arrived at by the Enquiry Officer were bound to influence him and in depriving the plaintiff of a copy of the report he was handicapped is not knowing what material was influencing the Inspector General of Prisons.
It seems to us however that some elements of relationship between a public servant and Government are based on contract within the meaning of section 60 of the Bombay Reorganisation Act 1960.
