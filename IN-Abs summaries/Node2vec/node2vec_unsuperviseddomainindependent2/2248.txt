The appellant had in this petition prayed for the issue of a writ quashing the resolution dated April 6 1964 passed by the Standing Committee Zila Parishad Nagpur and for a writ of mandamus directing the Standing Committee not to interfere with the right of the appellant to impose and collect the octroi duty pursuant to its resolution dated February 25 1963.
On March 18 1963 the Panchayat wrote to the Collector Nagpur seeking his approval to the octroi limits number of octroi nakas and their places.
The Panchayat Samiti however rejected the appeal by its resolution dated September 4 1963.
On April 6 1964 the Standing Committee allowed the appeal of the Company on two grounds first that it was necessary for the Panchayat to have the octroi limits fixed with the approval of the Collector before levying octroi under r 21 and secondly that the Company was not importing tea within the limits of the Panchayat for consumption use or sale.
The High Court held that the Panchayat Samiti could not dismiss the appeal of the Company as being barred by limitation because r 5 of the Fees Rules was ultra vires the powers of the rule making authority.
The High Court further held that the octroi duty was not validly levied by the Panchayat as it had failed to fix the octroi limits in accordance with law.
It only deals with two items 1 selection of the tax and the rate at which it is to be levied.
