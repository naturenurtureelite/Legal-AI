The question to be ultimately decided falls within a very narrow compass but it is neces sary to set out the facts leading to the present appeal at some length.
The second lease deed Ext.
The order of the Rent Controller was dated 93.
Further interest at the rate of 12 thereon from date of plaint to the date of decree and at 6 thereafter till the date of realisation was also claimed.
So far as the first question is concerned we have no doubt that the Division Bench of the High Court has come to the correct conclusion.

They clearly make out that the superstruc tures put up by the lessee under exhibit P 1 were not included in the property conveyed under the terms of exhibit P 3 and that whatever may be the rights of the LIC to evict the tenant with liberty to demolish the superstructure on the termination of the lease it had no property in the super structure so long as the lease subsisted.

An appeal by the tenant also failed but here again the above point was not taken.
