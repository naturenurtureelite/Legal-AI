On the 12th April 1954 the present petition under article 32 of the Constitution was filed for the issue of appropriate writs restraining the Commission from taking any action against the petitioner under the provisions of Act XXX of 1947 on the ground that the provisions of sections 51 5467 and 8 of Act XXX of 1947 had become void being discriminatory in character after the coming into force of the Constitution of India.
The object of the Act as stated in its Preamble was to ascertain whether the actual incidence of taxation on income in recent years had been in accordance with 451 provisions of law and whether the procedure for assessment and recovery of tax was adequate to prevent evasion thereof.
2The Commission shall also have power to administer oaths and shall have all the powers of a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 for the purposes of taking evidence on oath enforcing the attendance of witnesses and of persons whose cases are being investigated compelling the production of documents and issuing commissions for the examination of witnesses.
said that there was no substantial difference in the procedure prescribed under section 34 of the Indian Income tax Act and the impugned Act and that in any case the procedure prescribed by the Act was a good substitute for that prescribed by the Indian Income tax Act.
