The suit out of which appeal No 887 has arisen was filed by the respondent against the State of Rajasthan.
The respondent was a resident of the former Dholpur State and the dispute which led to the suit related to a time before the merger of former Dholpur State into the Matsya Union.
The suits were resisted by the State of Rajasthan on various grounds but we are concerned now only with one ground which alone has been urged before us namely that the State of Rajasthan was not bound by any liability which might have arisen against the former State of Dholpur.
In reply to this contention of the State the respondent relied on article 2952 of the Constitution and other provisions made during the period when mergers were taking place after August 15 1947 and contended that in view of article 2952 of the Constitution the State of Rajasthan was bound by the obligation of the former State of Dholpur.
In this State of United State of Rajasthan the State of Matsya merged in May 1949 and thus the former State of Dholpur came to be included in the United State of Rajasthan through the Matsya Union.
When this merger took place it is not in dispute that the exis ting laws were to continue till they were repealed or altered by the new State.
The only question that has been raised before us on behalf of the appellant is about the liability of the State of Rajasthan under article 2952 of the Constitution in respect of the obligations of the former State of Dholpur which came to be 179 included in the State of Rajasthan on account of political changes to which we have already referred.
