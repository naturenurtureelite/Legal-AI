It consists of eight district and sessions judges two additional district and sessions judges secretary to government in law department superintendent and legal remembrancer law department deputy secretary to government in the law department member administrative tribunal and the Registrar of the Orissa High Court in all 15 in number.
Out of these the district and sessions judges and additional district and sessions judges were discharging purely judicial functions.
In Orissa as in most of the other States that practice continued till the decision of tiffs Court in the State of Assam vs Ranga Mahammad and others1.
It appears that for some time past there were differences between the High Court and the government about the posting of some of the judicial officers.
district judges as the case may be after they had held those posts for three years or more.
Consequently the sessions divisions of Ganjam Boudh Mayurbhanj Keonjhar and Bolangir Kalahandi were without district and sessions judges for several days.
Shri Sarjoo Prasad learned counsel for the High Court of Orissa at the very commencement of his arguments conceded that the order of the High Court holding that those officers had no authority to hold the posts in question is unsustainable.
Those posts are similar to.
the High Court must also have the power to fill up the post of the Registrar as that is also Included in the cadre.
