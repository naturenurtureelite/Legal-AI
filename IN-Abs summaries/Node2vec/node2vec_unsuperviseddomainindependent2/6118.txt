The Judgment of the Court was delivered by K JAGANNATHA SHETTY J.
They are termed as daily rated employees.
In this petition under Article 32 of the Constitution they are seeking enforcement of their fundamental right to have equal pay for equal work.
They want the same pay of the regular employees as carpenters or in the alternative the minimum wages prescribed by the Deputy Commissioner for like categories of workmen.
The Corporation has resisted the petitioners  claim.
The Government has not fixed the mini mum wages payable to the petitioners engaged in the Corpora tion or other like industries but the Corporation has adopted the minimum wages payable for similar work in the construction industry.
The Corporation has clearly stated that there are no regular employees of the petitioners  categories in its establishment and as such the question of payment to the petitioners the pay admissible to regular employees does not arise.
It is thus a service oriented organisation helping the village artisans and craftsmen to produce and market their products on remunerative prices.
It is said that the village artisans and craftsmen make different items on a piece rate basis and in some cases they execute the work in their own homes.
The Court therefore directed the Central Government to fix the pay scale of the petitioner on par with his counterparts doing identical work under the same employer.
The Court while rejecting the claim expressed the view at 100 But equal pay must depend upon the nature of the work done it cannot be judged by the mere volume of work there may be qualitative difference as regards reliability and responsibility.
exhibit P 2 was issued by the Deputy Commissioner in the exercise of his powers under the HP Financial Rules.
