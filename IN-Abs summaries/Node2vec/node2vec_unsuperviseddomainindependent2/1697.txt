The question in these appeals is whether on the facts to be presently stated the appellant was entitled to relief under section 254 of the Income tax Act 1922.
It is on this basis that it claimed the benefit of section 25 4 of the Act.
Thereafter on April 27 1934 Purusbotham died and the firm was then left with three partners namely Nagjee Narayanjee and Maneklal.
It is on this instrument that the appellant which is the firm constituted by Maneklal Jayanand Leeladhar and Prabhulal claimed relief under section 254 in its assessment for the years 1948 49 and 1949 50.
This is clear from the terms of the instrument which we have earlier set out.
The recital provides that the remaining partners of the firm constituted by the instrument of 1918 agreed to carry on and continue the existing partnership business.
On May 30 1939 two 110 deeds were executed.
In Cl the preamble was as follows Whereas Partners 1 to 4 have been carrying on a business as Partners from the beginning of Samvat 1994 Guzarathi Era in the manufacture and sale of Soaps under the name of The Vegetable Soap Works Proprietors Sait Nagjee Purushotham  Co and in the manufacture and sale of Umbrellas in Calicut with branches at Madras and Bombay under the name and style of Sait Nagjee Purushotham  Co Soap and Umbrella Merchants at Calicut and Madras and in the name of Sha Nagjee Purushotham  Co at Bombay hereinafter called the Firm.
