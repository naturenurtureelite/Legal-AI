The constitutional validity of section 151a of the Punjab Preemption Act 1913 was challenged on the ground that it offended the fundamental right guaranteed by Article 191f m Ram Sarup vs Munshi  Ors A Constitution Bench of this Court upheld the validity holding that there was no infringement of Article 1911  of the Constitution.
Where the sale is of a share out of joint land or property and is not made by all the co sharers jointly only the other co sharers and the tenants can exercise the right of pre emption.
Where the sale is of a land or proper ty owned jointly and is made by all the co sharers jointly the right to pre empt survives to the tenants only.
Read in the context it becomes clear that the legislature desired to confer the right of pre emption on specified family members of the vendor or vendors in the first three clauses of section 151b and with a view to covering all the remaining co sharers not specifically mentioned the preceding clauses it used the expression other co sharers  in the fourth clause which was meant to serve as a residuary clause to ensure 127 that no co sharer is left out.
