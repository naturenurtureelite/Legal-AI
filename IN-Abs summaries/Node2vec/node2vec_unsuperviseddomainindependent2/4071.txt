5 6 in CA 161779.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMIAH J.
For the purpose of holding election to the .
The final publication of the electoral roll under Rule 8 of the Rules was done on November 16 1978.
Thereafter the calendar of events was published on November 25 1978 notifying that the poll if necessary would take place on December 31 1978 in all the 44 constituencies Six petitioners including the appellants herein presented a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Jabalpur on December 28 1978 requesting the Court to make an order quashing the electoral roll and the calendar of events issued for the purpose of the said election and directing the respondents to refrain from conducting the poll on December 31 1978.
Their names were however not published under Rule 46 of the Rules in view of the interim order made by the Court.
Thereafter the successful candidates were also impleaded as respondents and the petition was amended by the inclusion of an additional prayer that the declaration of the results of the election should also be quashed.
It was also alleged that on October 20 1978 34 persons mentioned in Annexure P 7 approached the Deputy Collector to entertain their claim for inclusion in the electoral roll and he refused to receive their applications.
The claim of petitioner No 5 was rejected as no evidence in support of his claim was produced before the Deputy Collector.
It was further pleaded that no other claims or objections were preferred either on October 20 1978 or on any other sub sequent date.
The petitioners were not entitled to any relief under Article 226 of the Constitution on account of the inordinate delay involved in the presentation of the writ petition.
It is not the case of the petitioners that they did not know immediately after the publication of such notice that in the said notice a period of 20 days had been mentioned in its preamble as the period within which the claims and objections could be preferred and in paragraph 7 thereof it had been stated that any such claim or objection filed beyond the prescribed period was liable to be rejected.
If they felt that the said notice suffered from any illegality they could have brought it to the notice of the Collector immediately 496 thereafter.
It was notified that the nominations could be filed on and after November 25 1978 and the poll if necessary would take place on December 31 1978.
By that time the nominations had all been received.
On the facts and in the circumstances of the case we are of the view that the writ petition was rightly dismissed by the High Court as there was no satisfactory explanation for the delay in preferring it.
