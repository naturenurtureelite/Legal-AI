It also laid down the principle enabling the actual fitment of the workmen in their respective wage scales as on that date and also provided for the number of increments to which they would be entitled having regard to the period of completed service.
No dearness allowance was paid until the beginning of 1977 and the house rent allowance also was introduced about that time.
The Tribunal has referred to various considerations which prevailed with it in giving retrospectivity to the revised pay scales.
It is to the task of revising the pay scales that the Tribunal addressed itself and throughout the material part of the award it is that task which held its focussed attention.
And that is confirmed by what was stated in paragraph 23 of the award Considering this outgoing the flat increase of Rs 150 in the category of Draughtsman and Rs 100 in the case of the other categories would be fair.
The revised pay scales of all categories except the category of Draughtsmen shows an increase of Rs 100 in the initial pay fixed in each scale the increase in the case of the category of Draughtsmen being Rs 150 .
The amendment made by the Tribunal has the effect of providing a second increase this time to each individual workmen.
Again if the flat increase is Rs 65 per month to the individual workmen of all categories the additional load would total Rs 497772 .
In travelling outside and beyond the terms of the original award the Tribunal has committed a jurisdictional error.
Accordingly the appeal filed by the workmen must fail.
In the result Civil Appeal No 2299 of 1979 is allowed in part insofar that the order dated 22nd December 1978 of the Industrial Tribunal Maharashtra Bombay is quashed to the extent that it modifies the original award dated 20th December 1978 and the corrigendum made consequent thereto is also quashed.
In our opinion Civil Appeal No 2299 of 1979 should be dismissed in its entirety.
In the said award Your Honour has observed at the end of Para 22 In view of the increase that is being allowed in the basic pay I do not propose to revise the existing scheme of Dearness Allowance .
Thereafter the Tribunal made an order on the same day in the following terms There can be no doubt that a flat increase of Rs 150 to each of the employees in the category of Draftsmen and 181 of Rs 100 to each employee in the other categories has been granted under my award.
On the other hand the endorsement reads as if there was tacit agreement on the part of the Company to the correction sought by the union.
Even so we propose to examine whether the correction sought by the employees union was within the bounds of the authority of the Tribunal or whether it was in effect a fresh award.
For some years to come this is likely to be one of the few Consulting Engineers who will be securing major contracts.
Finally at the end of paragraph 21 the Tribunal said  In view of this position the Company can easily bear some burden that might fall as a result of the upward revision of the wage scales.
Fitment If as on 1st January 1976 an employee is drawing a salary less than the beginning of the respective grade he should be first stepped up to the beginning of the grade.
In the case of several senior employees the revised scale would yield but a very small and almost a token increase in the size of the pay packet whereas the junior employees would get a large benefit.
As it has now turned out what the employees apparently suspected the employer might contend is precisely what the employer is not contending though the employer did not choose to so contend before the Industrial Tribunal itself when the employees filed the application for rectification.
The omission of the words to each employee first after the figure Rs 150 and again after the figure Rs 100 was clearly an accidental slip or omission which the Tribunal was entitled to correct.
We are unable to see how it can be held to be otherwise.
ORDER In view of the opinion of the majority both the appeals are dismissed and there is no order as to costs.
