P R Das and K P Khaitan B Sen A K Mukherjea and B P Maheswari with them for the petitioner.
The principal question canvassed in this case is whether certain sections of the Taxation on Income Investigation Commission Act 1947 ie Act XXX of 1947 have become void from the date of the commencement of the Constitution of India by reason of article 14 of the  Constitution.
It was further.
said that there was no substantial difference in the procedure prescribed under section 34 of the Indian Income tax Act and the impugned Act and that in any case the procedure prescribed by the Act was a good substitute for that prescribed by the Indian Income tax Act.
On a plain reading of the section it is clear that the subsection is not limited only to persons who made extraordinary profits and to a substantial extent evaded payment of taxation on income but applies to all persons who may have evaded payment of taxation on income irrespective of whether the evaded profits are substantial or insubstantial.
We thus hold that both section 34 of the Indian Income tax Act and sub section 4 of 462 section 5 of the impugned Act deal with all persons who have similar characteristics and similar properties the common characteristics being that they are persons who have not truly disclosed their income and have evaded payment of taxation on income.
