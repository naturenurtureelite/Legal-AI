article 332 of the Constitution provides that seats shall be reserved for the Scheduled Castes in the Legislative Assembly of every State.
In the election petition the respondent had stated that the appellant was a member of the Saha caste and not a member of any Schedule Caste.
Nobody disputes that.
If Sunri is a caste the word Saha  in the expression excluding Saha in the item must without more.
the other must be a caste.
The error of the Tribunal lay in interpreting the Order in the light of the evidence before it.
There was no justification for doing that.
In the absence of such words Saha must in the context be understood as referring to a smaller caste group within the bigger caste group of Sunris.
It is of interest to remind in the connection that the Order provides that the Sunris in the Purulia District and those parts of the Purnea District which had been transferred to West Bengal were not to be considered as belonging to a Scheduled Caste.
These witnesses were disbelieved by the Tribunal which described them as unreliable.
One set of hearing fees only.
Appeal No 1149 of 1965 dismissed.
