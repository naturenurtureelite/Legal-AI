iminal Appeal No 46 of 1957.
Hardayal Hardy for the appellants.
H J Umrigar and B H Dhebar for the respondent.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR J.
The Chief Presidency Magistrate acquitted all the accused including the appellants and held that as the conciliation proceedings had continued for a period of more than 14 days as from January 17 1952 further proceedings for conciliation were illegal and therefore the accused persons could not be convicted under section 311of the Act.
The State took an appeal to the High Court and the judgment of acquittal was reversed and of the accused persons the two appellants were convicted and the others were acquitted.
The two appellants have appealed by special leave.
Section 311 makes the contravention of the provision 737 of section 33 of the Act an offence punishable with imprisonment for a period which may extend to six months or with fine or with both.
The argument raised on behalf of the appellant is that the object of conciliation is to get a settlement made with expedition and therefore under section 12 the Conciliation Officer was bound to make his report within 14 days of the commencement of the conciliation proceedings or within such shorter period fixed by the appropriate Government.
The Act provides for commencement and conclusion of conciliation proceedings under section 20 but the first sub section of section 20 deals with what are called utility services and sub section 2 of that section provides as to when the conciliation proceedings conclude.
The provisions of sub section 2 apply to all conciliation proceedings whether in regard to utility services or otherwise.
