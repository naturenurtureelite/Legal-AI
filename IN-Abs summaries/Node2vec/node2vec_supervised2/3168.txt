N Criminal Appeal No 34 of 1970.
This is an appeal against the judgment of the Full Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court reported in AIR 1970 AP 70.
Under this category fall the decisions in Dulal Chandra Bhar vs Slate of West Bengal5 and Gopal Khaitan vs State 6 of the Calcutta High Court.
Ramachandra  Sons P Ltd vs StateT of the Allahabad High Court State vs T C Printers P Ltd 8 of the Rajasthan 1 ILR  2 1875 L R 10 Q B 329.
We may now refer to some of the earlier decisions on this Point.
7 ILR 1918 Calcutta 486.
It may be that copies of the balance sheet so laid before the general body may have been forwarded under sub section 1 of Section 134 of the Old Companies Act or sub section 1 of section 220 of the Act but nonetheless if the requirements of sub section 2 of the respective sections have not been complied with even then the persons concerned would be liable for punishment for that default.
Under section 133 the failure to comply with section 131 is made punishable.
In that case any failure to do so would be punishable and the question whether a general body meeting had been held and the balance sheet and profit and loss account have been laid before it Will not arise.
It is interesting to note that it was argued in Park vs Lawton2 that the fact that section 26 makes the offence a continuing one also shows that the obligation to file the list is independent of the holding of a general meeting.
