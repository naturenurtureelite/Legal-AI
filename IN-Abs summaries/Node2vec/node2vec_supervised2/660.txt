section K Venkataranga Iyengar and K Keshava Iyengar for the appellant.
Mr Iyengar for the appellant has strongly urged before us that since these facts are established the court must presume the valid execution of the will and in support of his contention he has invited our attention to the relevant statements on the point in the text books dealing with the subject.
The sixth was whether the testator knew and approved of the residuary clause and by this last clause the propounders of the will were made the residuary legatees and were appointed executors.
The case of Shama Charn Kundu vs Khettromoni Dasi 1 on the other hand was the case of a will the execution of which was held to be not surrounded by any suspicious circumstances.
It would be difficult to deduce any principle from this decision and to seek to apply it to other cases without reference to their facts.
Then two nurses were called in to witness its due execution.
It is common ground that Mandya where the testatrix was lying ill is a place where the assistance of local lawyers would have been easily available and in ordinary course the testatrix would have talked to Kalbagal and the appellant and they would have secured the assistance of the lawyers for drafting the will but that is not what the appellant did.
