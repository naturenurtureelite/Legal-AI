I N Shroff for respondent No 1.
Before we deal with the above points we may give a few facts.
The Gondal State merged with the United States of Saurashtra.
On March 7 1954 he was served with a charge sheet.
He was also allowed to appear through an Advocate in the enquiry proceedings.
The Enquiry Officer made a report and on or about January 7 1955 the following notice was issued to him calling upon him to show cause why he should not be dismissed from service To Shri Bhaishanker A Joshi Accountant Rajkot Central Prison Under suspension Charges framed against you under this office No C 14 dated 27 3 54 and in particular the charges of having accepted illegal gratification from prisoner Ratilal Jivan have been established to the satisfaction of Government.
Moreover as pointed out by the High Court the Inspector General of Prisons had the report before him and the tentative conclusions arrived at by the Enquiry Officer were bound to influence him and in depriving the plaintiff of a copy of the report he was handicapped is not knowing what material was influencing the Inspector General of Prisons.
Authority is not lacking even in England where a special relationship exists between the Crown and its public servants.
If the terms of the appointment definitely prescribe a term and expressly provide for a power to determine for cause it appears necessarily to follow that any implication of a power to dismiss at pleasure is excluded.
He would claim on a quantum mersuit and I am fortified in this view by Reilly vs R 2 by R vs Doultre4 and by Bushe vs R5 referred to in Robertson s book at p 338 11956 1 All ER 807 811 12.
2  179.
3 1953 2QB482499.
RKPS Appeal dismissed.
