Civil No 548 of 1987.
MC Dhingra for the Petitioners.
Kapil Sibal KG Bhagat AK Ganguli Ms Kamini Jaiswal 664 Ms Aruna Mathur A Mariarputham Harminder Lal and Naresh K Sharma for the Respondents.
They are termed as daily rated employees.
The petitioners are treated as industrial workmen and are given all benefits due to them under the various labour legislations.
It is thus a service oriented organisation helping the village artisans and craftsmen to produce and market their products on remunerative prices.
With these facts we may now turn to the principle upon which the petitioners  case is rested.
The principle of equal pay for equal work is not one of the fundamental rights expressly guaranteed by our Constitution.
There the petitioner was a Hearing Therapist in the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.
He claimed pay scale admissible to Senior Speech Pathologist Senior Physiotherapist Senior Occupational Therapist Audiologist and Speech Pathologist.
But the Court held that the principle of equal pay for equal work cannot be invoked invariably in every kind of service particularly in the area of professional services.
It was also held 667 that it is open to the State to classify employees on the basis of qualifications duties and responsibilities of the posts concerned.
From the averments in the pleadings of the parties it will be clear that the Corporation has no regularly employed carpenters.
The two jobs by the mere nomen clature or by the volume of work performed cannot be rated as equal.
It cannot be evaluated by the mere averments in the self serving affidavits or counter affidavits of the parties.
The petition ers have been treated as construction workers and they are being paid the minimum wages admissible to such workmen.
