With a view to preventing any such action on the part of the defendants he instituted the suit for an injunction to restrain them from so doing.
The court came to the conclusion that a mere declaration of his status as a tenant could not be granted unless the consequential relief for possession was prayed.
In the previous suit the relief for possession was not claimed whereas in the second suit the relief was for restoration of possession.
Sub section 2 of section 8 next provides that where any person as is referred to in section 4 deemed tenant has been evicted from the land on or after 1st July 1962 such person shall be entitled to recover immediate possession of the land in the manner prescribed by or under the Act unless the landlord proves that the termination of tenancy was in the manner authorised by section 9.
Three situations therefore develop in the context of the provisions of the Act as amended by the Fifth Amendment namely i the Civil Court retains jurisdiction or ii the Civil Court is precluded from deciding even incidentally questions failing within the ambit of section 7 of the Act or iii the Civil Court s jurisdiction is wholly ousted.
In such a situation what procedure should the Civil Court follow  Now take a case where the entire dispute falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the special machinery under the Act and had the litigation commenced after the Fifth Amendment was brought into force it could not have been instituted in a Civil Court.
Section 82 has limited operation where a person referred to in section 4 has been evicted on or after 1st July 1962.
Section 851 laid down that no Civil Court shall have jurisdiction to settle decide or deal with any question which is required to be settled decided or dealt with by the Mamlatdar under the statute.
