This Part consists of rules 21 to 35 and two Schedules.
Rate of octroi Octroi may be levied by a panchayat after following the procedure prescribed in rules 3 and 4 on all or any of the goods specified in column 1 of Schedule 1 annexed to this Part which are imported into the octroi limits for consumption use or sale therein and at such rates as may be decided by it but not below the minimum and not exceeding the maximum rates specified in columns 2 and 3 respectively of that Schedule.
The scheme of the Fees Rules accordingly seems to be that the general procedure for levying taxes or fees is laid down and then this procedure is made applicable to the levy of various taxes mentioned in the other parts of the Rules.
Under r3d what the panchayat does is to consider objections and suggestions and then finally make the choice as regards two things ie the tax or fee to be imposed and the rate at which it is to be levied.
Para 2 of the return only alleged This respondent says that at that time no copy of the Rules required to be published by Rule 4 of the Rules was exhibited along with the said Notice.
Rule 5 follows imme diately rr3 and 4 and is headed Appeal against levy of any tax or fee and the period of sixty days of limitation commences from the date of the publication of the notice under r4 ie the notice following the decision of a Panchayat to levy any tax or fee.
This date shows that r5 is dealing only with appeals against levy of any tax and not with the assessment or imposition of a tax or any further appeals to the Panchayat Simiti under section 1245.
