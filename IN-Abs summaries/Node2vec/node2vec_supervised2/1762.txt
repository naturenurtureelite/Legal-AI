March 12 1964.
The respondent claimed refund of Rs 20855 along with interest and costs.
In 1948 however the process of merger in Rajasthan began and the 177 first merger that took place was of the former States of Alwar Bharatpur Dholpur and Karauli which formed the Matsya Union as from March 18 1948 by a Covenant entered on February 28 1948.
Then came another union of certain other Rulers in Rajasthan in March 1948 by which these Rulers united under the Ruler of Udaipur to form what later came to be known as the Former State of Rajasthan.
There was also a provision in the Covenant by which the assets and liabilities of the covenanting States became the assets and liabilities of the new State.
It is also not in dispute that the assets and liabilities of the Matsya Union were taken over as the assets and liabilities of the United State of Rajasthan in which the Matsya Union merged.
The first was that each time a merger took place the new State by a provision in the Covenant took over the assets and liabilities of the merging States.
In this connection we may also refer to section 3 of the Raja sthan Administration Ordinance No 1 of 1949 which conti nued existing laws of the old States till they were altered by the competent legislature or other competent authority in the new State.
In the present case we have only the continuance of the old laws and the valuable evidence afforded by article VI of the Covenant and there is nothing to show that the right to claim refund was taken away by any law competently passed.
Res pondent in Appeal No 887 will get his costs from the appel lant.
