ivil Appeals Nos 259 and 260 of 1958.
Appeals by special leave from the judgment and orders dated August 5 1955 of the former Travancore Cochin High Court in Income tax Reference Appeals Nos 6 of 1953 and 21 of 1954.
In Appeal No 260 58 a further question arose whether in the case of 259 that assessee the year ending June 30 1949 was the previous year for the assessment year 1950 51 with the result that it should be assessed under the Indian Income tax Act of 1922.
In C A No 25958 the assessee is a public limited company incorporated in the State of Cochin with branches in that State as well as in what was British India and in Travancore State.
The Income tax Officer determined its assessable income to be Rs 90947 representing only the profit it made in Travancore State and under section 321 proviso 1 of the Travancore Act he refused a deduction of Rs 79275 shown as loss from branches situate outside the State of Travancore in British India and other Indian States.
The assessment was made under the Travancore Act and relates to the previous year ending June 30 1949 the assessment year being 1950 51.
The Appellate Tribunal also did not accept the submissions of the assessee and upheld the order of assessment.
Sections in brackets are the corresponding sections of the Indian Act.
So the only difference between the two sections is that in the proviso to section 241 of the Indian Act instead of the words an Indian State the words British India or in an Indian State  have to be substituted.

Section 3 provided for the charge of income tax in respect of the total income of the previous year.
Under section 4 the total income of any previous year of any person who was resident included all income profits and gains from whatever source derived but i it must accrue or arise to him during the year in British India or ii accrue or arise to him without British India during such year.
263 there were six heads of income chargeable to income tax.
Such sums were to be takeninto account for the purpose of determining the rate under section 16 of the Indian Act.
This section was introduced in 1922 before which under the Indian Act of 1918 a loss under one head of income could not be set off against income under another head the taxability of income arising from each head being separate.

268 off except against profits and gains accruing or arising in an Indian State from the same business profession or vocation and exempt from tax under the said provisions .
Section 10 of the Indian Act does not distinguish between business in British India and business in an Indian State or so divide business.
In the course of argument a number of cases of the various High Courts were cited and criticised.
In our view the question referred to the High Court which is common to the two appeals was rightly answered in favour of the assessee.
