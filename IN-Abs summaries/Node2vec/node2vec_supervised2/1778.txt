The short question which arises in this appeal is whether the term wages as defined by section 2vi of the No 4 of 1936 hereinafter called the Act  includes wages fixed by an award in an industrial dispute between the employer and his employees.
The subsequent amendment expressly provides by section 2vi a that any remuneration payable under any award or settlement between the parties or order of a Court would be included in the main definition under section 2vi.
The point which we have to decide in the present appeal is whether the remuneration payable under an award was not already included in the definition of wages before the said definition was amended.
The High Court has affirmed the finding of the authority and held that section 15 was applicable to the case because the wages prescribed by the award did amount to wages as defined by section 2vi of the Act.
The development of industrial law during the last decade bears testimony to the fact that on references made under section 101 of the Industrial Disputes Act terms of employment have constantly been examined by industrial adjudication and wherever it appeared appropriate to make changes in them they have been made in accordance with the well recognised principles of fair play and justice to both the parties.
