The assessee appealed to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner who held that the alleged cash grant of varying and unspecified amount received by the appellant in relation to land revenue of Seyedpur now Tehsil of District Ghazipur clearly fell within the definition of agricultural income under Section 21 of the Incometax Act The Income tax Officer appealed to the Income tax Appellate Tribunal.
We respectfully adopt the reasoning and conclusion of this Court in the case of State of  704 Uttar Pradesh vs Kunwar Sri Trivikram Narain Singh1 and hold that the respondent under the arrangement had no interest in land or in the land revenue payable in respect thereof.
To call a payment a loan if it is really an annuity does not assist the taxpayer any more than to call an item a capital payment would prevent it from being regarded as an income payment if that is its true nature.
 He therefore asked us to disregard the word pension  in the letter dated July 7 1837 and determine the real character of the payment.
If the other method is adopted tax will not be payable .
The position will be different if he exchanges 1 30 TC II.
Mr Sastri relying on Perrin vs Dickson1 contends that an annuity is not always taxable as income.
