The suit out of which appeal No 887 has arisen was filed by the respondent against the State of Rajasthan.
Provision was also made in the Covenant that all the assets and liabilities of the covenanting States shall be the assets and liabilities of the new State of Matsya.
But whereas in the present case the old laws were to continue till they were repealed or altered it follows in our opinion that the rights arising under the old laws in the subjects of the merging States would continue and these subjects would have the same rights against the new State as they would have under the old laws against the merging State.
This is the basic difference between the Dalmia Dadri Cement Company case1 and the present case for in that case the old laws were repealed and thus repudiated in areas other than Patiala State while in the present case the old laws were continued till they were repealed or altered and in view of that basic difference between that case and the present case we can legitimately call in aid article VI of the Covenant and similar provisions which were always made throughout this process of merger in Rajasthan and treat them as evidence from which to come to the conclusion that the new State by continuing the old laws without change till they were repealed or altered recognised that it was liable in the same way as would have been the merging State if there was any liability on the merging State.
But this was of course subject to any law made by the new State repealing the old laws and the liabilities arising there under or even otherwise provided the law so made was within the competence of the new State and after the Constitution came into force it did not transgress the constitutional limitations.
