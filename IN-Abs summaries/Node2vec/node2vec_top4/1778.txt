March 24 1964.
The point which we have to decide in the present appeal is whether the remuneration payable under an award was not already included in the definition of wages before the said definition was amended.
Mr Setalvad for the appellant contends that before it is held that the wages prescribed by the award fall under section 2vi it must be shown that they constitute part of the terms of the contract of employment either express or implied.
The terms in question need not be express and can be implied but they must be terms which arise out of the contract of employment and since an award made by an Industrial Tribunal cannot be said to amount to a contract of employment the wage structure prescribed by the award cannot fall within the definition prescribed by section 2vi.
That in brief is the substance of the argument raised by the appellant.
In Jogendra Nath 1 AIR 1964 SC 15.
In our opinion the Bombay view correctly represents the true legal position in the matter.
The matter will now go back to the authority under the Act for disposal in accordance with law.
