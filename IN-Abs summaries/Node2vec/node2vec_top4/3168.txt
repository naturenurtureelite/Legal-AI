Solicitor General who appeared for the State of Andhra Pradesh and the learned Solicitor General who appeared for the Advocate General of Andhra Pradesh fairly placed before this Court all the decisions for and against which we have already referred to and also placed before us all the relevant considerations.
It was urged before us that the principle accepted by this Court in The State of Bombay vs Bandhan Ram Bhandani  Ors.
The responsibility of sending three copies of the balance sheet and profit and loss account or the income and expenditure account as the case may be arises only after they have been laid before the company at the general meeting.
Therefore the condition precedent or the essential prerequisite of the balance sheet and the profit and loss account being laid before the general meeting of the company not being fulfilled the requirement of section 134 cannot be complied with.
It is interesting to note that it was argued in Park vs Lawton2 that the fact that section 26 makes the offence a continuing one also shows that the obligation to file the list is independent of the holding of a general meeting.
