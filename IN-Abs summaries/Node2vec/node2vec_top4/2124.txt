At the hearing of the petition by the Election Tribunal however he challenged the election only on the ground that Abhoy Pada was a member of the Saha caste and not a member of a Scheduled Caste.
In the election petition the respondent had stated that the appellant was a member of the Saha caste and not a member of any Schedule Caste.
In our view it was open to the respondent to show that the appellant belonged to the Saha caste group within the Sunri caste group and did not therefore belong to the Schedule Caste specified in item 40 as he claimed.
The Tribunal came to its conclusion that Saha in the item referred to a caste distinct from the Sunri caste because the evidence before it did not show that there was within the Sunri caste a smaller caste group called Sahas.
If the correct interpretation of item 40 was as we think it was that Sahas were a caste group within the Sunri caste no question of Sahas being a distinct class independent of Sunris could arise.
