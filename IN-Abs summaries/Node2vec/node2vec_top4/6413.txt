PW 3 the Principal of the training school issued exhibit P 2 show cause notice to the PW 1 Venkataswamy the canteen contractor as to why his licence for running the canteen should not be cancelled.
The latter made a complaint to PW 6 who thereupon arranged a trap.
At the trial the prosecution witnesses supported the case.
The case of Dipawali gift or return of a loan given to PW 1 has not been even suggested.
It cannot therefore be said that there had been consistent explanation for the appellant.
This conduct of the appellant is clearly incon sistent with the transaction of loan or return of money by PW 1 338 This Court observed in Dhanvantrai Balwantrai Desai vs State of Maharashtra AIR 1964 SC 575 as under Where any gratification other than legal gratification or any valuable thing is proved to have been received by an accused person the court is required to draw a presumption that the person received that thing as a motive of reward such as is mentioned in section 161 IPC Therefore the Court has no choice in the matter once it is established that the accused person has received a sum of money which was not due to him as a legal remuneration.
The burden resting on the accused person in such a case would not be as light as it is where a presumption is raised under section 114 of Evidence Act and cannot be held to be discharged merely by reason of the fact that the explanation offered by the accused is reasonable and probable.
The words unless the contrary is proved  which occur in this provision make it clear that the presumption has to be rebutted by proof  and not by a bare explanation which is merely plausible.
 On a careful consideration of the facts and circum stances we are not satisfied that the appellant had even by preponderance of probability succeeded in rebutting the presumption.
