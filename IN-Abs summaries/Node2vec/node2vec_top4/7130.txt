The first ground on which the High Court dismissed the suit is that the suit was barred by the principle of res judicata in view of the dismissal of the former suit No 15768.
Therefore the second suit is to be deemed as barred by res judicata  With respect it is difficult to accept this line of reasoning.
To preclude the plaintiff from so doing it is provided that if he omits any part of the claim or fails to claim a remedy available to him in respect of that cause of action he will thereafter be precluded from so doing in any subsequent litigation that he may commence if he has not obtained the prior permission of the court.
Section 58 bars the jurisdiction of courts.
Since the civil court had lost jurisdiction to decide the suit the High Court dismissed it.
Thus said this Court the language of the sub section applies equally to suits pending when Part 11 comes into force and those to be filed subsequently.
Section 82 has limited operation where a person referred to in section 4 has been evicted on or after 1st July 1962.
We are therefore of the opinion that it would be just and fair that the issue whether defendant No1 was a tenant in respect of the lands in question should be referred to the Mamlatdar for decision and after his decision is received by the Civil Court if the issue is held against defendant No1 the Civil Court may consider passing of a decree in eviction but if on the other hand he is held to be tenant the Civil Court may be required to dismiss the suit.
His remedy would therefore to be entirely under the Act.
