The Reference was numbered I T No 292 of 1975.
Reference was made to the political uncertainty in Iran which had placed an appreciable part of the appellant s business in jeopardy and to various other factors peculiar to an engineering consultancy business beyond the appellant s control.
There was no separate dearness allowance until January 1977 when it was introduced for the first time.
It decided also that there was no ground for deducting the notional value of gratuity.

The Tribunal maintained the existing schemes of dearness allowance and house rent allowance and observed that in view of the revised basic wages there would be a resultant increase in the dearness allowance and house rent allowance.
I do not think that any problem would arise for interpretation of the award.
The challenge embodied in the second contention against the amendment of the award is more serious.
 The jurisdiction given to the Tribunal by rule 31 is closely circumscribed.
In its order of 22nd December 1978 the Tribunal has referred to the statement Exhibit C 51 filed by the appellant when called upon to indicate the increased financial burden apprehended by it.
It seems from a perusal of the document Exhibit C 51 that it is a statement giving trial figures of the increased financial load on different bases.
On the basis that a sum of Rs 150 per month was added to the pay of each Draughtsman and a sum of Rs 100 was added to the pay of every other workman who belonged to the Union staff the financial load would increase to Rs 922032 .
Finally on the basis that the individual Draughtsman would be given an increase of Rs 75 per month and the individual workmen of other categories Rs 50 per month the additional load was calculated at Rs 463092 .
It seems that the Tribunal was betrayed by a curious confusion in accepting the plea of the Union that a flat increase to the pay of each workman was intended in the original wage and consequently it fell into the error of amending the award.
The original award was completed and signed by the Tribunal and it cannot be reopened now except for the limited purpose of Rule 31.
It noted that dearness allowance was being granted by the appellant at 10 of the salary subject to a minimum of Rs 50 and house rent allowance at 30 of the basic salary.
It is needless to recapitulate all the basic facts which have been set out in the judgment of Pathak J The Award of the Industrial Tribunal was made on December 20 1978.
I do not think that any problem would arise for interpretation of the award.
The endorsement made on the application by the Advocate for the company does not indicate that the company had any objection to the award being corrected as sought by the employees union.
On the other hand the endorsement reads as if there was tacit agreement on the part of the Company to the correction sought by the union.
Even so we propose to examine whether the correction sought by the employees union was within the bounds of the authority of the Tribunal or whether it was in effect a fresh award.
Implicit and intrinsically connected with the question of revision of the wage scales were the questions of fitment of employees into the wage scales and flat or ad hoc increase of salaries of workmen wherever considered necessary.
ii Employees who have completed 4 years of service as on 1st January 1976 2 increments.
iii All other employees with more than one year s service shall be given one increment.
We have already indicated that we agree with our brother Pathak J that the appeal Civil Appeal No 2300 of 1979 filed by the workmen should also be dismissed.
