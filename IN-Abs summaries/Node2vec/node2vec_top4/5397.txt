 The impugned notice ran thus No 3245266 EC.
 It is clear from it that the petitioner attained the age of 50 years on 1021972 and therefore on the date of the order he had completed the age of 54 years.
Admittedly he was holding a class II post when the impugned order was served on him.
In the instant case the petitioner was promoted as officiating Assistant Engineer which is a Class II post on 255.
The two Judge Bench which decided the case held  An officiating hand has no right to the post and is perhaps a fleeting.
Learned counsel for the petitioner does not dispute the position that a person who is in Class I or Class II service or post is in such service or post as covered by sub clause i.
The purpose of Fundamental Rules 56j is to confer power on the appropriate authority to compulsorily retire Government servant in the public interest and the classification of Government servants into two categories covered by sub clauses i and ii has a purpose behind it.
We would accordingly hold that the ratio of the decision in Tahiliani s case is not correct and sub clause i of Rule 56j applies to Government servants in Class I or Class II service or post on substantive temporary or offi ciating basis.
The petitioner would have superannuated from service on 2921980 if he had not been compulsorily retired with effect from 639 511 1976.
Even if the writ petition is allowed and the order of compulsory retirement is set aside the petitioner cannot go back to service.
