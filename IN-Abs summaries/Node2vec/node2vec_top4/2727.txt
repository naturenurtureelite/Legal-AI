The case of the appellant was that the trusteeship of the temple was hereditary.
The question to be considered in this appeal is whether the appellant is a hereditary trustee Within the meaning of the section.
The contention on behalf of the appellant is that the succession is regulated by usage.
In our opinion there is no warrant for this argument.
This is so whether the trustee has a beneficial interest of some sort or not see Ganesh Chunder Dhur vs Lal Behary2 and Bhabatarini vs Ashalata3.
In Sital Das vs Sant Ram5 the law was taken as wellsettled that succession to mahantship of a mutt or religious institution is regulated by custom or usage of the particular institution except where the rule of succession is laid down by the founder himself who created the endowment.
In that case the custom in 1 2 63 I A 448.
In Sri Mahant Paramanda Das Goswami vs Radhakrishna Das1 the Madras High Court took the view that where succession to the mahantship is by nomination by the holder in office it was not a hereditary succession.
Hereditary succession is succession by the heir to the deceased under the law the office must be transmitted to the successor according to some definite rules of descent which by their own force designate the person to succeed.
For these reasons we hold that this appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs.
