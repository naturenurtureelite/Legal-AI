Apart from giving training the Corporation also ensures marketing support to the artisans and craftsmen by purchasing their products at remunerative prices and sell them through the marketing network of the Corporation.
It is thus a service oriented organisation helping the village artisans and craftsmen to produce and market their products on remunerative prices.
With these facts we may now turn to the principle upon which the petitioners  case is rested.
It is therefore not impermissible to provide two different pay scales in the same cadre on the basis of selection based on merit with due regard to experience and seniority.
If the classification has reasonable nexus with the objective sought to be achieved efficiency in the administration the State would be justified in prescribing different pay scales.
Functions may be the same but the responsibilities make a difference.
So long as such value judgment is made bona fide reasonably on an intelligible criterion which has a rational nexus with the object of dif ferentiation such differentiation will not amount to discrimination.
We have carefully perused the material on record and gave our anxious consideration to the question urged.
A comparison cannot be made with counterparts in other establishments with different management or even in establishments in different geographical locations though owned by the same master.
They cannot claim wages payable to their counterparts in government service.
By the general description of their job one cannot come to the conclusion that every carpenter or craftsmen is equal to the other in the performance of his work.
In the result the petition fails and is dismissed.
