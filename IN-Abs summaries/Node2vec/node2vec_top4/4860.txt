He found accused 1 to 3 not guilty of charge No 2 framed against them in respect of the murder of Ashamati and accused 1 to 4 not guilty of charge No 3 framed against them in respect of the murder of Parubai and acquitted them.
The High Court acquitted accused 2 to 4 and convicted accused 1 alone of that charge and sentenced him holding that he and some others had conspired together and fabricated the deed of assignment put forward by accused 1 and that accused 1 alone could not have fabricated that document.
Mr Rana did not draw our attention in the course of his arguments to the fact that in charge No 1 even the approver PW 1 is alleged to have conspired with the seven accused to commit these three murders or contend that in view of that circumstance and the finding of the High Court that the approver PW 1 also was a party to the conspiracy the conviction of accused 5 alone of the charge of conspiracy under section 302 read with section 120B IPC could be sustained.
The High Court found that the evidence of PW 44 and 45 does not establish beyond reasonable doubt that accused 6 was found in the company of accused 7 and the approver PW 1 near about the place of occurrence as alleged by the prosecution before and after the murder of Malan.
