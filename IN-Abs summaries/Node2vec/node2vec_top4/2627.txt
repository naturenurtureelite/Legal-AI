Appeal No 1940 of 1967.
CI69 17 438 1955 and further confirmed by document dated December 1 1960 is not a lease 12.
The objection was raised as 439 an attempt to reopen the previous decision given by the Trial Judge refusing to try issues Nos 11 12  13 as preliminary issues.
Accordingly he held that the question asked in cross examination of the witnesses for Filmistan intended to secure disclosure of the surrounding circumstances and conduct of the parties in order to show in what manner the language of the document was related to the existing facts could not be excluded.
It is not open to any Court of law to try an issue over again or reopen the same if an earlier decision operates as res judicata.
The learned Judge will not proceed with the trial.
In the view of the Trial Court the question whether the legal relationship arising out of the agreement dated December 1 1960 was in the nature of a lease or of other character had to be decided at the trial and the previous judgment being a judgment by consent  could not operate as res judicata for it was not a decision of the Court and that the consent decree in suit No 149 of 1960 had not decided that the agreement dated March 27 1954 was of the nature of a lease and that in the plaint in that suit it was not even averred that it was a lease.
442 This Court observed in Major section section Khanna vs Brig.
