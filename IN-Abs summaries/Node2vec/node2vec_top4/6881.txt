This Court therefore upheld the constitutional validity of clause fourthly of section 151a clauses fourthly  and fifthly  of section 151b and clause fourthly of section 151c as valid and not infringing Articles 14 or 15 of the Constitution This Court however did not find any justification for the classification contained m section 15 which conferred a right of pre emption on the kinsfolk.
The right of pre emp tion vested in a tenant was sustained on the ground that 1 and reform legislations in regard to the tiller of the soil to obtain proprietary right in the soil with a view to ensuring his continuance in possession of the land and consequently of his livelihood without threat or disturbance from the superior proprietor.
Since this Court found certain intrinsic contradictions in the list of relatives covered by the first three clauses it saw no justification for the classification contained in the said provision conferring a right based on consanguinity and therefore struck down those clausesas discriminatory and violative of Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution.
What this Court disapproved as offen sive to Articles 14 and 15 is the classification based on consanguinity and not on co ownership.
That would clearly be discriminatory.
