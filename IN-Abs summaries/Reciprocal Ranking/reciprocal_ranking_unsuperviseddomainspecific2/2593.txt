The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Sikri J.
This appeal by special leave arises out of the suit filed by Bhaishankar Avalram Joshi hereinafter referred to as the plaintiff for a declaration that the order of dismissal dated February 24 1955 passed by the Inspector General of Prisons Saurashtra was illegal and void on the ground that it contravened the provisions of article 311 2 of the Constitution.
The plaintiff also prayed for a decree for Rs 2690 being arrears of his pay from April 1 1954 to May 7 1956.
The plaintiff failed before the Civil Judge Rajkot but on appeal succeeded before the District Judge Central Saurashtra inasmuch as he declared order dated February 24 1955 illegal and void.
The plaintiff appealed to the High Court claiming arrears of salary and the State of Bombay filed cross objections praying that the suit be dismissed.
The second appeal was heard by the High Court of Gujarat Miabhoy J who directed that the decree passed by the lower appellate court be varied so as to show that the appellant plaintiff continued to be in Government service till the date of the suit only and there will be a decree for Rs 2690 919 being arrears of pay due to the appellant plaintiff upto the date of the suit.
There will be a further provision in the decree that the liability arising out of the declaration that the appellant is in Government service is the liability of the State of Gujarat and that the liability for the payment of the arrears of pay is the liability of the State of Maharashtra.
The appeal is now before us.
