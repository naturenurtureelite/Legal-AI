March 12 1964.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by WANCHOO J.
These four appeals arise out of four certi ficates granted by the High Court of Rajasthan and raise a common question.
We therefore propose to set out facts in one of the present appeals No 887 as the facts in other appeals are similar except that the commodity involved was different and so was the amount in dispute.
The suit out of which appeal No 887 has arisen was filed by the respondent against the State of Rajasthan.
The case of the respondent was that in 1947 certain commodities including chuni with which appeal No 887 is concerned could only be exported from the former Dholpur State on export permits issued by the customs department of the said State.
Consequently in June 1947 the respondent applied for and was granted a permit for export of 15000 maunds of chuni and in connection therewith he deposited Rs 30000as export duty in advance.
The respondent s case further was that as he could not export the entire quantity of 15000 maunds for which he had paid export duty in advance at the rate of Rs 2 per maund he was entitled to refund of the proportionate export duty for the quantity of 10427 maunds and 20 seers which he could not export.
Eventually when the State refused to refund the amount the suit was filed out of which appeal No 887 has arisen in January 1952.
One 178 of the suits out of which appeal No 886 has arisen was ismissed by the trial Court.
