TS Krishnamurthy lyer MJ Paul and Kailash Vasudev for the Appellant.
K Parasaran PD Sharma TK Seshadri and K Swami for the Respondents.
549 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by RANGANATHAN J.
A very interesting question comes up for consideration in this appeal.
The question to be ultimately decided falls within a very narrow compass but it is neces sary to set out the facts leading to the present appeal at some length.
The property which is the subject matter of the present dispute originally formed part of an extent of land situat ed on Mount Road Madras bearing door Nos 2 and 3 and measuring 41 grounds and 2005 sq.
It belonged to several co owners.
These co owners had leased out the properties under two lease deeds in favour of Ms India Automobiles which was then the sole proprietary concern of one of them selves Ganshyamdas Girdhardas GG but was converted subsequently in 1961 into a partnership concern of GG and his four sons.
The firm and its partners arc hereinafter compendiously referred to as the tenants .
The first lease Ext.
P 1 was dated 229.
1947 and related to Door No 2 Item No1 in Schedule A to the plaint.
This was a property comprising of an area of 4 grounds and 151 square feet with certain buildings thereon.
The rent for the premises was Rs 150 per month.
The second lease deed Ext.
P 2 dated 310.
1947 relating to Door No 3 Item 2 in Schedule A to the plaint covered an area of 8700 sq.
and some building thereon.
On 3071953 all the co owners of the property includ ing GG sold the property to the United India Life Assur ance Company and the New Guardian of India Life Insurance Company Ltd In 1956 the Life Insurance Corporation of India LIC stepped into the shoes of these two insurance companies and became the owner of the property.
On 20765 the LIC moved two applications being HRC Nos 3310 and 3311 of 1965 in the court of the Rent Con troller Sri A Varadarajan who later became a Judge of the this Court for fixation of a fair rent for each of the premises.
The fair rent claimed was computed at Rs239903 per month in respect of item No 1 as against the rent of Rs 150 pm fixed under the lease deed.
The defendants GG and his sons filed their objections to the above applications.
In view of this the Rent Controller dismissed HRC 3310 65 relating to item No 1 and in HRC 331165 fixed the fair rent in respect of item No 2 at Rs 1451 pm.
In respect of item No 1 in HRA 53466 the Court on a perusal of the sale deed dated 30753 filed by the LIC before it came to the conclusion that the buildings on the land leased under exhibit P 1 had also been conveyed to the LIC and that the LIC was entitled to seek fixation of fair rent in respect of this premises also.
The fair rent fixed by the Rent Controller at Rs994 pm was upheld.
It may be mentioned here that even in certain earlier proceedings for fixation of fair rent and eviction HRC 86773 and HRC 255764 it had been held by the Rent Controller that item No 1 door No 2 belonged to the LIC but his order of eviction had been set aside by the appellate court on some other ground.
The suit was decreed accordingly.
OSA 62 of 1973 was therefore allowed to that extent.
