These appeals arise out of an election to a seat in the West Bengal Legislative Assembly from the Khargram Murshidabad constitutency reserved for members of the Scheduled Castes.
The contestants at this election were Abhoy Pada Saha and Sudhir Kumar Mondal.
Sudhir is admittedly a member of a Scheduled Caste.
Abhoy Pada described himself in the nomination paper as a member of the Sunri caste which is a Scheduled Caste.
The objection was rejected by the Returning Officer.
We shall first deal with Appeal No 931 of 1965 filed by Abhoy Pada and shall hereafter refer to him as the appellant and Sudhir as the respondent.
Appeal No 931 of 1965 allowed.
Appeal No 1149 of 1965 dismissed.
