Appeal No 251 of 1963.
Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated March 20 1957 of the Patna High Court in Civil Revision No 40 of 1956.
M C Setalvad and R C Prasad for the appellants.
The respondent did not appear.
March 24 1964.
The short question which arises in this appeal is whether the term wages as defined by section 2vi of the No 4 of 1936 hereinafter called the Act  includes wages fixed by an award in an industrial dispute between the employer and his employees.
This question has to be answered in the light of the definition prescribed by section 2vi before it was amended in 1958.
The subsequent amendment expressly provides by section 2vi a that any remuneration payable under any award or settlement between the parties or order of a Court would be included in the main definition under section 2vi.
It is common ground that between the appellant Sasamusa Sugar Works Ltd and its workmen the respondents an award had been made by an Industrial Tribunal fixing the pay of the employees at Rs 22 per day and in pursuance of the said award the management of the appellant had entered into an agreement with the respondents that effect would be given to the wage structure prescribed by the said award.
This agreement was subsequently published in the Bihar Gazette as a part of the award.
