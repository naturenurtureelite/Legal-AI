The following Judgments of the Court were delivered CHINNAPPA REDDY J We grant special leave and proceed to dispose of the appeal.
A hundred and thirty two years ago in 1854 the wise Indian Chief of Seattle  replied to the offer of the great White Chief in Washington  to buy their land.
The reply is profound It is beautiful.
It is timeless.
It contains the wisdom of the ages.
It is the first ever and the most under standing statement on environment.
It is worth quoting.
To abridge it or to quote extracts from it is to destroy its beauty.
You cannot scratch a painting and not diminish its beauty.
We will quote the whole of it  How can you buy or sell the sky the warmth of the land The idea is strange to us.
If we do not own the freshness of the air and the sparkle of the water how can you buy them Every part of the earth is sacred to my people.
Every shining pine needle every sandy shore every mist in the dark woods every clearing and humming insect is holy in the memory and experience of my people.
I No 1 June 1984.
The rockly crests the juices in the meadows the body heat of the pony and man all belong to the same family So when the Great Chief in Washing ton sends word that he wishes to buy our land he asks much of us.
So we will consider your offer to buy our land.
For this land is sacred to us This shining water moves in the streams and rivers is not just water but the blood of our ancestors.
I agree.
