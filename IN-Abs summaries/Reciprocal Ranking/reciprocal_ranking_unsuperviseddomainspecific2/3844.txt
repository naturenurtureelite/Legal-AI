Appeal No 182 828 of 1975.
Appeal by Special Leave from the Judgment and Order dated the 19th March 1975 of the Bombay High Court in First Appeal No 524 of 1966 from original decree.
R B Datar for the Appellant.
V N Ganpule and Mrs V D Khanna for the respondent.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRACHUD CJ.
It will be easier with the help of the following pedigree to understand the point involved in this appeal Khandappa Sangappa Magdum Hirabai Plaintiff Gurupad Biyawwa Bhagirathibai Dhundubai Shivapad Deft 1 Deft 3 Deft.
41 Deft 5 Deft 2 Khandappa died on June 27 1960 leaving him surviving his wife Hirabai who is the plaintiff two sons Gurupad and Shivapad who are defendants 1 and 2 respectively and three daughters defendants 3 to 5.
On November 6  1962 Hirabai filed special civil suit No 26 of 1963 in the court of the Joint Civil Judge Senior Division Sangli for partition and separate possession of a 724th share in two houses a land two shops avoid movables on the basis that these properties belonged to the joint family consisting of her husband herself and their two sons.
If a partition were to take place during Khandappa s lifetime between himself and his two sons the plaintiff would have got 14th share in the joint family properties the other three getting 14th share each.
Khandappa s 14th share would devolve upon his death on six sharers the plaintiff and her five children each having a 124th share therein.
Adding 14th and 124th the plaintiff claims a 724th share in the joint family properties.
That in short is the plaintiffs case.
Defendants 2 to 5 admitted the plaintiff s claim the suit having H been contested by defendant 1 Gurupad only.
He contended that the suit properties did not belong to the joint family that they were Khandappa s self requisitions and that on the date of Khandappa s 764 death in 1960 there was no joint family in existence.
He alleged that Khandappa had effected a partition of the suit properties between himself and his two sons in December 1952 and December 1954 and that by a family arrangement dated March 31 1955 he bad given directions for disposal of the share which was reserved by him for himself in the earlier partitions.
There was therefore no question of a fresh partition.
That in short is the case of defendant 1.
The trial court by its judgment dated July 13 1965 rejected defendant 1 s case that the properties were Khandappa s self acquisitions and that he had partitioned them during his lifetime.
Upon that finding the plaintiff.
became indisputably entitled to a share in the joint family properties but following the judgment of the Bombay High Court in Shiramabai Bhimgonda vs Kalgonda1 the learned trial judge limited that share to 124th refusing to add 14th and 124th together.
As against that decree defendant 1 filed first appeal No 524 of 1966 in the Bombay High Court while the plaintiff filed cross objections.
By a judgment dated March 19 1975 a Division Bench of the High Court dismissed defendant 1 s appeal and allowed the plaintiff s cross objections by holding that the suit properties belonged to the joint family that there was no prior partition and that the plaintiff is entitled to a 724th share.
Defendant I has filed this appeal against the High Court s judgment by special leave.
Another Division Bench of the Bombay High Court in Rangubai Lalji vs Laxman Lalji2 had already reconsidered and dissented from earlier Division Bench judgment in Shiramabai Bhimgonda1 In these two cases the judgment of the Bench was delivered by the same learned Judge Patel J.
Explanation 2.
The interpretation which we are placing upon the provisions of section 6 its proviso and explanation I thereto will further the legislative intent in regard to the enlargement of the share of female heirs qualitatively and quantitatively.
