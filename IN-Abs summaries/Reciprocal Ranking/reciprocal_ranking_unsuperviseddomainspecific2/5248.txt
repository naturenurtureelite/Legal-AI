The asses see Dr RS Gupta had maintained an account in the books of Messrs Tika Ram and Sons Pvt.
On 1st January 1957 the account showed a credit of Rs 150740.
On that day the assessee had addressed a letter to the Company stating that he had decided to gift away for love and affection various sums to the following persons 125 Ved Prakash Gupta .
Rs25000 Om Prakash Gupta .
Rs25000 Hari Prakash Gupta .
Rs50000 Pravin Kumar Gupta .
Rs 50000 By that letter the assessee had directed the Company to debit his account to the extent of Rs 150000 and credit the respective amounts in the names of the aforesaid per sons.
It appears further that copies of this letter were sent to one Om Prakash Gupta and Ved Prakash Gupta.
There was no dispute that instructions of the assessee were car ried out by the Company and relevant debit and credit en tries were made in the respective accounts.
On the same day ie on ist January 1957 Om Parkash Gupta wrote to the assessee his father thanking him for the gift of Rs25000 made in his favour and the gift of Rs50000 in favour of his son Pravin.
It must be mentioned however that the company ie Messrs Tika Ram and Sons.
contractors and brick kiln owners.
The assessee contended that a total sum of Rs 150000 was validly gifted by him to his sons and grand sons and hence the amounts had been wrongly included in his net wealth by the Income Tax Officer and the Appellate Assistant Commissioner.
It is possible in certain circumstances for a donor to make a valid gift by instructing a firm or a company or a HUF in which the donor has an account to give effect to the gift by debiting his account and crediting the account in the name of the donee.
NPV Appeal allowed.
