The Judgment of Court was delivered by AHMADI J Special leave granted.
The appellants are the legal representatives of the deceased plaintiff Inacio Martins who died pendente lite.
He had on October 26 1968 instituted a suit No 157 of 1968 for a declaration and an injunction to restrain the defendants from dispossessing him from the property known as Palmar Oiteral do Predio Aivao  comprising seven lots of coconut grove situated at Caranzalem belonging to defendant No 2.
On the dismissal of the said suit the original plaintiff filed another suit No 11474 on May 6 1974 for restoration of possession on the ground that he was the lawful tenant of the said property and since he had not been dispossessedin accordance with law the defen dants who were mere trespassers were liable to be evicted.
The plaintiffs case in the plaint was that he was the lessee in respect of seven lots on an annual rent of Rs 3600 payable in advance in three instalments that he had paid the rent upto the end of December 1967 and the first installment of 1968 but the owner defendant No 2 in collusion with defendant No 1 executed a deed of lease in favour of the latter effective from January 1 1968 on the strength whereof defendant No 1 claimed to have assumed possession of the property sometime in the second week of June 1968 without his tenancy having been lawfully terminated.
The plaintiff therefore contended that defendant No 1 was a trespasser in the property and was liable to be evicted therefrom.
The Trial Court therefore held that the plaintiff was wrongly dispossessed by defendant No 1 in collusion with defendant No2 and decreed the suit for eviction on September 25 1985.
