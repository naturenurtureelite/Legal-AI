Criminal Appeal No 400 of 1979.
From the Judgment and Order dated 27479 of the Madras High Court in Criminal Misc.
P No 265 of 1978.
216 Kapil Sibal BRL Iyengar KV Mohan SR Setia KR Nambiar and AK Nigam for the Appellant.
AD Giri Solicitor General KTS Tulsi Additional Solicitor General AM Khanwilkar and P Parmeswaran for the Respondent.
I have had the advantage of deciphering the two draft judgments prepared by my learned brothers Shetty and Verma JJ.
I agree with the conclusions arrived at by my learned brother Shetty J Yet considering the great impor tance of the questions involved in this matter I deem it just and proper to consider the same and to express my own views.
Three very important questions fall for decision in this case.
First of all whether a Judge of the Supreme Court or a Judge of a High Court is a public servant within the meaning of Section 2 of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1947.
Section 2 of the Prevention of Corruption Act interprets a public servant as meaning a public servant as defined in section 21 of the Indian Penal Code ie Act 45 of 1860.
It has many dimensions.
I agree with the conclusion of my learned brother Shetty J.
But Counsel for the appellant has reservations.
Interpretation.
