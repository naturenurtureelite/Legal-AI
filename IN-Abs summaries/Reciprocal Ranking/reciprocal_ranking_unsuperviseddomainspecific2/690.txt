The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR J.
These two appeals by special leave raise a common question of law and that is whether business losses incurred in the erstwhile State of Cochin could under the Income tax Act of Travancore be set off against the business profits made in the erstwhile State of Travancore.
In Appeal No 260 58 a further question arose whether in the case of 259 that assessee the year ending June 30 1949 was the previous year for the assessment year 1950 51 with the result that it should be assessed under the Indian Income tax Act of 1922.
But this question was not answered by the High Court which confined itself to answering the first question which was common to both the appeals.
The appellant before us in both the appeals is the Commissioner of Income tax and the respondents are the two assessees in one case a Bank and the other a private limited company.
The main argument has been confined to the question of applicability of section 321 and the first proviso to that section of the Travancore Income tax Act hereinafter called the Travancore Act.
It filed its incometax return showing an income of Rs 11872 for the assessment year 1948 49 its accounting year being the previous calendar year.
The Income tax Officer determined its assessable income to be Rs 90947 representing only the profit it made in Travancore State and under section 321 proviso 1 of the Travancore Act he refused a deduction of Rs 79275 shown as loss from branches situate outside the State of Travancore in British India and other Indian States.
At the instance of the Commissioner of Income tax the following question was referred to the High Court of Travancore Cochin Is the aforesaid sum of Rs 79275 a loss of the assessee arising outside the Travancore State for purpose of the first proviso to section 321 of the Travancore Income tax Act   This question was slightly modified by the High Court 260 which after referring to several decided cases answered the question in favour of the assessee.
It was carrying on business at its head office in Cochin State and it also carried on business in Travancore State.
The assesse made a profit in Travancore State and incurred a loss in the State of Cochin and sought to deduct this loss from the profit of Travancore State thus showing a net profit of Rs 2643.
On an application of the assessee the following question was referred to the High Court of Travancore Cochin  Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the loss of Rs 27709 arising in Cochin State could be set off against the profit of Rs 38998 arising in Travancore State   and was answered in favour of the assessee.
The Commissioner has come up in appeal pursuant to special leave against both these judgments.
Indian Act.
