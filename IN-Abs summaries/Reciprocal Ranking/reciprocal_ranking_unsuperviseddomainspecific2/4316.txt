The following Judgements were delivered PATHAK J.
This appeal by special leave has been preferred by Tata Consultancy Engineers against an award dated 20th December 1978 of the Industrial Tribunal Maharashtra Bombay revising the wage scales of certain categories of employees and granting various other benefits.
Tata Consultant Engineers at its inception was a partnership firm but subsequently the partnership was dissolved and in 1974 the undertaking became one of the divisions of Tata Sons Limited.
It functions as a consulting organisation and a service industry and does not manufacture any product or carry on trade.
Its work force consists of engineers and supervisors and different categories of workmen.
Out of 665 employees at Bombay the draftsmen and the administrative staff number 306.
These workmen are members of the Tata Consultant Employees Union.
They served a Charter of Demands in July 1974 on the appellant and as their demands were not accepted and conciliation proceedings proved fruitless the State Government made a reference of the dispute under section 101 d Industrial Tribunal Maharashtra for adjudication.
The Reference was numbered I T No 292 of 1975.
170 The Union filed a statement before the Tribunal claiming an upward revision of the wage scales and dearness allowance and an increase from fifteen years to twenty years in the span for earning annual increments.
It was urged that the Efficiency Bar as a feature of the wage scales should be removed.
The dearness allowance it was claimed should be granted on a slab system.
The claim of the Union was resisted by the appellant who maintained that the existing wage scales were fair and reasonable on a region cum industry basis and that it would not be possible for the appellant to bear the additional financial burden if the demands of the Union were accepted.
Reference was made to the political uncertainty in Iran which had placed an appreciable part of the appellant s business in jeopardy and to various other factors peculiar to an engineering consultancy business beyond the appellant s control.
There was fierce competition also it was asserted from other similar organisations.
The appellant had introduced various pay scales in 1973 and some time later they were revised.
There was no separate dearness allowance until January 1977 when it was introduced for the first time.
House rent allowance was also paid.
Dearness allowance became payable at 10 of the basic wage subject to a minimum of Rs 50 and house rent allowance at 30 of the basic salary.
Having regard to the net profits earned by the appellant from 1968 to 1977 it found that the acceptance of the demands of the Union would result in an increased burden of Rs 7 crores a burden which would dry up the appellant s resources and would be impossible for it to bear.
The Union modified its demands but even the modified terms according to the Tribunal appeared to be on the high side inasmuch as the resulting total burden of Rs 170 crores was much higher than the average profits could sustain.
Revising the figures on that basis it computed the annual gross profits for the years 1968 to 1977 and determined the annual average at Rs 2669 lakhs.
 It also observed that the category of Draughtsmen needed a special increase.
Taking all these factors into consideration it made an award dated 20th December 1978 prescribing the following revision in the existing scales of wages Grade  Category Existing Grade Revised Grade Scale Scale I PeonHelper Rs 250 10 300 EB Rs 350 10 450 15 Sweeper 10 400.
III Jr Clerk cum Rs 350 15 425 EB Rs 450 20 550 25 TypistJr.

VI DraughtsmanSite Rs 380 30 620 40 Rs 530 40 730 50 Supervisor 1020 EB 50 1320.
 Further it appears that the Tribunal intended to grant the increase of Rs 150 to each draughtsman and Rs 100 to all other workmen in their basic pay.
The same has been made clear in paragraph No 23 but it appears that the words to each employee after the figure Rs 150  were omitted.
When the award is sent for publication a necessary corrigendum be made in the award and the aforesaid words after the figures Rs 150 and Rs 100 be added.
Further it appears that the Tribunal intended to grant the increase of Rs 150 to each draughtsman and Rs 100 to all other workmen in their basic pay.
