The assessee firm then applied to the Tribunal to refer the following question to the High Court of Madras Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the disallowance of the bad debt of Rs 268385 is right in law  The Tribunal rejected the application but pursuant to an order made by the High Court of Madras under section 662 submitted a statement of the case on the following question Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the Tribunal was right in law in holding that the debt of Rs 268385 was not one incurred in the course of money lending business of the assessee  In the opinion of the High Court the debt of Rs 268385 due to the appellants was not a bad and doubtful debt in its money lending business not a debt representing loss sustained in the other business.
Section 102 xi of the Indian Income tax Act 1922 as in force at the relevant time provided  2 Such profits or gains shall be computed after making the following allowances namely  xi When the assessee s accounts in respect of any part of his business profession or vocation are not kept on the cash basis such sum in respect of bad and doubtful debts due to the assessee in 807SupCI71 418 respect of that part of his business profession or vocation and in the case of an assessee carrying on a banking or money lending business such sum in respect of loans made in the ordinary course of such business as the Income tax Officer may estimate to be irrecoverable but not exceeding the amount actually written off as irrecoverable in the books of the assessee Provided      Clause xi was in two parts.
A bad and doubtful debt due to the taxpayer written off as irrecoverable in the books of account was properly allowable in computing the taxable profits from business profession or vocation where accounts were not kept on the cash basis if the debt was in respect of a loan made in the course of the taxpayer s business as a banker or money lender or when the taxpayer was carrying on any other business the debt was in respect of that other business.
A bad and doubtful debt in respect of a business other than banking or money lending is allowable even if it is not in respect of loan  but a debt due in the course of the business of a money lending is not allowable unless it is in respect of loans made in the ordinary course of his business.
In the interest of justice we direct that the question be reframed as follows  Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the Tribunal erred in disallowing the debt of Rs 268385 written off by the assessee in their books of account as irrecoverable.
In the assessment of income tax of the appellant for the assessment year 1952 53 relevant to the account year Samvat 2008 the assessee claimed a deduction of Rs 268385 as bad debt due from the Bombay firm incurred by that firm in the course of business transactions.
In appeal the Appellate Assistant Commissioner agreed with the Income tax Officer.
The tribunal rejected that application but pursuant to an order of the High Court under section 662 the tribunal submitted a statement of the case on the following question Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the Tribunal was right in law in holding that the debt of Rs 268385 was not one incurred in the course of money lending business of the assessee The High Court opined that the debt in question was not a bad and doubtful debt in the assessee s money lending business nor a debt representing loss sustained in the other business.
It accordingly .
reframed the question as follows Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the Appellate Tribunal erred in disallowing a sum of Rs 268385 written off by the assessee in their books of accounts as irrecoverable  By its order dated July 29 1969 this Court called upon the Tribunal to submit a supplementary statement of case on the reframed question.
The tribunal has accordingly submitted a further statement.
On the other hand the narrations in the entries as they stand the failure to adjust interest in the account of the Bombay firm at the stage at which it became a debtor in Samvat year 2007 the manner in which the partner of the appellant firm tried to explain the position in March 1954 and the stand of the firm itself at all earlier stages support the case of the Department 12.
Having considered all the circumstances of the case we are of the opinion that the sums in question were not sent to the Bombay firm as loans made in the ordinary course of the money lending business of the assessee nor in respect of any other business of the assessee.
It is also true that the tribunal after catalogueing the arguments advanced at the bar has come to certain abrupt conclusions but all the tame it cannot be denied that the findings reached by the tribunal are findings of fact and those findings are supported by the evidence on record.
No costs.
