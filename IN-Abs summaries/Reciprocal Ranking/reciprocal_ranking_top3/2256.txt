The learned Judge held that at the time when the appeal of the defendant was disposed of by the Subordinate Judge the rights of the parties were governed by the Thika Tenancy Act of 1949 and the definition of a thika tenant in that Act was not such as to afford any protection to the appellant.

It is however clear that the benefit of section 28 was available only if the decree or order for the recovery of possession had been made before the date of the commencement of the Act but 176 possession of such holding had not been recovered from him.
By section 2 of this Ordinance the definition of thika tenant in the Calcutta Thika Tenancy Act 1949 was substituted by a new one namely 5 thika tenant  means any person who holds whether under a written lease or otherwise land under another person and is but for a special contract would be liable to pay rent at a monthly or at any other periodical rate for that land to that another person and has erected any structure on such land for a residential manufacturing or business purpose and includes the successor in interest of such person but does not include a person a who holds such land under that another person in perpetuity or b who holds such land under that another person under a registered lease in which the duration of the lease is expressly stated to be for a period of not less than twelve years or c who holds such land under that another person and uses or occupies such land as a khattal.

Before the Act had come into force the landlord could not possibly know that his suit would be liable to be defeated unless he applied to the controller because there was no such authority functioning then.
