This interpretation is in accord with what was decided by this Court in Prakash Chand Mehra s case1 and that decision in our opinion would govern the interpretation of para.
292 of the Sastry award as modified by the Labour Appellate decision.
Point to point adjustment as on January 1 1959 would give him Rs 106 in the Sastry award scale as modified.
iv his salary has to be fixed as on January 1 1959 at Rs 106.
He would not be entitled to any increments under sub cls.
b and c because his actual salary coincided with the adjusted basic pay in the Sastry award scale as modified as on January 1 1959.
d for the years 1960 and 1961 and his salary therefore as on January 1 1962 under the Sastry award would come to Rs 119.
The bank actually fixed him at Rs 176 on its own interpretation of the award.
His salary as on January 1 1959 was Rs 100 and his place of posting was Nakodar in area IV of the 1 906 Sastry award.
Under subcl.

The thirteenth stage in the Desai award scale is Rs 182 for that area.
In addition he is entitled to two increments on account of being a graduate and one increment on account of his having passed the Indian Institute of Bankers  examination.
His actual salary in the Desai scale on January 1 1962 will be Rs 182 plus Rs 33 ie Rs 215.
