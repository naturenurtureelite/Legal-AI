Sub section 4 of section 14 of the Amending Act provides that persons employed by a Panchayat Samiti before April 1 1973 and who were in service at the commencement of the Amending Act shall continue to service on the same terms and conditions on which they were employed by the Panchayat Samiti until they are absorbed in the Government service or retire in such manner as may be prescribed.
Being aggrieved by his absorption on a lower post he filed a writ petition in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana asking that he should be absorbed as a Head Clerk.
But as a result of the deletion of section 33 of the Act by the Amending Act of 1973 the Panchayat Samiti lost its power to make appointments to the Panchayat.
the Panchayat.
737 It is urged by Shri Jain who appears on behalf of the appellant that by reason of section 144 of the Amending Act the appellant was entitled to continue in the service of the Panchayat on the same terms and conditions on which he was employed by the Panchayat Samiti until he was absorbed in Government service.
Even assuming for the purposes of argument that the right to be considered for promotion is a term and condition of service what is relevant for our purpose is not whether the appellant was entitled to be considered for promotion but whether the Panchayat Samiti had the right to appoint him to the post of Head Clerk on the date on which it purported to do so.
SR Appeal dismissed.
