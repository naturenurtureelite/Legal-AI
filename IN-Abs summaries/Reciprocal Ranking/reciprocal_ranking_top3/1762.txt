March 12 1964.
Thereupon there was a reference to a Full Bench on the question of liability which was formulated by the learned Judges thus Whether the expression Government of the corresponding State  used in article 2952 of the Constitution with reference to Rajasthan properly means the Government of the United State of Rajasthan which was the only Indian State in existence at the time of the commencement of the Constitution or it also includes the Government of any of the Covenanting States which had integrated with the United State before the Constitution came into operation.
The three second appeals were dismissed by the High Court.
Now we find from the history we have already narrated above that every time there was a merger and formation of a new State the old laws were always to continue till they were repealed amended or altered by the new State.
This is the basic difference between the Dalmia Dadri Cement Company case1 and the present case for in that case the old laws were repealed and thus repudiated in areas other than Patiala State while in the present case the old laws were continued till they were repealed or altered and in view of that basic difference between that case and the present case we can legitimately call in aid article VI of the Covenant and similar provisions which were always made throughout this process of merger in Rajasthan and treat them as evidence from which to come to the conclusion that the new State by continuing the old laws without change till they were repealed or altered recognised that it was liable in the same way as would have been the merging State if there was any liability on the merging State.
