The High Court has affirmed the finding of the authority and held that section 15 was applicable to the case because the wages prescribed by the award did amount to wages as defined by section 2vi of the Act.
In dealing with the question of construing the unamended definition of the term wages it is essential to bear in mind the scope and character of the powers conferred on Industrial Tribunals when they deal with industrial disputes under the provisions of the Indus trial Disputes Act.
When an award is made and it prescribes a new wage structure in law the old contractual wage structure becomes inoperative and its place is taken by the wage structure prescribed by the award.
In this connectionwe may incidentally refer to the decision of this Court in the South Indian Bank Ltd vs A R Chacko1 where it has been observed by this Court that the very purpose for which industrial adjudication has been given the peculiar authority and right of making new contracts between employers and workmen makes it reasonable to think that even though the period of operation of the award and the period for which it remains binding on the parties may elapse in respect of both of which special provisions have been made under sections 23 and 29 respectively the new contract would continue to govern the relations between the parties till it is replaced by another contract.
Appeal dismissed 1 AIR 1951 Cal 29.
