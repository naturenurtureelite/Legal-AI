Civil Appeal No 1709 of 1988.
There will be no order as to costs.
Jurisdiction powers and authority of t he Central Administrative Tribunal 27 1 Save as otherwise expressly provided in th is Act the Central Administrative Tribunal shall exercise on and from the appointed day all the jurisdiction powers a nd authority exercisable immediately before that day by a ll courts except Supreme Court in relation to a recruitment and matters concerning recrui t ment to any All India Service or to any civil service of the Union or a civil post under the Union or to a po st connected with defence or in the defence services being in either case a post filled by a civilian b all service matters concerning Similar are the powers and authority of the State Ser v ice Tribunal under sec.
Section 27 provides for finality of t he orders of the Tribunal.
Mr Mah a jan learned counsel for the Central Government urged th at the Tribunal has no powers to interfere with the punishme nt imposed by the disciplinary authority on the ground that it is disproportionate to the proved misdemeanour.
He al so urged that if the enquiry held against the delinquent off i cer was proper with the findings supported by evidence the n the Tribunal cannot substitute its own judgment to modi fy the punishment awarded.
If the High Court is satisfied that if some but not all of t he findings of the Tribunal were unreasonable the order of the Governor on whose powers by the rules no restrictions in determining the appropriate punishment are placed w as final and the High Court had no jursidiction to direct t he Governor to review the penalty for as we have alrea dy observed the order of dismissal passed by a competent a u thority on a public servant if the conditions of the co n stitutional protection have been complied with is n ot justifiable.
The principle that if some of the reasons relied on by a Tribunal for its conclusion tu rn out to be extraneous or otherwise unsustainable its dec i sion would be vitiated applies to cases in which the co n clusion is arived at not on assessment of objective sati s faction.
 The learned Judge also said at 227 Now it is settled by the decision of this Court in State of Orissa vs Bidyabhushan Mohapatra that if the ord er of a punishing authority can be supported on any finding as to substantial misdemeanour for which the punishment can be imposed it is not for the Court to consider whether the 33 charge proved alone would have weighed with the authority in imposing the punishment.
This power has been conceded to the cou rt in Union of India vs Tulsiram Patel  whe re Madon J observed at 501 502 Where a disciplinary authority comes to know th at a government servant has been convicted on a crimin al charge it must consider whether his conduct which has l ed to his conviction was such as warrants the imposition of a penalty and if so what that penalty should be   35 The disciplinary authority must however bear in mind th at a conviction on a criminal charge does not automatical ly entail dismissal removed or reduction in rank of the co n cerned government servant.
