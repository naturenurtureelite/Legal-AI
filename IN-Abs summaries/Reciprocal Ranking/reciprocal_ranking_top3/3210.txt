Before the High Court the contention of the Federation was that the premises in which the registered office of the Federation is located is not a commercial establishment within the meaning of section 25 of the Act which in consequence had no application.
 352 It was then contended that the activities of the Federation carried on in the premises in question amounted to work in connection with or incidental or ancillary to trade or business in general within the latter part of the definition of commercial establishment.
They read Commercial establishment means any premises wherein any trade business or profession or any work in connection with or incidental or ancillary thereto is carried on and includes a society registered under the  and charitable or other trust whether registered or not which carries on any business trade or profession or work in connection with or incidental or ancillary thereto  journalistic and printing establishments quarries and mines not governed by the  educational or other Institutions run for private gain and premises in which business of banking insurance stocks and shares brokerage or produce exchange is carried on but does not include a shop or a factory registered under the  or theaters cinemas restaurants eating houses residential hotels clubs or other places of public amusement or entertainment.
  Shop means any premises where goods are sold either by retail or wholesale Or where services are rendered to customers and includes an office a stoic room godown warehouse or workhouse or work place whether in the same premises or otherwise used in or in connection with such trade or business but does not include a factory or commercial establishment.
It came up for consideration before this Court in Management of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry vs Their workman Shri R K Mittal1 After considering its Memorandum of Association Articles of Association and other material which was more or less the same as in the present case it was held by this Court that the activity of this Federation is in the nature of a business or trade.
 Mr Pai further maintains that the ratio in R K Mittal s case supra is not applicable to the instant case because the definition of  industry in section 2j of the is far wider than that of commercial establishment in section 25 of the Act.
That definition reads  Industry means any business trade undertaking manufacture or calling of employers and includes any calling service employment handicraft or industrial occupa tion or evocation of workmen.
VPS Appeal allowed.
