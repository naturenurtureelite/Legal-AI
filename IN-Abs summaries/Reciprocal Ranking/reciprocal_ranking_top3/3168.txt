The Full Bench speaking through Jaganmohan Reddy CJ as our learned brother then was held that if no balance sheet is laid before a general body there can be no question of that balance sheet not being adopted nor of complying with the requirements of section 220 and though wilful omission to call a general body meeting and to lay the balance sheet and profit and loss account before it may expose the person responsible to punishment under other provisions of the Act it certainly does not make him liable under the provisions of section 1344 of the Companies Act 1913 or section 220 of the .
If no balance sheet is laid before a general body there can be no question of that balance sheet not being adopted nor of complying with the requirements of the Sub section 2 of Section 134 of the Old Companies Act or Section 220 of the Act as the case may be while wilful omission to call a general body meeting and omit to lay the balance sheet and profit and loss account before it may expose the person responsible to punishment under other provisions of the Act it certainly does not make him liable udder aforesaid provisions.
But section 134 lays down that after balance sheet and profit and loss account or the income and expenditure account as the case may be have been laid before the company at the general meeting three copies thereof shall be filed with the registrar and a failure to do so is made punishable under sub section 4 of that section.
It is possible to conceive of the law providing that the balance sheet and profit and loss account shall be sent to the registrar even without the necessity of their being laid before the general body meeting of the company.
