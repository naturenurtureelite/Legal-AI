The proviso to clause a was Provided that a dealer registered under this Act shall also be entitled to purchase barley without payment of sales tax on the authority of his certificate of registra tion on furnishing to the selling registered dealer a declaration referred to above for sale by him in the course of export outside the territory of India within the meaning of section 5 of the  and that to clause b read Provided that a dealer registered under this Act shall also be entitled to purchase without payment of sales tax on the authority of his certificate of registration goods mentioned in clause b above on furnishing to the selling registered dealer a declaration referred to above for use by him in the manufacture in the State of scientific goods and guar gum for the purpose of sale by him in the course of export outside the territory of India within the meaning of sub section 3 of section 5 of the  It also inserted with retrospective effect from 1476 the following sub section 2 Notwithstanding anything contained in form ST 15 or the certificate of registration issued under this Act or the Rules made thereunder no dealer shall be entitled to claim the right envisaged in sub section 1 so renumbered for the period from the first day of April 1976 to the third day of September 1979 in contravention of the provisions of sub section 1 so renumbered The Act also contained a section section 8 validating the notification issued under section 9 read with section 15 and also validating all levy assessment and collection of taxes under section 9 notwithstanding any judgment decree or order of any court or other authority.
However it added a new sub section 3 with retrospective effect from 275.
When is a sale or purchase of goods said to take place in the course of import or export 1 A sale or purchase of goods shah be deemed to take place in the course of the export of the goods out of the territory of India only if the sale or purchase either occasions such export or is effected by a transfer of documents of title to the goods after the goods have crossed the customs frontiers of India.
As pointed out by Sri Agarwal even in Mohd Sirajuddin s case supra although the exemption claimed for the sales as export sales was denied the conclusion of the High Court that the sales to STC were inter State sales chargeable under section 51 of the CST Act was upheld.
There is however nothing unconstitutional about the two other consequences that flow on the language of the clause one express and the other implied one in favour of the Revenue and the other in favour of the assessee viz 364 1 that there will be a tax on the purchase of the raw materials if the manufactured goods are disposed of in the State itself otherwise than by way of sale and 2 that there will be no tax on the purchase of the raw materials if the manufactured goods are despatched from the State consequent on a i local sale ii inter State sale or iii a sale in the course of export.
This definition includes within the definition of turnover  the purchase value of goods liable to tax under section 9 but the goods presently in question are not laible to tax under section 9 not only as contended for the assessees and held by us above but also on the hypothesis as to the invalidity of section 91b on which the present argument on behalf of the Revenue pro ceeds.
