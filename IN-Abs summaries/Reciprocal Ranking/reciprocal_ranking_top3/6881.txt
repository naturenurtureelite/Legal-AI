B Baijnath Singh  wherein the vires of a provision of the Rewa State Pre emption Act which conferred a right of pre emption based on vicinage and the right of preemption conferred on co sharers and the Punjab Pre emption Act 1913 were challenged on the ground of infraction of Article 191 f of the Constitu tion.
Accord ing to section 15 of this Act before its amendment in1960 in the case of sale of a share out of joint land or proper ty the right of preemption was conferred firstly on the lineal descendents of the vendor in order of succession secondly in the co sharers if any who are agnates in order of succession thirdly in persons not included under firstly or secondly above in order of succession who but for such sale would be entitled on death of the vendor to inherit the land or property sold and fourthly in the co sharers.
Section 15 after its amendment in 1960 provided that where the sale is of a share out of the joint land or property and is not by all the co sharers jointly the right of pre emption was vested first in the sons or daughters or son s son or daughter s sons of the vendor or vendors Secondly in the brothers or brother s sons of the vendor or vendors Thirdly in the father s brother or father s broth er s sons of the vendor or vendors Fourthly in the other co sharers and Fifthly n the tenants.
We therefore do not approve the ratio of Jagdish s case and overrule the same.
