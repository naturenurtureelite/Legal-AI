Stage carriage is defined by section 229 as a motor vehicle carrying or adapted to carry more than six persons excluding the driver which carries passengers for hire or reward at separate fares paid by or for individual passengers either for the whole journey or for stages of the journey Chapter IV sections 42 to 68 deals with Control of Transport vehicles.
It is as follows 7 Notwithstanding anything contained in sub section1 but subject to any rules that may be made under this Act any State Transport Authority may for the purpose of promoting tourism grant permits valid for the whole or any part of India in respect of such number of tourist vehicles as the Central Government may in respect of that State specify in this behalf and the provisions of Sections 49 50 51 57 58 59 59 A 60 61 and 64 shall as far as may be apply in relation to such permits Provided that preference shall be given to applications for permits from i the India Tourism Development Corporation ii a State Tourism Development Corporation iii a State Tourist Department iv such operators of tourist cars or such travel agents as may be approved in this behalf by the Ministry of the Central Government dealing in tourism.
Section 68 F1 prescribes that where in pursuance of an approved scheme a State Transport Undertaking applies for a stage carriage permit a contract carriage permit or a public carrier s permit in respect of a notified area or notified route such permit shall be granted to the State Transport Undertaking by the State Transport Authority in a case where the said area or route lies in more than one region and the Regional Transport Authority in any other case.
When the Undertaking applies for permit under Chapter IV it must satisfy the Regional Transport Authority that it is better suited than the private operator to render transport facility to the travelling public.
In an application under Chapter IV Corporation has to enter the arena like any other applicant face the competition and come up to the level of other private operators intending to obtain stage carriage permits and then in respect of the route in question claim preference.
The reference to Chapter IV A there was for the purpose of contrasting the exclusion contemplated by section 68F1 with the preference to be given under section 47 1 H and so to interpret the word preference  occurring in section 471 H.
Since the State Transport Appellate Tribunal and the High Court have failed to consider the merits of the claims of the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation and the private operators who did not get a certificate of approval from the Central Government because of the rule of preference contained in proviso to section 637 the proper course for us is to set aside the orders of the State Transport Appellate Tribunal and the High Court and to direct the State Transport Appellate Tribunal to re hear the appeals and dispose them of in accordance with law after considering the claims of the eligible applicants in the manner indicated in Sher Singh s case and now.
Clauses i to iii of the proviso providing for preference to be given to applications for permits from the Indian Tourism Development Corporation the State Tourism Development Corporation and the State Tourist Department were not questioned but the preference provided for by clause iv and to be given to such operators of tourist cars or such travel agents as may be approved in this behalf by the Ministry dealing in tourism was questioned as an infringement of article 14 of the Constitution.
