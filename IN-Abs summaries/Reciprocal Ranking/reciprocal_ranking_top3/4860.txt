Now proceed to record our reasons.
The last charge No 4 framed against accused 1 6 and 7 was under section 302 read with section 34 IPC on the allegation that in pursuance of the conspiracy and in furtherance of their common intention they committed the murder of Malan on or about 111976.
As state earlier Criminal Appeal 38 of 783 of 1977 was filed by the State for enhancement of the sentence of imprisonment for life awarded to accused 1 and 6 in respect of the murder of Malan and Criminal Appeal 605 of 1978 against the acquittal of accused 2 3 4 5 and 7 of charge No 1 framed under section 302 read with section 120B IPC Thus the acquittal of accused 1 and 6 of charge No 1 framed against them under section 302 read with section 120B IPC and of accused 1 to 3 of charge No 2 in respect of the murder of Ashamati and of accused 1 to 4 of charge No 3 in respect of the murder of Parubai became final.
The High Court considered the evidence and dismissed Criminal Appeal 38 of 1977 filed by the State for enhancement of the sentence of imprisonment for life awarded to accused 1 and 6 for the murder of Malan as also Criminal Appeal 7 of 1977 filed by accused 1 and 6 against their conviction and the sentence awarded to them.
We were therefore not called upon to consider any such question.
