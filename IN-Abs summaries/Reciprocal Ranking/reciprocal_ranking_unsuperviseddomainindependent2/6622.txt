 These amendments were effective from 141976.
The State Government had issued a notification dated 19774 even before the 1976 amendment clarifying the position with an answer to the question in the affirmative but this notification as well as the interpretation favoured by it were quashed by a decision of the High Court reported as Goodyear India Ltd vs State 1982 53 STC 163.
The exclusion of milk was decided to be dropped and so all that this amendment did was to roll both clauses b and bb into one clause reading thus 4.

It also omitted the proviso to the said clause.
