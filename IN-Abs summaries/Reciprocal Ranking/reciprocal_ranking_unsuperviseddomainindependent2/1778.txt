M C Setalvad and R C Prasad for the appellants.
The respondent did not appear.
March 24 1964.
In spite of the award and the agreement the appellant paid its employees only As.
The respondents contended before the payment of wages authority that the refusal of the appellant to pay to them wages at the rate awarded in substance amounted to an illegal deduction from their wages and on that basis they asked for an order from the authority directing the appellant to pay to the respondents the said prescribed wages.
The appellant raised two pleas against the respondents  claim.
The appellant challenged the correctness of the conclusion of the authority that the applications made by the res pondents were competent under section 15 of the Act before the Patna High Court by filing a petition under article 226 of the Constitution.
Section 2vi as it stood at the relevant time provides inter alia that wages means all remuneration capable of being expressed in terms of money which would if the terms of the contract of employment express or implied were fulfilled be payable.
We are not inclined to hold that even under the unamended definition of wages rates of remuneration prescribed by an award could not be included.
The true legal position is that when industrial disputes are decided by industrial adjudication and awards are made the said awards supplant contractual terms in respect of matters covered by them and are substituted for them.
