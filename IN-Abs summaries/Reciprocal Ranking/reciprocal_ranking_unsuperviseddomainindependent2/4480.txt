Civil Appeal No 213 of 1979 filed by the Bharat Aluminium Company Ltd arises out of Misc.
Petition No 555 of 1977 filed by it in the High Court of Madhya Pradesh under Article 226 of the Constitution.
Respondent 1 is the Special Area Development Authority Korba District Bilaspur MP respondent 2 is its Chairman and respondent 3 is the State of Madhya Pradesh.
Civil Appeals Nos 1025 and 1026 of 1978 are by Western Coalfields Ltd The appellant Bharat Aluminium Company Ltd is a Government Company incorporated under the  the entire share capital being owned by the Government of India.
Section 55 provides that for every Special Area there shall be a Special Area Development Authority consisting of a Chairman and such other members as the Government may determine from time to time.
The Chairman and the members of the Development Authority are appointed by the Government.
Section 68 which prescribes the functions of the Development Authority lays down by clauses v and vi that the Development Authority shall make provision for the municipal services and municipal management of the Special Area.
Section 69 by clauses c and d confers upon the Development Authority powers for the purpose of municipal administration and for the purpose of taxation.
They should better have not been so numbered alphabetically since the main clauses themselves are similarly numbered.
Since there was no Municipal Corporation or Municipal Council in the Korba Special Area prior to the constitution of the Development Authority the Government was required under sub clause b above to direct whether the Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act 1956 or the Madhya Pradesh Municipalities Act 1961 shall apply to the Korba Special Area for the purposes of clauses v and vi of section 68 and clauses c and d of section 69.
Such a direction was first issued by Notification dated January 28 1976 published in the Government Gazette dated February 27 1976 by which the Development Authority Korba was directed to exercise the powers and perform the functions of a Class I Municipality constituted under the Madhya Pradesh Municipality Act 1961.
This Notification became effective from February 271976 from which date Ordinance No 26 of 1975 was made effective.
By another Notification dated March 15 1977 published in Government Gazette dated July 15 1977 the Development Authority Korba was directed under the aforesaid clauses of sections 68 and 69 to exercise the powers and perform the functions under the Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act 1956.
Section 1271i of the Madhya Pradesh Municipalities Act 1961 empowers a municipal council to impose in the whole or any part of the municipality a tax payable by the owners of houses buildings or lands situated within the limits of Municipality with reference to annual letting value of the house building or land called property tax.
It says that the Corporation shall impose a tax payable by the owners of buildings or lands situated within the city with reference to the gross annual letting value of the building or land called the property tax.
By section 36 of the aforesaid Adhiniyam local authorities were prohibited from recovering the property tax from November 24 1970.
Rs 6000.
That amount not having been paid as provided in the agreement respondent 1 terminated the agreement by its letter dated February 4 1977.
11 The appellant Company disputed its liability to pay the aforesaid amounts on the grounds principally that no tax was leviable on its property since the Company was owned wholly by the Government of India and that respondent 1 was estopped from levying the property tax by reason of the agreement of 1976.
In the other two appeals Nos 1025 and 1026 of 1978 the appellant Western Coalfields Ltd is also a hundred per cent undertaking of the Government of India.
