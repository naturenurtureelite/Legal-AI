RKKapoor and Anis Ahmed Khan for the Appellant.

Delay condoned.
Special leave granted.
The right of preemption based on consanguinity was held to be a relic of the feudal past totally inconsistent with the constitutional philosophy and scheme.
It also found the list of kinsfolk entitled to pre emption as intrinsically defec tive and Self contradictory.
The right of pre emption in regard to a co sharer was upheld on the consideration that if an outsider is introduced as a co sharer in a property it will make common management extremely difficult and destroy the benefits of ownership in common.
Read in the context it becomes clear that the legislature desired to confer the right of pre emption on specified family members of the vendor or vendors in the first three clauses of section 151b and with a view to covering all the remaining co sharers not specifically mentioned the preceding clauses it used the expression other co sharers  in the fourth clause which was meant to serve as a residuary clause to ensure 127 that no co sharer is left out.
Since this Court found certain intrinsic contradictions in the list of relatives covered by the first three clauses it saw no justification for the classification contained in the said provision conferring a right based on consanguinity and therefore struck down those clausesas discriminatory and violative of Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution.
At the same time it upheld the right conferred on co sharers for reasons stated earlier.
There will be no order as to costs throughout.
