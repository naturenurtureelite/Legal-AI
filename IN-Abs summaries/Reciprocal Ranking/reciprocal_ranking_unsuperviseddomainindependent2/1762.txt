section K Kapur and B R G K Achar for the appellant in allthe appeals.
R P Modi and R K Garg for the respondents in CA No 8871962.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by WANCHOO J.
These four appeals arise out of four certi ficates granted by the High Court of Rajasthan and raise a common question.
The suit out of which appeal No 887 has arisen was filed by the respondent against the State of Rajasthan.
The respondent was a resident of the former Dholpur State and the dispute which led to the suit related to a time before the merger of former Dholpur State into the Matsya Union.
It was also the practice in that State that when permits for export were issued export duties had to be paid in advance though the actual export was made later.
His case further was that though he asked the State for refund of this advance duty the State did not pay back the same to him.
By May 15 1949 the United State of Rajasthan was formed including the Matsya Union into which the former State of Dholpur had merged on March 17 1948.
The United State of Rajasthan eventually became the Part B State of Rajasthan on January 26 1950 when the Constitution came into force.
The suits were resisted by the State of Rajasthan on various grounds but we are concerned now only with one ground which alone has been urged before us namely that the State of Rajasthan was not bound by any liability which might have arisen against the former State of Dholpur.
Then came another union of certain other Rulers in Rajasthan in March 1948 by which these Rulers united under the Ruler of Udaipur to form what later came to be known as the Former State of Rajasthan.
