156 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Hegde J.
These cases are the outcome of an unfortunate conflict between the High Court and the government of Orissa.
Neither the High Court as such nor the Governor has any hand in his appointment.
The power to appoint the secretaries to the government is that of the Governor.
Under the Government of India Act 1935 the power to transfer a district judge from one post to another was that of the Governor though that power was always exercised in consultation with the High Court and by and large on the recommendation of the High Court.
Obviously when the Governor promulgated the Orissa Superior Judicial Service Rules 1963 he proceeded on the basis that the power to transfer the district judges and addl.
It appears that for some time past there were differences between the High Court and the government about the posting of some of the judicial officers.
The High Court was anxious that a judicial officer occupying one of the administrative posts enumerated above should not in the interest of judicial work continue in that post for an unduly long time.
But those requests were not respected.
He worked in that capacity till February 1965.
That was a non cadre post.
in the interest of the service as well as the officers so that Officers may not deteriorate by remaining out of touch from regular judicial work for continuously long periods and the service will not suffer by being deprived of the services of senior and experienced officers in manning the posts in the regular judicial line.
The above.
Shri Sarjoo Prasad learned counsel for the High Court of Orissa at the very commencement of his arguments conceded that the order of the High Court holding that those officers had no authority to hold the posts in question is unsustainable.
 It is not a profitable task to extract a sentence here and there from a judgment and to build upon it.
