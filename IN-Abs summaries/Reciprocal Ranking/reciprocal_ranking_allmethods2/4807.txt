JD Jain  Mrs Kawaljit Kocher for the Appellant.
On January 21 1974 he was promoted as a Head Clerk on an ad hoc basis.
On April 1 1975 the appellant was appointed as a Head Clerk.
He was therefore entitled to be absorbed in Government service as a clerk in any event.
But as a result of the deletion of section 33 of the Act by the Amending Act of 1973 the Panchayat Samiti lost its power to make appointments to the Panchayat.
the Panchayat.
737 It is urged by Shri Jain who appears on behalf of the appellant that by reason of section 144 of the Amending Act the appellant was entitled to continue in the service of the Panchayat on the same terms and conditions on which he was employed by the Panchayat Samiti until he was absorbed in Government service.
Even assuming for the purposes of argument that the right to be considered for promotion is a term and condition of service what is relevant for our purpose is not whether the appellant was entitled to be considered for promotion but whether the Panchayat Samiti had the right to appoint him to the post of Head Clerk on the date on which it purported to do so.
The appointment of the appellant to the post of a Head Clerk being without the authority of law the Government was not bound to absorb him in the post of a Head Clerk.
He was appointed lawfully to the post of a Clerk and that is the post in which the Government has absorbed him.
