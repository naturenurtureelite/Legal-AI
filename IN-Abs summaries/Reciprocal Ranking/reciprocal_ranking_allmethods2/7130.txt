Against the said decree both the defendants preferred an appeal No 8285.
Feeling aggrieved by the order of dismissal of the appeal the defendants preferred separate Second Appeals Nos.
The first ground on which the High Court dismissed the suit is that the suit was barred by the principle of res judicata in view of the dismissal of the former suit No 15768.
Sub rule 1 of Rule 2 inter alia provides that every suit shall include the whole of the claim which the plaintiff is entitled to make in respect of the cause of action.
The first suit was dismissed on the technical ground that since the plaintiff was not in de facto possession no injunction could be granted and a suit for a mere declaration of status without seeking the consequential relief for possession could not lie.
In the previous suit the relief for possession was not claimed whereas in the second suit the relief was for restoration of possession.
So also where a tenant is evicted illegally section 82 permits him to approach the Mamlatdar for recovery of possession.
Thus the amendment came into force during the pendency of the suit.
If a suit is filed to recover possession of agricultural land from a trespasser and no dispute arises the adjudication whereof is required to be done by the special machinery set up under the Act the Civil Court will continue to have jurisdiction.
In Shah Yograj Kuverji Oil Mills and Ginning Factory vs Subhash Chandra Yograj Sinha    the facts were that the landlord had filed a suit for eviction on April 25 1957 in the regular court ie the Court of the Joint Civil Judge Junior Division Erandol which admittedly had jurisdiction to pass a decree for possession of the demised premises.
What procedure should the court follow in such situations It would not stand to reason to non suit the plaintiff who had filed the suit in a competent court having jurisdiction to try the same merely because of the subsequent change in law.
RP Appeal allowed.
