Now proceed to record our reasons.
Therefore his conviction and sentence awarded to him have become final.
Therefore the High Court did not place any reliance on this circumstance namely recovery of the blood stained shirt article 55 from the house of accused 6.
We are of the opinion that the retracted judicial confession of accused 5 could not be relied upon against accused 6 in this case in view of the fact that accused 6 who had been tried alongwith accused 5 had been acquitted by the High Court of the charge of conspiracy under section 302 read with section 120B IPC and accused 5 was not charged for the offence of murder of Malan for which only accused 1 6 and 7 were tried.
The Doctor found 9 incised wounds on various parts of the body of Malan besides a small incised injury on the right wall of the vagina outside in the middle and a small incised injury on the lower end of the vagina just at the mouth and he is of the opinion that all the 11 injuries were antemortem injuries which might have been caused by sharp cutting weapons that it is possible that injuries 5 to 7 found on the forehead and right and left side of the parietal eminance were 786 caused by hard and blunt objects that death must have been instantaneous and that injuries 1 to 7 collectively were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.
