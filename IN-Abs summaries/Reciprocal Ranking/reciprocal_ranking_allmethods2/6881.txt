Read in the context it becomes clear that the legislature desired to confer the right of pre emption on specified family members of the vendor or vendors in the first three clauses of section 151b and with a view to covering all the remaining co sharers not specifically mentioned the preceding clauses it used the expression other co sharers  in the fourth clause which was meant to serve as a residuary clause to ensure 127 that no co sharer is left out.
This Court never intended to exclude any speci fied co owners from the scope of clause fourthly of section 151b of the Act.
We find it diffi cult to hold that the purport of the of Court s decision in Attam Prakash s case was to deny the right of pre emption to those relative or relatives of the vendor or vendors who were specified in the erstwhile first three clauses of section 151b even if they happen to be co sharers.
If the preceding clauses were not erased from the statute book as unconstitu tional the kinsfolk would have exercised the right in the order of preference for which no justification was found.
The relations in the first three clauses of section 151b may or may not be co sharers The use of the expression other  in clause fourthly conveys the possibility of their being co sharer also.
That would clearly be discriminatory.
We think on a proper construction of that clause after the preceding clauses were held to be unconsti tutional the word other  preceding.
There will be no order as to costs throughout.
