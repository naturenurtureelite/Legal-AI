iminal Appeal No 46 of 1957.
Hardayal Hardy for the appellants.
H J Umrigar and B H Dhebar for the respondent.
April 21.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR J.
The next date of hearing was January 31 1952 and the proceedings went on till June 2 1952 when the appellant No 1 wrote to the Conciliation Officer saying that no useful purpose would be served by holding any further meetings.
The two appellants have appealed by special leave.
The question for decision is whether the conciliation proceedings could be said to be pending when Louis Pereira was dismissed.
The argument raised on behalf of the appellant is that the object of conciliation is to get a settlement made with expedition and therefore under section 12 the Conciliation Officer was bound to make his report within 14 days of the commencement of the conciliation proceedings or within such shorter period fixed by the appropriate Government.
The Act provides for commencement and conclusion of conciliation proceedings under section 20 but the first sub section of section 20 deals with what are called utility services and sub section 2 of that section provides as to when the conciliation proceedings conclude.
All conciliation proceedings under this sub section shall be deemed to have concluded in the case where no settlement is reached when the report of the Conciliation Officer is received by the appropriate Government.
It was contended that the conciliation proceedings should be held to terminate when the Conciliation Officer is required under section 126 of the Act to submit his report but the provisions of the Act above quoted do not support this contention as the termination of the conciliation proceedings is deemed to take place when the report is received by the appropriate Government.
Section 12 lays down the duties of the Conciliation officer.
The appeal is therefore dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
