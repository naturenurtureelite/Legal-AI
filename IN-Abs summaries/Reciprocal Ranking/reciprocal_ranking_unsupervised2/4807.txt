Civil Appeal No 1433 of 1977 Appeal by Special leave from the Judgment and Order dated the 16th February 1977 of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Civil Writ Petition No 752 of 1977.
JD Jain  Mrs Kawaljit Kocher for the Appellant.
On January 21 1974 he was promoted as a Head Clerk on an ad hoc basis.
The fact that the appellant was promoted as a Head Clerk on an ad hoc basis in January 1974 or the further fact that he was appointed as a Head Clerk on April 1 1975 cannot improve his position for the simple reason that these appointments were made after June 13 1973 being the date on which the Panchayat Samiti lost its power to make appointments to.
the Panchayat.
737 It is urged by Shri Jain who appears on behalf of the appellant that by reason of section 144 of the Amending Act the appellant was entitled to continue in the service of the Panchayat on the same terms and conditions on which he was employed by the Panchayat Samiti until he was absorbed in Government service.
Even assuming for the purposes of argument that the right to be considered for promotion is a term and condition of service what is relevant for our purpose is not whether the appellant was entitled to be considered for promotion but whether the Panchayat Samiti had the right to appoint him to the post of Head Clerk on the date on which it purported to do so.
There will be no order as to costs.
SR Appeal dismissed.
