6 have also taken a similar view.
We may now refer to some of the earlier decisions on this Point.
In re Varaszmha Rao11 a learned Single Judge of the Madras High Court took the view that the same persons cannot be charged in respect of the same years with offences punishable both under sections 131 and 134 Companies Act because section 134 clearly contemplates the sending of a copy of the balance sheet only after it has been placed before the company at a general meeting under section 131 and that where in a case there is no such placing of the balance sheet before the company at a general meeting the offence under section 134 cannot be committed.
We may now set out the reasoning which weighed with the Andhra Pradesh High Court in the decision under appeal  The reference to Section 210 by the use of the word aforesaid and the emphasis indicated by the words were so laid make the filing of copies of those balance sheets and the profit and loss accounts which are laid before the general body meeting an essential prerequisite.
