Mitter J This is an appeal by a certificate granted by the High Court at Calcutta from a judgment and decree in Second Appeal passed by that court in January 1961.
The learned Judge held that at the time when the appeal of the defendant was disposed of by the Subordinate Judge the rights of the parties were governed by the Thika Tenancy Act of 1949 and the definition of a thika tenant in that Act was not such as to afford any protection to the appellant.
S 4 provided It shall not be competent for a landlord to eject any thika tenant from his holding unless the landlord has given the thika tenant notice in the manner provided in section 106 of the  a in the case where he wishes to eject the thika tenant on any of the grounds specified in clauses i ii iii and iv of section 1 at least one month s notice in writing expiring with the end of a month of the tenancy and b in the case where he wishes to eject the thika tenant on the ground specified in clause iv of section 3 at least three months  notice in writing expiring with the end of a month of the tenancy.
Section 29 ran as follows The provisions of this Act shall apply to all suits and proceedings including proceedings  in execution for ejectment of a thika tenant which are pending at the date of commencement of this Act and if any such suit or proceeding relates to any matter in respect of which the Controller is competent after the date of such commendment to pass orders under this Act such suit or proceeding shall be transferred to the Controller who shall on suit transfer deal with it in accordance with the provisions of this Act as if this Act had been in operation on the date of institution of the suit or proceeding Provided that in applying the provisions of the Act to any suit or proceeding instituted for the ejectment of a thika tenant so transferred the provisions regarding notice in section 4 of this Act shall not apply.
It is however clear that the benefit of section 28 was available only if the decree or order for the recovery of possession had been made before the date of the commencement of the Act but 176 possession of such holding had not been recovered from him.
By section 2 of this Ordinance the definition of thika tenant in the Calcutta Thika Tenancy Act 1949 was substituted by a new one namely 5 thika tenant  means any person who holds whether under a written lease or otherwise land under another person and is but for a special contract would be liable to pay rent at a monthly or at any other periodical rate for that land to that another person and has erected any structure on such land for a residential manufacturing or business purpose and includes the successor in interest of such person but does not include a person a who holds such land under that another person in perpetuity or b who holds such land under that another person under a registered lease in which the duration of the lease is expressly stated to be for a period of not less than twelve years or c who holds such land under that another person and uses or occupies such land as a khattal.
1 of this section which enatced that Save as provided in sub section 2 the provisions of the said Act as amended by this Ordinance shall apply to all cases pending before a Court or Controller on the date of the commencement of this Ordinance.
2 of section 5 provided as follows If at any time between the commencement of the said  Act and of this Ordinance a decree or order has been passed for the recovery of possession of any land and for other relief if any and delivery of possession has not been given then on application made in this behalf by the person against whom the decree or order was passed within three months of the commencement of this Ordinance the Court which or the Controller who passed the decree or the order shall decide after hearing the parties and after taking fresh evidence if necessary whether the person is a thika tenant within the meaning of the said Act as amended by this Ordinance.
If the Court or Controller holds that the person is such a thika tenant.
2 of section 5 made a special provision for cases where a decree or order for possession had been made between the commencement of the Act and of the Ordinance and delivery of possession had not been given to the decree holder.
Sub section 2 of section 1 provided that the Act was to come into force immediately on the Calcutta Thika Tenancy Amendment Ordinance 1952 ceasing to operate provided that the provisions of the Calcutta Thika Tenancy Act 1949 as amended by this Act were subject to the provisions of section 9 to apply and be deemed to have always applied to all suits appeals and proceedings a before any court or b before the Controller or c before a person deciding an appeal under section 27 of the said Act on the date of the commencement of the Calcutta Thika Tenancy Amendment Ordinance 1952 ie 21st October 1952.
6 to have the same meaning as those used in the and the Bengal Tenancy Act 1885 it would but for the amendment of the definition of a thika tenant have meant only those persons who inherited from tenants and 179 not those who acquired by purchase.
2 of section 5 of the Calcutta Thika Tenancy Amendment Ordinance were to be continued as if such sub sections.
Consequently the absence of a notice under section 4 would not stand in the way of the landlord nor could his suit be rejected on the ground that he had not applied to the controller.
There being no provision for transfer of the proceedings of the suit to the controller the court had to apply the Act as it found applicable to the facts of the case.
He was not right in his view that the grounds specified in section 3 could not be called in aid.
