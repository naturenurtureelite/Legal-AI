March 24 1964.
The High Court has affirmed the finding of the authority and held that section 15 was applicable to the case because the wages prescribed by the award did amount to wages as defined by section 2vi of the Act.
The terms in question need not be express and can be implied but they must be terms which arise out of the contract of employment and since an award made by an Industrial Tribunal cannot be said to amount to a contract of employment the wage structure prescribed by the award cannot fall within the definition prescribed by section 2vi.
That in brief is the substance of the argument raised by the appellant.
In this connectionwe may incidentally refer to the decision of this Court in the South Indian Bank Ltd vs A R Chacko1 where it has been observed by this Court that the very purpose for which industrial adjudication has been given the peculiar authority and right of making new contracts between employers and workmen makes it reasonable to think that even though the period of operation of the award and the period for which it remains binding on the parties may elapse in respect of both of which special provisions have been made under sections 23 and 29 respectively the new contract would continue to govern the relations between the parties till it is replaced by another contract.
