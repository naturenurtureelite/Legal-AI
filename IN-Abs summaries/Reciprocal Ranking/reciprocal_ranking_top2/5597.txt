Learned counsel further contended that in the decision in Vineet Kumar s case supra on which reliance has been placed by learned counsel for the appellant the Firms Amar Naath Basheshar Dass s case supra has not been referred to and decision in Vineet Kumar s case supra is a judgment by a Bench of two Judges.
2 of the Act reads as under 2 Except as provided in sub section 5 of Section 12 sub section 1 A of Section 21 sub section 2 of Section 84 Sections 24 A 24 B 24 C or sub section 3 of Section 29 nothing in this Act shall apply to a building during a period of ten years from the date on which its construction is completed Provided that where any building is constructed substantially out of funds obtained by way of loan or advance from the State Government or the Life Insurance Corporation of India or a bank or a co operative society or the Uttar Pradesh Avas Evam Vikas Parishad and the period of repayment of such loan or advance exceeds the aforesaid 162 period of ten years then the reference in this sub section to the period of ten years shall be deemed to be a reference to the period of fifteen years or the period ending with the date of actual repayment of such loan or advance including interest whichever is shorter Explanation I For the purposes of this sub section a the construction of a building shall be deemed to have been completed on the date on which the completion thereof is reported to or otherwise recorded by the local authority having jurisdiction and in the case of a building subject to assessment the date on which the first assessment thereof comes into effect and where the said dates are different the earliest of the said dates and in the absence of any such report record or assessment the date on which it is actually occupied not including occupation merely for the purposes of supervising the construction or guarding the building under construction for the first time Provided that there may be different dates of completion of construction in respect of different parts of a building which are either designed as separate units or are occupied separately by the landlord and one or more tenants or by different tenants bconstruction includes any new construction in place of an existing building which has been wholly or substantially demolished c where such substantial addition is made to an existing building that the existing building becomes only a minor part thereof the whole of the building including the existing building shall be deemed to be constructed on the date of completion of the said addition.
This period of 10 years have to be computed in the manner from the date as indicated in Explanation 1 and it was contended by learned counsel for the respondents that it will be the date on which the first assessment was made and so far as this question is concerned it is also concluded by a decision of this Court in Om 163 Prakash Gupta s case supra where it has been clearly held while interpreting Sec.
2 Explanation I of this Act that if there is an assessment made then the date of completion of the building the date from which 10 years are to be computed will be the date on which the first assessment was made.
Pending suits for eviction relating to buildings brought under regulation for the first time In any suit for eviction of a tenant from any building to which the old Act did not apply pending on the date of commencement of this Act where the tenant within one month from such date of commencement or from the date of his knowledge of the pendency of the suit whichever be later deposits in the court before which the suit is pending the entire amount of rent and damages for use and occupation such damages for use and occupation being calculated at the same rate as rent together with interest thereon at the rate of nine cent per annum and the landlord s full cost of the suit no decree for eviction shall be passed except on any of the grounds 164 mentioned in the proviso to sub section 1 or in clauses b A to g of sub section 2 of Section 20 and the parties shall be entitled to make necessary amendment in their pleadings and to adduce additional evidence where necessary Provided that a tenant the rent payable by whom does not exceed twenty five rupees per month need not deposit any interest as aforesaid It is pertinent to note that this Section applies to those suits which were pending on the date of the commencement of this Act.
Pending appeals or revisions in suits for eviction relating to buildings brought under regulation for the first time Where an appeal or revision arising out of a suit for eviction of a tenant from any building to which the old Act did not apply is pending on the date of commencement of this Act it shall be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of Section 39 which shall mutatis mutandis apply 165 This Section talks of the pendency of a revision or an appeal arising out of a suit pending on the day on which this Act came into force.
It is clear that provisions of Section 40 will come to the rescue of the appellant tenant only if the suit from which revision or appeal arose was pending on the date of commencement of this Act ie 1571972 and therefore it could not be contended that the present revision petition or the appeal either to the High Court or the appellate authority arose out of suit which was pending on the date on which this Act came into force.
It is well settled that the rights of the parties will be determined on the basis of the rights available to them on the date of the suit but in Vineet Kumar s case supra this Court took the view that if during the pendency of the proceedings 10 years have elapsed the tenant is entitled to the protection under the Act and in coming to this conclusion the Court also considered the language of Section 39 of the Act and it observed The appellant in the present case only seeks the protection of the new Rent Act which became applicable to the premises in question during the pendency cf the litigation.
Bar of suit for eviction of tenant except on specified grounds 1 Save as provided in sub section 2 no suit shall be instituted for the eviction of a tenant from a building notwithstanding the determination of his tenancy by efflux of time or on the expiration of a notice to quit or in any other manner Provided that nothing in this sub section shall bar a suit for the eviction of a tenant on the determination of his tenancy by efflux of time where the tenancy for a fixed term was entered into by or in pursuance of a compromise or adjustment arrived at with reference to a suit appeal revision or execution proceedings which is either recorded in court or otherwise reduced to writing and signed by the tenant.
Keeping in view the language of this Section if we examine the provisions contained in sub section 2 of Section 2 it will be clear that for a newly constructed building the provisions of this Act will not apply for 10 years and therefore so far as the restriction under Section 20 is concerned they will not apply and therefore it is clear that within 10 years as provided for in clause 2 of Section 2 restriction of the 167 institution of suit as provided for in Section 20 clause 1 quoted above will not be applicable and it is thus clear that during the pendency of the litigation even of 10 years expired the restriction will not be attracted as the suit has been instituted within 10 years and therefore restriction as provided for in Section 20 can not be attracted.
In this view of the matter therefore the appeal is without any substance and is dismissed.
