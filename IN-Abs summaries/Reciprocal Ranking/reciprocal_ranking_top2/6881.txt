2 Notwithstanding anything con tained in sub section 1 a  where the sale is by a female of land or property to which she has succeeded through her father or brother or the sale in respect of such land or property is by the son or daughter of such female after inheritance the right of pre emption shall vest i if the sale is by such female in her brother or brother s son ii if the sale is by the son or daughter of such female in the mother s brothers or the mother s brother s sons of the vendor or vendors b where the sale is by a female of land or property to which she has succeeded through her husband or through her son in case the son has inherited the land or property sold from his lather the right of pre emption shall vest First in the son or daughter of such husband of the female Secondly in the husband s brother or hus band s brother s son of such female This Court in Atam Prakash vs State of Haryana  Ors   held that the right of pre emption given to co sharers as well as to a tenant can be justified as they constitute a class by themselves.
Where the sale is of a share out of joint land or property and is not made by all the co sharers jointly only the other co sharers and the tenants can exercise the right of pre emption.
We therefore do not approve the ratio of Jagdish s case and overrule the same.
