Applications by respondent No 1 for revocation of the certificate granted by the Madras High Court on 15th October 1968 under article 1331a  b of the Constitution of India.
Article 133 1 provides insofar as it is material 1 An appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any judgment decree or final order in a civil proceeding of a High Court in the territory of India if the High Court certifies a that the amount or value of the subject matter of the dispute in the court of first instance and still in dispute on appeal was and is not less than twenty thou sand rupees or such other sum as may be specified in that behalf by Parliament by law or 701 b that the judgment decree or final order involves directly or indirectly some claim or question respecting property of the like amount or value or c   where the judgment decree or final order appealed from affirms the decision of the Court immediately below in any case other than a case referred to in sub clause c if the High Court further certifies that the appeal involves some substantial question of law.
The expression final order it has been held by a long course of authorities occurring in section 205 of the Government of India Act 1935 section 109 of the Code of Civil Procedure and article 1331 of the Constitution means a final decision on the rights of the parties in dispute in a suit or proceeding if the rights of the parties in dispute in the suit or proceeding remain to be tried after the order the order is not final.

Against that order an appeal was preferred to the Judicial Committee which was held not maintainable.
The trial court decided the issue against the appellant and the order was confirmed in appeal by the High Court of Bombay.
There is therefore abundant authority in support of the view that an order is final within the meaning of article 133 of the Constitution under section 109 Code of Civil Procedure or section 205 of the Government of India Act 1935 if it amounts to final decision on the rights of the parties in dispute in the suit or proceeding if after the order is made the suit or proceeding still remains to be tried and the rights in disputes have to be determined the order is interlocutory.
This Court held Bachawat  Mitter JJ dissenting that the order passed was a final order within the meaning of article 1341 c since the controversy between the parties when the the complaint in respect of offences under sections 467 and 468 read with section 114 IP Code was disposed of by the order of dismissal and the proceeding regarding that question was finally decided It was observed that the finality of that order was not to be judged by co relating it with the controversy in the complaint viz when then the appellant had committed the offence charged against him therein.
