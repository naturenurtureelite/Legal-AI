It is said that it would be violative of the Constitutional right of equal pay for equal work.
the pay scale recommended by the Pay Rationalisation Committee the nature of duties and responsibilities and the fact that every Hon ble Judge will have one Private Secretary in the scale of Rs500 1000 we feel that the Bench Secretaries cannot be given the same scale of pay which is being given to Superintendents or the Section Officers.
In this connection I have also been directed to say that the nomenclature of posts of 10 Bench Secretaries appearing in column 5 of the said table shall be Bench Secretaries Grade I and the nomenclature of rest Bench Secretaries of equal pay scale will be Bench Secretaries Grade II and the posts of Bench Secretaries Grade I and Grade II will be of the same duties and responsibilities.
The Bench Secretaries Grade 1 are in a higher pay scale than Bench Secretaries Grade II.
