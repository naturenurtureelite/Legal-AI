ivil Appeal Nos.
The Tribunal held that at the time of removal the goods were delivered from the factory in packed condition and the containers were not returnable by the buyer there fore the value had to be included in the assessable value.
It was submitted that while deter mining the scope and nature of levy as contemplated under section 3 of the Act of central excise and the measure of such levy as provided in section 4 of the Act the principles laid down in Union of India vs Bombay Tyre International Ltd supra should be followed and reliance was placed on the several decisions of this Court which we will refer to later.
For the purposes of this sub clause the amount of the duty of excise payable on any excisable goods shall be the sum total of a the effective duty of excise payable on such goods under this Act and b the aggregate of the effective duties of excise payable under other Central Acts if any providing for the levy of duties of excise on such goods  and the effective duty of excise on such goods under each Act referred to in clause a or clause b shall be i in a case where a notification or order providing for any exemption not being an exemption for giving credit with respect to for reduction or duty of excise under such Act on such goods equal to any duty of excise under such Act or the additional duty under Section 3 of the 51 of 1975 already paid on the raw material or component parts used in the production or manufacture of such goods from the duty of excise under such Act is for the time being in force the duty of excise computed with refer ence to the rate specified in such Act in respect of such goods as reduced so as to give full and complete effect to such exemption and ii in any other case the duty of excise computed with reference to the rate specified in such Act in respect of such goods.
According to the learned Attorney General since the Act provides for only one exception to this measure namely non inclusion of the cost of such packing where the packing is durable in nature and is returnable by the buyer to the assessee in all other cases the cost of the packing would have to be included in the assessable value of the excisable goods where such goods are delivered at the time of removal in packed condition.
In the premises the value of the drums with regard to the fusel oilstyrene monomer irrespective of whether these were supplied by the assessee or not are not includible in the assessable value of the Styrene Monomer.
However I append this short note only to emphasize that in my opinion also the view taken by all of us on the construction of section 44di of the here inafter referred to as the Act is alone sufficient in the present matters to support the conclusion we have reached and it does not appear necessary to consider the wider propositions canvassed by the two sides.
