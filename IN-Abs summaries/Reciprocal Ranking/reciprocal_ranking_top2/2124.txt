DN Mukherjee for the respondent in CA No 931 of 1965 and the appellant in CA No 1149 of 1965.
In our view it was open to the respondent to show that the appellant belonged to the Saha caste group within the Sunri caste group and did not therefore belong to the Schedule Caste specified in item 40 as he claimed.
He also held that the evidence did not establish that the Sahas formed a sub caste strictly so called within the Sunri caste of a caste wholly independent of the Sunri caste.
The learned Judge however appears to have set aside the decision of the Tribunal and directed the election of the appellant to be set aside on the ground that the appellant bore the surname Saha and was thereby excluded from the Scheduled Caste specified in item 40 for he said these Saha families within the fold of Sunri caste distinguished themselves by their surname whatever might be their other characteristics and have come to form a class apart from the rest of the Sunris.
The learned Judges of the High Court thought that the effect of the item was to exclude from the Sunri caste those who belonged to that caste but bore the surname Saha.
Nobody disputes that.
