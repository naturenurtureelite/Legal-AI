When is a sale or purchase of goods said to take place in the course of import or export 1 A sale or purchase of goods shah be deemed to take place in the course of the export of the goods out of the territory of India only if the sale or purchase either occasions such export or is effected by a transfer of documents of title to the goods after the goods have crossed the customs frontiers of India.
The argument on behalf of the Revenue which has found favour with the High Court is that section 91 exempts only sales made in the course of export within the meaning of section 51 of the CST Act but not those under section 53 of the said Act.
There is however nothing unconstitutional about the two other consequences that flow on the language of the clause one express and the other implied one in favour of the Revenue and the other in favour of the assessee viz 364 1 that there will be a tax on the purchase of the raw materials if the manufactured goods are disposed of in the State itself otherwise than by way of sale and 2 that there will be no tax on the purchase of the raw materials if the manufactured goods are despatched from the State consequent on a i local sale ii inter State sale or iii a sale in the course of export.
The appeals and petitions are therefore allowed.
