N Criminal Appeal No 317 of 1986 From the Judgment and order dated 2721986 of the Patna High Court in CWJC No 33 of 1986.
Criminal Appeal No 317 of 1986 arises out of the judgment and order of the High Court of Patna and the Writ Petition No 316 is in respect of the same detenu.
Katras PS Case No 30383 us 147148452323 IPC.
19683 has already been submitted in this case.
Jogta PS Case No 6885 dated 11285 us 34134 IPC.
The petitioner appellant was in detention when the petitionerappellant was served with the order of detention.
There were criminal cases against the petitioner.
910 It is the contention of the petitionerappellant that the order of preventive detention could only be justified against a person in detention if the detaining authority was satisfied that his release from detention was imminent and the order of detention was necessary for putting him back in jail.
The grounds stated that there was indiscriminate firing on 24th December 1985 on Katras Coal Dump and the petitioner started indiscriminate firing to kill Birendra Pratap Singh a rival of his calendestine business of coal to establish the criminal superiority in full view of the shopkeepers customers and passers by of the area.
From the affidavit of the District Magistrate it does not appear that either the prospect of immediate release of the detenu or other factors which can justify the detention of a person in detention were properly considered in the light of the principles noted in the aforesaid decision and especially in the decisions in Rameshwar Shaw vs District Magistrate Burdwan  Anr  and Ramesh Yadav vs District Magistrate Etah and others though there was a statement to the effect that the petitioner was in jail and was likely to be enlarged on bail.
In this case there were grounds for the passing of the detention order but after that the detenu has surrendered for whatever reasons therefore the order of detention though justified when it was passed but at the time of the service of the order there was no proper consideration of the fact that the detenu was in custody of that there was any real danger of his release.
If however the detenu is released on bail in the aforesaid criminal cases the matter of service of the detention order under the Act on the aforesaid materials may be reconsidered by the appropriate authority in accordance with the law.
