This Court allowed the appeal of accused 1 and set aside his conviction under 120B IPC holding that the conviction of one of the accused alone was unsustainable in law having regard to the requirement of s120A IPC Mr OP Rana learned senior counsel appearing for the state of Maharashtra sought to support the judgment of the High Court in this case against accused 5 in view of the conviction of accused 1 and 6 for the murder of Malan under s 302 read with section 34 IPC We repelled that submission of Mr Rana in view of the fact that those two accused 1 and 6 had been acquitted by the trial court of charge No 1 farmed against them under section 302 read with section 120B IPC and no appeal against their acquittal had been filed in the High Court and also the fact that accused 5 was not a party to charge No4 which was framed only against accused 1 6 and 7.
As regards accused 6 in the High Court reliance was placed by the prosecution on four pieces of evidence besides the evidence of the approver PW 1 and the retracted confession of accused 5.
