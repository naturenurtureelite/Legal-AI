The appellant had in this petition prayed for the issue of a writ quashing the resolution dated April 6 1964 passed by the Standing Committee Zila Parishad Nagpur and for a writ of mandamus directing the Standing Committee not to interfere with the right of the appellant to impose and collect the octroi duty pursuant to its resolution dated February 25 1963.
The learned counsel for the appellant contends before us 1 that r 5 of the Fees Rules was intraviress 2 that the Standing Committee had no jurisdiction to decide the appeal on merits as the appeal to the Panchayat Samiti was barred by limitation 3 that the octroi duty has been levied in accordance with law 4 that at any rate the levy was good after the octroi limits were fixed on January 14 1964 5 that the approval of the octroi limits on January 14 1964 relates back to April 1 1963 and 6 that the tea was imported into the Panchayat limits for consumption use or sale.
The octroi shall be paid at the octroi Naka at the time when the articles in respect of which it is leviable are imported into the octroi limits of a panchayat.
We are unable to allow him to raise this point at this stage.
The High Court has held that as r 5 applies to all appeals under s1245 of the Panchayat Act the fixing of the commencement of the period of limitation as the date of publication of the notice under r4 for all appeals is arbitrary and destructive of the right of appeal.
Rule 5 follows imme diately rr3 and 4 and is headed Appeal against levy of any tax or fee and the period of sixty days of limitation commences from the date of the publication of the notice under r4 ie the notice following the decision of a Panchayat to levy any tax or fee.
Accordingly.
