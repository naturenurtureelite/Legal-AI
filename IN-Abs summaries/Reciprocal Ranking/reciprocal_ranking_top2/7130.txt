The first ground on which the High Court dismissed the suit is that the suit was barred by the principle of res judicata in view of the dismissal of the former suit No 15768.
It will thus be seen that the Act sets up an independent machinery and invests the Mamlatdar with jurisdiction to decide questions such as  i Whether any person is a tenant or should be deemed to be a tenant under the Act ii Whether the possession of any tenant in regard to any land or dwelling house is threatened and if so whether an order safeguarding the same is required iii Whether the tenancy of any deemed tenant is legally terminated and if no whether the tenant evicted from the land held by him as such is entitled to restoration of possession The jurisdiction of the civil court is specifically barred by sub section 2 of Section 58 from settling deciding or dealing with any question which is by or under the Act required to be settled decided and dealt with by the Mamlatdar.
This question squarely arose for consideration by the Bombay High Court in Dhondi Tukaram vs Hari Dadu AIR 1954 Bom 100 ILR wherein that court observed as under Therefore we hold that in a suit filed against the defendant on the footing that he is a trespasser if he raises the plea that he is a tenant or a protected tenant the Civil Court would have no jurisdiction to deal with that plea .
We are therefore of the opinion that it would be just and fair that the issue whether defendant No1 was a tenant in respect of the lands in question should be referred to the Mamlatdar for decision and after his decision is received by the Civil Court if the issue is held against defendant No1 the Civil Court may consider passing of a decree in eviction but if on the other hand he is held to be tenant the Civil Court may be required to dismiss the suit.
RP Appeal allowed.
