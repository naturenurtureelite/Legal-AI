The suit was filed on the basis that the appellant as the lawfully appointed mahant was entitled to manage the properties of the Dera at Landeke that the defendant was unlawfully claiming to be the mahant of the Dera and entitled to manage the properties of the Dera and that the appellant was entitled to be in possession of the properties.
2 The attachment of a decree pending an appeal there from shall be deemed to be an interest entitling the person who procured such attachment to the benefit of sub rule 1.
The argument was that it was uncertain on the death of Som Dass as to who would become the mahant by election that it was only when a person succeeded to the mahantship on the death of a previous mahant by virtue of law 490 or custom that there would be devolution of interest in the subject matter of the suit and therefore Order 22 rule 10 would not be attracted.
We are of the view that devolution of the interest in the subject matter of the suit took place when Shiam Dass was elected as mahant of the Dera after the death of Som Dass.
VPS Appeal allowed.
