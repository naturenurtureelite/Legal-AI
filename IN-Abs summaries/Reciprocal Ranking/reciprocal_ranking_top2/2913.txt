 Section 147 deals with income escaping assessment.
Section 1392 says  In the case of any person who in the incometax Officer s opinion assessable under this Act whether on his own total income or on the total income of any other person during the previous year the Income tax Officer may before the end of the relevant assessment year serve a notice upon him requiring him to furnish within thirty days from the date of service of the notice a return of his income or the income of such other person during the previous year in the prescribed form and verified in the prescribed manner and setting forth such other particulars as may be prescribed proviso is not necessary for our present purpose When this appeal came up for hearing on the last occasion as we found the affidavit filed by the Income tax Officer to be vague and indefinite we directed the learned Counsel for the Department to produce before us the records of the Incometax Officer to show that the Income tax Officer had complied with the requirements of section 148 and section 1512 of the Act.
Hence proper investigation regarding these loans is necessary.
