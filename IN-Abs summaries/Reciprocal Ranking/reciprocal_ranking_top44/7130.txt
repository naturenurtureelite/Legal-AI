The High Court therefore held that the decree passed by the Civil Court was unsustainable.
The first ground on which the High Court dismissed the suit is that the suit was barred by the principle of res judicata in view of the dismissal of the former suit No 15768.
The lite is also the same.
Section 9 lays down the modes of termination of tenancy which are a by the tenant surrendering his right to the landlord in the manner provided in section 10 or b by the landlord terminating the tenancy on the grounds specified in section 11 or c under any other specific provision of the Act.
It will thus be seen that the Act sets up an independent machinery and invests the Mamlatdar with jurisdiction to decide questions such as  i Whether any person is a tenant or should be deemed to be a tenant under the Act ii Whether the possession of any tenant in regard to any land or dwelling house is threatened and if so whether an order safeguarding the same is required iii Whether the tenancy of any deemed tenant is legally terminated and if no whether the tenant evicted from the land held by him as such is entitled to restoration of possession The jurisdiction of the civil court is specifically barred by sub section 2 of Section 58 from settling deciding or dealing with any question which is by or under the Act required to be settled decided and dealt with by the Mamlatdar.
We are therefore of the opinion that it would be just and fair that the issue whether defendant No1 was a tenant in respect of the lands in question should be referred to the Mamlatdar for decision and after his decision is received by the Civil Court if the issue is held against defendant No1 the Civil Court may consider passing of a decree in eviction but if on the other hand he is held to be tenant the Civil Court may be required to dismiss the suit.
