It says that the Corporation shall impose a tax payable by the owners of buildings or lands situated within the city with reference to the gross annual letting value of the building or land called the property tax.
11 The appellant Company disputed its liability to pay the aforesaid amounts on the grounds principally that no tax was leviable on its property since the Company was owned wholly by the Government of India and that respondent 1 was estopped from levying the property tax by reason of the agreement of 1976.
Finally in State of Madhya Pradesh vs M V Narasimhan this Court held after an examination of the relevant decisions that the broad principle that where a subsequent Act incorporates provisions of a previous Act then the borrowed provisions become an integral and independent part of the subsequent Act and are totally unaffected by any repeal or amendment in the previous Act is subject to four exceptions one of which is that the principle will not apply to cases where the subsequent Act and the previous Act are supplemental to each other.
They provide Notwithstanding anything contained in this chapter as and from the financial year 1976 77 there shall be charged levied and paid for each financial year a tax on the lands or buildings or both at the rate specified in the table below Nothing further is required to be done by the Municipality or the Municipal Corporation in order to impose the property tax and therefore the procedure preliminary to the imposition of other taxes which is prescribed by sections 129 and 133 of the two Acts can 15 have no application to the imposition of the property tax.
The property tax is imposed by respondent 1 under section 127A of the Municipalities Act and section 135 of the Municipal Corporation Act.
It is therefore not necessary to follow the procedure prescribed by sections 129 and 133 of the respective Acts.
This position is made clear out of abundant caution by clause 4 of section 133 of the Municipal Corporation Act which provides that nothing contained in section 133 shall apply to the tax mentioned in clause a of sub section 1 of section 132 which shall be charged and levied in accordance with section 135.
What we have said is the plain meaning of the taxing provision.
The learned author after referring to English and American decisions has summed up the position in the words of an American Judge Sanborn J to the effect that as a general rule a corporation will be looked upon as a legal entity and an exception can be made when the notion of legal entity is used to defeat public convenience justify wrong protect fraud or defend crime in which case the law will regard the corporation as an association of persons.
But in order to 20 judge whether on that account the State legislature loses its competence to pass the Act of 1973 it is necessary to have regard to the object and purpose of that Act and to the relevant provisions thereof under which Special Area Development Authorities are given the power to tax lands and buildings within their jurisdiction.
one of which is to provide for the development and administration of Special Areas through Special Area Development Authorities Section 64 of the Act of 1973 which provides for the constitution of the special areas lays down by sub section 4 that Notwithstanding anything contained in the Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act 1956 the Madhya Pradesh Municipalities Act 1961 or the Madhya Pradesh Panchayats Act 1962 the Municipal Corporation Municipal Council Notified Area Committee or a Panchayat as the case may be shall in relation to the special area and as from the date the Special Area Development Authority undertakes the functions under clause v or clause vi of section 68 cease to exercise the powers and perform the function and duties which the Special Area Development Authority is competent to exercise and perform under the Act of 1973.
The power conferred by the State Legislature on Special Area Development Authorities to impose the property tax on lands and buildings is therefore not in conflict with the power conferred by the Coal Mines Nationalisation Act on the Union Government to regulate and develop the Coal mines so as to ensure rational and scientific utilisation of coal resources.
The second sub rule added to Rule 20 was held to be without jurisdiction for the same reason.
