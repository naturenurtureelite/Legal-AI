To sum up then our conclusions may be stated thus The discretion conferred on the Central Government by section 237b to order an investigation and delegated by it to the Company Law Board is administrative that it could be validly exercised by the Chairman of the Board by an order made in pursuance of a rule enacted by the Central Government under section 6421 read with section 10E5 that the exercise of the power does not violate any fundamental right of the company that the opinion to be formed under section 237b is subjective and that if the grounds are disclosed by the Board the Court can examine them for considering whether they are relevant.
Without prejudice to its powers under section 235 the Central Government a b may do so ie appoint one or more competent persons as inspectors to investigate etc if in the opinion of the Central Government there are circumstances suggesting i that the business of the company is being conducted with intent to defraud its creditors members or any other persons or otherwise for a fraudulent or unlawful purpose or in a manner oppressive of any of its members or that the company was formed for any fraudulent or unlawful purpose ii that persons concerned in the formation of the company or the management of its affairs have in connection therewith been guilty of fraud misfeasance or other misconduct towards the company or towards any of its members or iii that the members of the company have not been given all the information with respect to its affairs which they might reasonably expect including information relating to the calculation of the commission payable to a managing or other director the managing agent the secretaries and treasurers or the manager of the company.
The order dated May 19 1965 was passed by the Chairman of the Company Law Board Mr Setalvad submitted that only the Board could pass an order under section 237 the Central Government could delegate its function under section 237 to the Board but it had no power to authorise the Chairman to sub delegate this function to himself and consequently the Company Law Board Procedure Rules 1964 made by the Central Government on February 1 1964 and the Chairman s order of distribution of business dated February 6 1964 delegating the function of the Board under section 237 to the Chairman are ultra vires the and the impugned order is invalid.
