Shri PC Dey.
It is at this stage the petitions which have given rise to those appeals were filed by some of the advocates practising in one or the other of the sessions divisions mentioned above praying for a writ of mandamus against the government as well as the concerned officers to implement the transfers ordered by the High Court on October 10 1966 and also a writ of quo warranto against Shri BK Patro Shri KK Bose and Shri PC Dey requiring them to show cause under what authority they were holding the posts of the law secretary the superintendent and legal remembrancer and member sales tax tribunal respectively.
It was not the case of the contesting respondents that Shri PC Dey Shri KK Bose and Shri BK Patro had not the necessary qualifications to hold the posts they were holding.
then the transfer of District Judges already appointed or promoted and posted in the cadre must necessarily be outside the power of the Governor and fall to be made by the High Court as part of the control vested in it by article 235 After analysing articles 233 and 235 and noticing the development of the law on the subject this Court held that under article 233 the Governor is only concerned with the appointment promotion and posting to the cadre of district judges but not with the transfer of district judges already appointed or promoted and posted to the cadre which power is vested in the High Court under article 235 as the control given to the High Court over the district courts under that Article includes control over the officers who preside over those courts.
He must depend on his department for information.
 Obviously relying on the observation of this Court that after a judicial officer is posted to the cadre it is for the High Court to effect his transfers the court below has come to the conclusion that as the posts of the law secretary deputy law secretary and superintendent and legal remembrancer are included in the cadre the High Court has the power to fill those posts by transfer of judicial officers.
 It is not a profitable task to extract a sentence here and there from a judgment and to build upon it.
The government in its turn should appreciate the anxiety of the High Court that judicial officers should not be allowed to acquire vested interest in the secretariat.
