In cases not governed by sections 18 and 19 where before the notified date a landholder has created any right in any land whether by way of lease or otherwise including rights in any forest mines or minerals quarries fisheries or ferries the transaction shall be deemed to be valid and all rights and obligations arising thereunder on or after the notified date shall be enforceable by or against the Government Provided that the transaction was not void or illegal under any law in force at the time Provided further that any such right created on or after the 1st day of July 1945 shall not be enforceable against the Government unless it was created for a period not exceeding one year  Provided also that where such right was created for a period exceeding one year unless it relates to the private land of the landholder within the meaning of section 3 clause 10 of the Estates Land Act the Government may if in their opinion it is in the public interest to do so by notice given to the person concerned terminate the right with effect from such date as may be specified in the notice not being earlier than three months from the date thereof.
Those provisions proceed on the assumption that certain laws passed under the Government of India Act 1935 did offend section 299 of that Act and expressly save those Acts.
In other words the third proviso according to learned counsel 559 for the appellant merely enables the Government to exercise the right conferred on it by the second proviso and therefore the Government if it intends to avail itself of the right under the second proviso must comply with the conditions laid down in the third proviso.
The implications of the second proviso learned counsel for the appellant points out are two fold namely a that all rights created before the notified date but after July 1 1945 for a period not exceeding one year would be valid and enforceable both by and against the Government by the operation of the body of sub section.
In other words the true meaning of the second proviso is said to be that rights created after July 1 1945 are only voidable at the instance of the Government and that being the position the Government must do some overt act to terminate the transaction.
2 must therefore be entitled to compensation under sub section.
That rule runs as follows  Rule In the case of any right in any land created by a landholder on or after the 1st day of July 1945 for a period exceeding one year and falling under the second proviso to section 201 of the said Act the authority to decide whether the right should be terminated or allowed to continue shall be the Board of Revenue.
Appeals dismissed.
