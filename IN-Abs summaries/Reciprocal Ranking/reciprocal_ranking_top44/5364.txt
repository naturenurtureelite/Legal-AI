1977 by the Life Insurance Corporation of India hereinafter referred to as the Corporation  which pro vides that an employee belonging to Class I or Class II appointed to the service of the Corporation on or after 1st September 1956 shall retire on completion of 58 years of age but the competent authority may if it is of the opinion that it is in the interest of the Corporation to do so direct such employee to retire on completion of 50 years of age and at any time thereafter on giving him three months  notice or salary in lieu thereof.
Transfer of service of existing employees of insurers to the Corporation 1 Every whole time employee of an insurer whose controlled business has been transferred to and vested in the Corporation and who was employed by the insurer wholly or mainly in connection with his controlled business immediately before the appointed day shall on and from the appointed day become an employee of the Corporation and shall hold his office therein by the same tenure at the same remuneration and upon the same terms and conditions and with the same rights and privi leges as to pen 190 sion and gratuity and other matters as he would have held the same on the appointed day if this Act had not been passed and shall continue to do so unless and until his employ ment in the Corporation is terminated or until his remuneration terms and conditions are duly altered by the Corporation Provided that nothing contained in this sub section shall apply to any such employee who has by notice in writing given to the Central Government prior to the ap pointed day intimated his intention of not becoming an employee of the Corporation.
Parliament therefore enacted sub section 2 of section 11 of the Act which provided that notwithstanding anything contained in sub section 1 of section 11 or in any contract of service the Central Government might for the purposes of rationalising the pay scales of employees of insurers whose controlled business had been transferred to and vested in it or for the purposes of reducing the remu neration payable to those employees in cases where in the interest of the Corporation and its policyholders a reduc tion was called for alter the terms of service of the employees as to their remuneration in such manner as it thought fit and if the alteration was not acceptable to any employee the Corporation might terminate his employment on giving him compensation equivalent to three months  remuner ation unless the contract of service with such employee provided for a shorter notice of termination.
Thereafter sub section 2 of sec tion 11 of the Act read as follows 2 Where the Central Government is satisfied that for the purpose of securing uniformity in the scales of remuner ation and the other terms and conditions of service applica ble to employees of insurers whose controlled business has been transferred to and vested in the Corporation it is necessary so to do or that in the interest of the Corpora tion and its policy holders a reduction in the remuneration payable or a revision of the other terms and 193 conditions of service applicable to employees or any class of them is called for the Central Government may notwith standing anything contained in sub section 1 or in the  or in any other law for the time being in force or in any award settlement or agree ment for the time being in force alter whether by way of reduction or otherwise the remuneration and the other terms and conditions of service to such extent and in such manner as it thinks fit and if the alteration.
To remove the above doubt by Act 17 of 1957 section 49 of the Act was amended by introducing clause bb in sub section 2 of section 49 of the Act which expressly conferred power on the Corporation to make regulations with the previous approval of the Central Government as regards the terms and condi tions of service of persons who have become employees of the Corporation under sub section 1 of section 11 .
Leave and retirement In the matter of leave and retire ment Field Officers shall be governed by the same regula tions as are applicable to Class I officers of the Corpora tion.
These employees demanded that their age of retirement should also be fixed at 60 years as in the case of Class III and Class IV employ ees belonging to the category of transferred employees.
2A Notwithstanding what is stated in sub regula tions 1 and 2 above an employee may be permitted to retire at any time after he has completed age 55      On account of the settlement arrived at between Class III and Class IV employees who were appointed subsequent to 1st September 1956 and the Corporation which was followed up by the amendment of the Staff Regulations with effect from 1961965 the employees of the Corporation were divid ed both longitudinally and latitudinally insofar as the age of superannuation was concerned.
All the transfer 200 red employees belonging to Class I and Class II became entitled to continue in service till they attained the age of 60 years subject of course to the power of the Corpora tion to retire any of them prematurely on completion of 55 years of age if his efficiency was found to have been im paired and all the Class I and Class II officers appointed to the service of the Corporation on or after 1st September 1956 had to retire on completion of 58 years of age subject again to the power of the Corporation to retire any such employee on completion of 55 years of age or at any time thereafter if his efficiency was found to have been im paired.
All the employees belonging to Class III and Class IV irrespective of the fact whether they were transferred employees or employees appointed after 1st September 1956 were entitled to continue in service till 60 years of age but the employees belonging to Class I and Class II who were appointed to the service of the Corpora tion on or after 1st September 1956 had to retire on the completion of 58 years of age subject to the usual clause relating to premature retirement.
The Central Government and the Corporation felt that 60 years of age could be a proper age of retirement in the circumstances in respect of the transferred employees and that was the reason why by regulation 19 and the standardisation order issued earlier in the case of certain classes of transferred em ployees under section 112 of the Act the retirement age was fixed at 60 years and this was done with a view to retaining the services of the experienced employees of the erstwhile insurers.
1 guarantees to the trans ferred employee the same tenure at the same remuneration and upon the same terms and conditions on the transfer to the Corporation as he enjoyed on the appointed day under the insurer and he is entitled to them until they are duly altered by the Corporation or his employment in the Corpora tion is terminated.
The observation made by Pathak J in the course of his judgment that there is no danger of an order made by the Central Government under the second limb of sub section 2 in respect of transferred employeesbeing struck down on the ground that it violates the equality provisions of Part III of the Constitution because similar action has not been taken in respect of newly recruited employees is signifi cant.
The notification further provided that apprentice train examiners who had already been absorbed in grade D  before April 1966 should en bloc be accommodated in grade C  in the eighty per cent of the vacancies without undergoing any selection and with regard to twenty per cent of the vacancies reserved for the other class promotion was to be on selection basis and not on the basis of seniority cum suitability.
The relevant portion of the judgment of the High Court reads thus A reasonable classification which prevents a Court from dissecting it is one which includes all persons who are similarly situated with respect to the purpose of law or 216 objective which the rule or section seeks to achieve.
It appears to be the inten tion of Parliament that even as late as in 1981 that the two categories of employees namely the transferred employees and employees recruited after 1st September 1956 in the Corporation should be kept separate.
This Court had to deal with a case involving a similar situation in Railway Board vs A Pitchumani  Several railway companies which were running their own railways in different parts of India were amalaga mated with the Indian Railway Administration in 1947.
