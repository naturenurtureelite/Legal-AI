Appeal No 1375 of 1966.
Appeal from the judgment and order dated October 22 1965 of the Bombay High Court Nagpur Bench in Special Civil Application No 355 of 1964.
M N Phadke and Naunit Lal for the appellant.
B R Agarwala and section B Nerkar for respondent No 1.
The learned counsel for the appellant contends before us 1 that r 5 of the Fees Rules was intraviress 2 that the Standing Committee had no jurisdiction to decide the appeal on merits as the appeal to the Panchayat Samiti was barred by limitation 3 that the octroi duty has been levied in accordance with law 4 that at any rate the levy was good after the octroi limits were fixed on January 14 1964 5 that the approval of the octroi limits on January 14 1964 relates back to April 1 1963 and 6 that the tea was imported into the Panchayat limits for consumption use or sale.
The octroi shall be paid at the octroi Naka at the time when the articles in respect of which it is leviable are imported into the octroi limits of a panchayat.
Apart from the fact that it may in certain circumstances lead to illegal levies there is nothing in the language of r21 which indicates that the Collector can regularise an imposition made without the authority of law.
Rule 5 follows imme diately rr3 and 4 and is headed Appeal against levy of any tax or fee and the period of sixty days of limitation commences from the date of the publication of the notice under r4 ie the notice following the decision of a Panchayat to levy any tax or fee.
This date shows that r5 is dealing only with appeals against levy of any tax and not with the assessment or imposition of a tax or any further appeals to the Panchayat Simiti under section 1245.
Accordingly.
GC Appeal allowed.
