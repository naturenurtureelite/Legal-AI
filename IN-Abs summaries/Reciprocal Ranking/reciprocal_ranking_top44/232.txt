The main features of such procedure which mark a departure from the established procedure for criminal trials under the Code of Criminal Procedure are the elimination of the committal procedure in sessions cases and the substitu tion of the procedure laid down in the Code for trial of warrant cases by the Magistrate trial without jury or assessors restriction of the court s power in granting adjournments special powers to deal with refractory accused and dispensation of de novo trial on transfer of a case from one special court to another.
concurred applied the test of what may be called reasonable classification and held that although the need for a speedier trial than what is possible under the procedure prescribed 291 by the Code of Criminal Procedure might form the basis of a reasonable classification and section 5 1 could not be regarded as discriminatory in so far as it authorises the State Government to direct that certain offences or classes of offences or classes of cases should be tried by a special court the provision was discriminatory and violative of article 14 of the Constitution in so far as it purported to vest in the State Government an absolute and arbitrary power to refer to a special court for trial any cases  which must include an individual case whether the duration of such a case is likely to be long or not .
There can be no question at all that the cases were of a very exceptional character and although the offences committed were technically offences defined in the Indian Penal Code the Indian Arms Act and the High Explosives Act it would be futile to contend that the offenders in these cases were of the same class as ordinary criminals committing the same offences or that the acts which constituted the offences were of the ordinary types .
All these cases again have arisen out of serious disturbances which according to the prosecution partook of the nature of an organised revolt.
Some of my learned colleagues have examined the provi sions of the Act and shown that of the two procedures one laid down in the Act and the other in the Code the latter affords greater facilities to the accused for the purpose of defending himself than the former and once it is estab lished that one procedure is less advantageous to the ac cused than the other any person tried by a Special Court constituted under the Act who but for the Act would have been entitled to be tried according to the more elaborate procedure of the Code may legitimately enquire Why is this discrimination being made against me and why should I be tried according to a procedure which has not the same advantages as the normal procedure and which even carries with it the possibility of one s being prejudiced in one s defence  It was suggested that the reply to this query is that the Act itself being general and applicable to all persons and to all offences cannot be said to discriminate in favour of or against any particular case or classes of persons or cases and if any charge of discrimination can be levelled at all it can be levelled only against the act of the executive authority if the Act is misused.
Persons concerned in offences or cases needing so called speedier trial are entitled to inquire Why are they being made the subject of a law which has short circuited the normal procedure of trial why has it grouped them in that category and why has the law deprived them of the protection and safeguards which are allowed in the case of accused tried under the procedure mentioned in the Criminal Procedure Code what makes the legislature or the executive to think that their cases need speedier trial than those of others like them The only answer that so far as I am able to see the Act gives to these inquiries is that they are being made the subject of this special treatment because they need it in the opinion of the provincial government in other words because such is the choice of their prosecu tor.
It appears to be an accepted doctrine of American courts that the purpose of the equal protection clause is to secure every person within the States against arbitrary discrimination whether occasioned by the express terms of the statute or by their 1  331 improper application through duly constituted agents.
In the opinion of the learned Chief Justice if the State Govern ment had directed certain offences or classes of offences committed within the 1  332 territory of West Bengal to be tried by the Special Court the law or order could not have been impeached as discrimi natory.
In order to pass the test two conditions must be fulfilled namely 1 that the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes those that are grouped together from others 1  2  335 and 2 that that differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the Act.
The difference brought about by a statute may be of such a trivial unsub stantial and illusory nature that that circumstance alone may be regarded as cogent ground for holding that the stat ute has not discriminated at all and that no inequality has in fact been created.
Section 5 1 of the Act runs as follows  A Special Court shall try such offences or classes of offences or cases or classes of cases as the State Government may by general or special order in writing direct.
It is urged by the learned AttorneyGeneral that this selection of cases must also be made in the light of the object of the Act as expressed in its preamble that is to say the State government can only select those cases which in their view require speedier trial.
The short question that arises for consideration in these cases is whether the whole or any portion of the West Bengal Special Courts Act X of 1950 is invalid as being opposed to equality before the law and the equal protection of the laws guaran teed under article 14 of the Constitution of India.
