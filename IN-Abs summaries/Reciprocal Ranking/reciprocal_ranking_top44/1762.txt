Provision was also made in the Covenant that all the assets and liabilities of the covenanting States shall be the assets and liabilities of the new State of Matsya.
Thereupon there was a reference to a Full Bench on the question of liability which was formulated by the learned Judges thus Whether the expression Government of the corresponding State  used in article 2952 of the Constitution with reference to Rajasthan properly means the Government of the United State of Rajasthan which was the only Indian State in existence at the time of the commencement of the Constitution or it also includes the Government of any of the Covenanting States which had integrated with the United State before the Constitution came into operation.
In that case however this Court refused to treat article VI even as evidence because it pointed out that the first act of the new sovereign was the application of the Patiala State laws including the Patiala Income tax Act to the territories of Jind involving negation of the rights claimed in that case.
This is the basic difference between the Dalmia Dadri Cement Company case1 and the present case for in that case the old laws were repealed and thus repudiated in areas other than Patiala State while in the present case the old laws were continued till they were repealed or altered and in view of that basic difference between that case and the present case we can legitimately call in aid article VI of the Covenant and similar provisions which were always made throughout this process of merger in Rajasthan and treat them as evidence from which to come to the conclusion that the new State by continuing the old laws without change till they were repealed or altered recognised that it was liable in the same way as would have been the merging State if there was any liability on the merging State.
