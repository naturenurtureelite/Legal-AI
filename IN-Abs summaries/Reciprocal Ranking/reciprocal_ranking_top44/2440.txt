 On the basis of this finding of fact the Tribunal held that if the minimum wage in the Company is to be fixed more on the basis of the minimum wage prevailing in other industries in that region which in its opinion would be appropriate under the circumstances of the case then a revision was really necessary.
Having come to this view it is clear that to give full effect to the principle laid down by this Court the case of French Motor Car Co1 the Tribunal should have proceeded to fix the minimum wage in the Company on the basis of the average minimum wage prevailing in these concerns.
The Tribunal considered the minimum wages in these concerns on the basis of the prevailing Price Index of 441 a  Sambalpur taking 100 as the basic Price Index for the year 1939 Even when fixing the minimum wage for the Company on the basis of the alternative calculation made by the Tribunal the Tribunal has proceeded on the assumption that the minimum wage is being fixed for the Price Index No 441 prevailing at the time of the award taking 100 as the basic index for the year 1939 In these circumstances we think that the minimum wage in the Company should have been fixed by the Tribunalmensera following the principle laid down by this Court in the case of French Motor Car Co1.

Learned counsel was however unable to show to us that this Court or any other Tribunal has ever laid down the principle that where the dearness allowance forms a part of the consolidated wage fixed there should be such linking so as to bring in continuous variation of the wage depending on the variation in the Price Index.
It appears to us that an Industrial Tribunal has the discretion in appropriate cases of making a direction linking the dearness allowance element of a wage to the Price Index but at the same time the Tribunal is entitled to choose the alternative course of fixing the wage at the prevailing Price Index and leaving the labour to raise a fresh demand and if necessary a fresh industrial dispute for further rise in wages in case there is marked variation in the Price Index and the wage fixed in the award becomes out dated.
The idea of fixing such wage in the light of cost of living at a particular juncture of time and of neutralising the rising prices of essential commodities by linking up scales of minimum wages with the cost of living index cannot therefore be said to be alien to the concept of a minimum wage.
that the bonus is worked out on the basis of the total wages paid.
