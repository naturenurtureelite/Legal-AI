Appeals Nos 169 171 of 1955.
R Ganapathy Iyer and Shanmugavel for the appellants.
October 6.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SUBBA RAO J.
The appellants in the above three appeals and others filed writ petitions in the High Court of Madras against 1 the State of Madras 2 the Collectors of the concerned Districts and 3 the Chairmen of the Market Committees for the issue of a Writ of Mandamus directing the respondents to forbear from enforcing any or all the provisions of the Act as amended and the Rules and Bylaws framed thereunder.
It is also said that when a market is established no licence to purchase or sell commercial crops will be granted or renewed in respect of any place situated within such distance from the market as may from time to time be fixed by the State Government and that nothing under the Act prevents the Government from fixing a long distance as a prohibited area with the result that a person who is having a licence to trade in and about the place where the market is fixed is deprived of his livelihood which is an unreasonable restriction upon his right to do business.
It is also said that the same advantages could be given to the growers by continuing the said market with suitable restrictions and controls as the market established by the Market Committee would conceivably provide for them and in those circumstances when two alternative methods would equally achieve the objects the notification directing the constitution of a market to the exclusion of the existing one would be an unreasonable restriction.
Appeals dismissed.
