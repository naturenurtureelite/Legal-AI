In re Gangipati Appayya12 a view contrary to the one taken earlier by a Judge of that High Court was taken.

But section 134 lays down that after balance sheet and profit and loss account or the income and expenditure account as the case may be have been laid before the company at the general meeting three copies thereof shall be filed with the registrar and a failure to do so is made punishable under sub section 4 of that section.

The Bombay High Court pointed out in Emperor vs Pioneer Clay  In dustrial Works1 that the decision in Park vs Lawton2 is based on section 36 it is a mistake for section 26 of the English Act which in its scheme and terms is entirely different from the section with which they the Bombay High Court were concerned and that the section in the English Act is a composite one which lays down various requirements which are to be complied with by the company under its first four sub clauses and sub cl.
The appeal is dismissed.
VPS Appeal dismissed.
