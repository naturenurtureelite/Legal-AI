They are termed as daily rated employees.
In this petition under Article 32 of the Constitution they are seeking enforcement of their fundamental right to have equal pay for equal work.
They demand payment in terms paid to their counterparts in regular services.
Perhaps for the first time this Court in Randhir Singh vs Union of India  has innovated that it is a constitu tional goal capable of being achieved through constitutional remedies.
Apart from that the Court has expressly observed that the higher pay scale to avoid stagnation or resultant frustration for lack of promotional avenues may also be allowed.
But the Court held that the principle of equal pay for equal work cannot be invoked invariably in every kind of service particularly in the area of professional services.
If the classification has reasonable nexus with the objective sought to be achieved efficiency in the administration the State would be justified in prescribing different pay scales.
So long as such value judgment is made bona fide reasonably on an intelligible criterion which has a rational nexus with the object of dif ferentiation such differentiation will not amount to discrimination.
In the first place even assum ing that the petitioners  jobs are comparable with the counterparts in the government service the petitioners cannot enforce the right to equal pay for equal work.
By the general description of their job one cannot come to the conclusion that every carpenter or craftsmen is equal to the other in the performance of his work.
It requires the consideration of various dimensions of the job.
It cannot be evaluated by the mere averments in the self serving affidavits or counter affidavits of the parties.
The principal claim of the petitioners therefore fails and is rejected.
As to the claim for regularisation of services of the peti tioners 669 we express no opinion since the factual data is disputed and is insufficient.
