In Randhir Singh vs Union of India  Others I982 3 SCR 298 Chinnappa Reddy J said at 304 PG NO 300 It is true that the principle of equal pay for equal work  is not expressly declared by our Constitution to be a fundamental right.

It is now well established that the classification can be based on some qualities or characteristics of persons grouped together and not in others who are left out.
But it follows naturally that equal pay for unequal work will be a negation of that right And said The same amount of physical work may entail different quality of work some more sensitive.
