488 N N Goswamy and Arvind Minocha for the appellant.
The correctness of the date of death of Som Dass was contested by Shiam Dass.
When a suit is brought by or against a person in a representative capacity and there is a devolution of the interest of the representative the rule that has to be applied is Order 22 rule 10 and not rule 3 or 4 whether the devolution takes place as a consequence of death or for any other reason.
Order 22 rule 10 is not confined to devolution of interest of a party by death it also applies if the head of the mutt or manager of the temple resigns his office or is removed from office.
It was however contended on behalf of the respondent that there was no devolution of the interest in the subject matter of the suit on the death of Som Dass since there was no certainty as to the person who would be elected as mahant to succeed him.
In other words the suit was for possession and management of the Dera and the properties appertaining to it by the appellant purporting to be the de jure mahant against Som Dass as de facto mahant.
