It was in pursuance of this general all India policy and in particular to fulfill the feltneeds of Calcutta that the Government of West Bengal was looking out for a suitable plot in a good location.
The objections of the Managing Committee were first brought to the notice of the Minister for Metropolitan Development who submitted a note to the Chief Minister pointing out that even if four acres of land out of the eight acres of Begumbari land was given to the Taj Group there would still remain sufficient land for accommodating the existing facilities.
The Alipore Zoological Garden authorities were required to vacate the existing structure within a period of six months which was also the period stipulated for raising the new constructions.
It is not one of those cases where the evidence is first gathered and a decision is later arrived at one fine morning and the deci sion is incorporated in a reasoned order.
Like similar volumes going by whatever name pub lished by the Boards of Revenue of other States the West Bengal Land Management Manual also is compendium of 1 statutes and rules framed either by the Government or by the Board of Revenue pursuant to a statutory power conferred on them 2 Orders issued by the Government from time to time and 3 Orders circulars instructions and memoranda issued by the Board of Revenue from time to time.
There was nothing discrminatory in the procedure adopted since no other lead ing hotlier had shown any inclination to come forward.
Because of the pendency of this matter valuable time has been lost and if further time is lost the respondent No 5 may not have any further interest in the matter.
The public has also suffered.
It was faintly suggested by the Government s counsel that the first petitioner does not represent all the maz doors.
