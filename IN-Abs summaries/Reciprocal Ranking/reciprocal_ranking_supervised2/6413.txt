This was on the basis of a complaint made by the appellant that the food served in the canteen was substand ard.
On 21101975 the appellant is stated to have pressed the demand to PW 1.
The recovery of the currency notes from the appellant proves the guilty conduct of the appel lant in view of the presumption arising under section 41 of the Prevention of Corruption Act which has not been rebutted.
The High Court thought that though the conviction under section 161 IPC and section 52 of the Prevention of Corruption Act is to be maintained no separate sentence need be award ed under section 161 IPC.
The appellant has reiterated the contentions before us.
The learned counsel appearing for the appellant however maintained that the appellant had a consistent case even from the earliest opportunity that the currency notes found in his possession was the money returned by PW 1 the cir cumstances of the case would probabalise this case of the appellant and the presumption if any arising under section 4 is rebutted and the conviction cannot therefore be sus tained.

The burden resting on the accused person in such a case would not be as light as it is where a presumption is raised under section 114 of Evidence Act and cannot be held to be discharged merely by reason of the fact that the explanation offered by the accused is reasonable and probable.
The argument that clause d of section 51 of the Prevention of Corruption Act is not attracted on the proved facts is also not impressive.
