These appeals arise out of an election to a seat in the West Bengal Legislative Assembly from the Khargram Murshidabad constitutency reserved for members of the Scheduled Castes.
The contestants at this election were Abhoy Pada Saha and Sudhir Kumar Mondal.
Abhoy Pada described himself in the nomination paper as a member of the Sunri caste which is a Scheduled Caste.
The learned Judges of the High Court thought that the effect of the item was to exclude from the Sunri caste those who belonged to that caste but bore the surname Saha.
the other must be a caste.
The Tribunal came to its conclusion that Saha in the item referred to a caste distinct from the Sunri caste because the evidence before it did not show that there was within the Sunri caste a smaller caste group called Sahas.
The error of the Tribunal lay in interpreting the Order in the light of the evidence before it.
There was no justification for doing that.
For the same reason we are unable to agree with the interpretation of the High Court that the Sahas excluded were those Sunris who bore the surname Saha.
These witnesses were disbelieved by the Tribunal which described them as unreliable.
One set of hearing fees only.
