It divided the employees of the banks with which it was concerned in two groups.

292 and certain provisions were made thereunder.
This paragraph was considered by the Labour Appellate Tribunal in appeal from the Sastry award and certain modifications were made thereunder by paras 164 and 166 of the Labour Appellate Tribunal decision in appeal.
1 As the words of para 292 of the Sastry award as modified by the Labour Appellate Decision are almost the same as the words of para.
5356 of the Desai award we may set out the two paragraphs in parallel columns for comparison Sastry award as modified by the Labour Appellate decision For workmen who enterd service of the bank before 31st January 1950 1.
The workman s basic pay as on 31st January 1960 shall not be reduced in any case.
c Such increments shall not however exceed four in number.
In addition the workman will be entitled to draw his normal increment for 1953on 1st April 1963.
c Such increments shall not however exceed four in number.
in the scale provided by the Sastry award as modified will be added thereto for service for the two years of 1960 and 1961.

Giving as we must natural meaning to the words used in rules 2 and 4 we are of opinion that in no case can the basic pay be fixed at a higher figure than what the point to point adjustment would give to the workman or the maximum in the new scale.
 The dispute between the bank and the workmen in the present case was this.
Thus the bank s case was that once the maximum arrived at by point to point adjustment as on January 1 1962 was reached under cl.

But as stated by the Labour Appellate Tribunal when dealing with the Sastry award it was inherent in the Sastry award that increments for 1951 and 1952 should be provided after the basic pay was worked out as on January 31 1950.
