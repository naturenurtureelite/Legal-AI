Taneja for the Respondents.
Feeling aggrieved by the order of dismissal of the appeal the defendants preferred separate Second Appeals Nos.
Interfering with the concurrent findings recorded by the two courts below the High Court came to the conclusion that the courts below had applied the wrong test and had based their findings on the question of tenancy and dispossession on mere conjectures.
The High Court therefore held that the decree passed by the Civil Court was unsustainable.
It is against this order of the High Court that the present appeal by special leave is preferred.
Section 9 lays down the modes of termination of tenancy which are a by the tenant surrendering his right to the landlord in the manner provided in section 10 or b by the landlord terminating the tenancy on the grounds specified in section 11 or c under any other specific provision of the Act.
Sub section 2 thereof provides that save as otherwise provided in the Act no court shall have jurisdiction to settle decide or deal with any question which is by or under this Act required to be settled decided or dealt with by the Mamlatdar and no order passed by him under the Act shall be questioned in any civil or criminal court.
By virtue of section 7 any question whether a person is a tenant or a deemed tenant was required to be decided by the Mamlatdar and the jurisdiction of the Civil Court stood ousted by section 582 of the Act.
Since section 12 of the Rent Act was held to be prospective the question which arose for consideration was whether its protection could be extended to tenants in pending litigation.
Therefore the question which arose in the suit was whether defendant No1 proved that he was a tenant in respect of the land in question.
Section 851 laid down that no Civil Court shall have jurisdiction to settle decide or deal with any question which is required to be settled decided or dealt with by the Mamlatdar under the statute.
