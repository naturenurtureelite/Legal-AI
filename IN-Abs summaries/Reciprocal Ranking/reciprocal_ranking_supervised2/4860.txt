The High Court considered the evidence and dismissed Criminal Appeal 38 of 1977 filed by the State for enhancement of the sentence of imprisonment for life awarded to accused 1 and 6 for the murder of Malan as also Criminal Appeal 7 of 1977 filed by accused 1 and 6 against their conviction and the sentence awarded to them.
We are of the opinion that the retracted judicial confession of accused 5 could not be relied upon against accused 6 in this case in view of the fact that accused 6 who had been tried alongwith accused 5 had been acquitted by the High Court of the charge of conspiracy under section 302 read with section 120B IPC and accused 5 was not charged for the offence of murder of Malan for which only accused 1 6 and 7 were tried.
In these circumstances we found that there is sufficient evidence against accused 6 proving his guilt in respect of charge No 4 framed regarding the murder of Malan beyond all reasonable doubt and that he had been rightly convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for life under section 302 read with section 34 I P C Accordingly we allowed the Criminal Appeal 288 of 1980 and acquitted Prakash accused 5 and directed him to be set at liberty forthwith and dismissed Criminal Appeal 287 of 1980 filed by accused 6 and confirmed the conviction of accused 6 and the sentence awarded to him by the courts below.
