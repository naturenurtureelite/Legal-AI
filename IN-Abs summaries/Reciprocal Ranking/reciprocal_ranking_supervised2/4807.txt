JD Jain  Mrs Kawaljit Kocher for the Appellant.
On March 14 1975 a resolution was passed by respondent 3 regularising the post of Head Clerk.
On April 1 1975 the appellant was appointed as a Head Clerk.
Sections 351 of the Act empowers the State Government to place at the disposal of a Panchayat Samiti such of its servants as are required for the implementation of the schemes connected therewith and for such other duties and functions as may be assigned to them by the Panchayat Samiti from time to time.
Being aggrieved by his absorption on a lower post he filed a writ petition in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana asking that he should be absorbed as a Head Clerk.
He was therefore entitled to be absorbed in Government service as a clerk in any event.
the Panchayat.
737 It is urged by Shri Jain who appears on behalf of the appellant that by reason of section 144 of the Amending Act the appellant was entitled to continue in the service of the Panchayat on the same terms and conditions on which he was employed by the Panchayat Samiti until he was absorbed in Government service.
Clearly it had fortified that right on June 13 1973.
The appointment of the appellant to the post of a Head Clerk being without the authority of law the Government was not bound to absorb him in the post of a Head Clerk.
He was appointed lawfully to the post of a Clerk and that is the post in which the Government has absorbed him.
