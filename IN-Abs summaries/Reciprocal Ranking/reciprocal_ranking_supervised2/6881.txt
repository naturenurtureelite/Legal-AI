The right of pre emption in regard to a co sharer was upheld on the consideration that if an outsider is introduced as a co sharer in a property it will make common management extremely difficult and destroy the benefits of ownership in common.
In Atam Prakash s case this Court therefore held that what was said about the right of pre emption granted to co sharers in relation to Article 1911 of the Constitution applied with equal force to justify the classification in relation to Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution.
Accord ing to section 15 of this Act before its amendment in1960 in the case of sale of a share out of joint land or proper ty the right of preemption was conferred firstly on the lineal descendents of the vendor in order of succession secondly in the co sharers if any who are agnates in order of succession thirdly in persons not included under firstly or secondly above in order of succession who but for such sale would be entitled on death of the vendor to inherit the land or property sold and fourthly in the co sharers.
Thus the purport of Atam Prakash s case supra was that while co sharers were entitled to pre empt the confer ment of that right on certain kinsfolk based on the rule of consanguinity being a relic of the feudal past could not be tolerated.
If the preceding clauses were not erased from the statute book as unconstitu tional the kinsfolk would have exercised the right in the order of preference for which no justification was found.
VPR Appeal allowed.
