I N Shroff for respondent No 1.
On March 25 1954 he was suspended and at that time he was acting as Accountant at Rajkot Central Jail.
The Enquiry Officer made a report and on or about January 7 1955 the following notice was issued to him calling upon him to show cause why he should not be dismissed from service To Shri Bhaishanker A Joshi Accountant Rajkot Central Prison Under suspension Charges framed against you under this office No C 14 dated 27 3 54 and in particular the charges of having accepted illegal gratification from prisoner Ratilal Jivan have been established to the satisfaction of Government.
Moreover as pointed out by the High Court the Inspector General of Prisons had the report before him and the tentative conclusions arrived at by the Enquiry Officer were bound to influence him and in depriving the plaintiff of a copy of the report he was handicapped is not knowing what material was influencing the Inspector General of Prisons.
That is the only purpose of the enquiry held by competent officer and the report he makes as a result of the said enquiry.
3This section shall have effect subject to the other provisions of this Part relating to the apportionment of liabilities in respect of loans guarantees and other financial obligations and bank balances and securities shall notwithstanding that they partake of the nature of contractual rights be dealt with under those provisions.
He would claim on a quantum mersuit and I am fortified in this view by Reilly vs R 2 by R vs Doultre4 and by Bushe vs R5 referred to in Robertson s book at p 338 11956 1 All ER 807 811 12.

4 5 May 29 We are here concerned with a choice between section 60 and section 61 which lay down two broad categories.
It seems to us that the decree of the High Court decreeing payment of arrears of salary is truly a liability in proceedings relating to a contract within section 602a of the Act.
