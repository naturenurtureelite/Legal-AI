il Appeal No18 of 1955.
November 13.
On the other hand the High Court indicated that it was inclined to accept the plea raised by respondent 1 that Lakshmamma had transferred all her interest in the properties comprised in the said deed of gift in favour of her husband Sadagopalachar and since in its opinion  Lakshmamms at no time appears to have claimed that she had any interest in those properties there was considerable force in the argument urged by respondent 1 that LakShmamma must have relinquished her interest in the said properties and waived her rights in favour of her husband .
In pursuance of this certificate the High Court ordered that the appeal to this Court should be admitted and so this appeal has come to this Court.
A 1 to A 5.
The appellant has stated that the will was written in one room and Lakshmamma was lying in the adjoining room and it was after the will was written that the scribe went into the adjoining room and read the will to her so that the statement of the scribe that the will was written in the presence of Lakshmamma is not supported by the appellant.
He was not present when the will was written.
It would sound platitudinous to say so but it is nevertheless true that in discovering truth even in such cases the judicial mind must always be open though vigilant cautious and circumspect.
