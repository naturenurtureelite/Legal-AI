It was suggest.
said that there was no substantial difference in the procedure prescribed under section 34 of the Indian Income tax Act and the impugned Act and that in any case the procedure prescribed by the Act was a good substitute for that prescribed by the Indian Income tax Act.
It is not possible to hold that all such persons who evade payment of income tax and do not truly disclose all particulars or material facts necessary for their assessment and against whom a report is made under sub section 4 of section 5 of the impugned Act by themselves form a class distinct from those who evade payment of income tax and come within the ambit of section 34 of the Indian Income tax Act.
The State can by classification determine who should be regarded as a class for purposes of legislation and in relation to a law enacted on a particular subject but the classification permissible must be based on some real and substantial distinction bearing a just and reasonable relation  to the objects sought to be attained and cannot be made arbitrarily and without any substantial basis.
We thus hold that both section 34 of the Indian Income tax Act and sub section 4 of 462 section 5 of the impugned Act deal with all persons who have similar characteristics and similar properties the common characteristics being that they are persons who have not truly disclosed their income and have evaded payment of taxation on income.
