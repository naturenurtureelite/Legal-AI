The plaintiff therefore contended that defendant No 1 was a trespasser in the property and was liable to be evicted therefrom.
2788 and 3188 which came to be allowed on April 5 1991.
On these findings the High Court allowed the appeals and 1021 reversed the decree of the Trial Court with no order as to costs.

It was only thereafter that the plaintiff filed the suit for restoration of his possession.
The lite is also the same.
Even in cases of threatened wrongful possession section 8A says that any tenant in possession of any land or dwelling house who apprehends that he may be dispossessed contrary to the provisions of this Act may apply in the prescribed manner to the Mamlatdar for an order safeguarding his right to possession.
The jurisdiction is therefore vested in the Mamlatdar under section 7 of the Act and section 582 specifically bars the jurisdiction of all other courts to settle decide or deal with any question which is by or under the Act required to be settled decided or dealt with by the Mamlatdar.
We are therefore of the opinion that it would be just and fair that the issue whether defendant No1 was a tenant in respect of the lands in question should be referred to the Mamlatdar for decision and after his decision is received by the Civil Court if the issue is held against defendant No1 the Civil Court may consider passing of a decree in eviction but if on the other hand he is held to be tenant the Civil Court may be required to dismiss the suit.
We would like to make it clear that the hypothetical situations may or may not apply to the fact situation that may emanate of the pleadings in this case and it would be for the Trial Court to determine the course of action to be adopted in the light of the guidelines indicated hereinabove.
