N Criminal Appeal Nos.
781 VS Desai Mrs J Wad and Miss Aruna Mathur for the Appellants.
OP Rana K V Sree Kumar and MN Shroff for the Respondent.
After hearing the learned counsel for the parties we allowed the appeal of Prakash accused 5 and acquitted him and set aside his conviction and the sentence awarded to him.
So far as Vinayak accused 6 is concerned we dismissed his appeal on 1391984 for reason to follow.
Now proceed to record our reasons.
Accused 5 and 6 only have filed Criminal Appeal 288 of 1980 and Criminal Appeal 287 of 1980 respectively against the conviction of accused 5 and the sentence of imprisonment for life awarded by the High Court under section 302 read with section 120B IPC and the confirmation of the conviction and sentence awarded to accused 6 by the trial court under section 302 read with section 34 IPC respectively.
We were therefore not called upon to consider any such question.
We are of the opinion that the retracted judicial confession of accused 5 could not be relied upon against accused 6 in this case in view of the fact that accused 6 who had been tried alongwith accused 5 had been acquitted by the High Court of the charge of conspiracy under section 302 read with section 120B IPC and accused 5 was not charged for the offence of murder of Malan for which only accused 1 6 and 7 were tried.
