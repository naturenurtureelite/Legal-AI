Civil Appeal No 159 of 1974.
From the Judgment and Order dated 4 4 1973 of the Punjab and Haryana High Court at Chandigarh in RSA No 1482 of 1961.
488 N N Goswamy and Arvind Minocha for the appellant.
Kapil Sibbal and D Probir Mitra for respondents.
Against that decree an appeal was preferred by the appellant to the High Court.
An application was made on 1 2 1971 by the appellant stating that Som Dass died on 26 11 1970 leaving behind him Shiam Dass as his Chela and for impleading him.
 This rule is based on the principle that trial of a suit cannot be brought to an end merely because the interest of a party in the subject matter of the suit has devolved upon another during the pendency of the suit but that suit may be continued against the person acquiring the interest with the leave of the Court.
And as it was in a representative capacity that Som Dass was sued and as it was in the same representative capacity that the appeal was sought to be continued against Shiam Dass Order 22 rule 10 will apply1.
