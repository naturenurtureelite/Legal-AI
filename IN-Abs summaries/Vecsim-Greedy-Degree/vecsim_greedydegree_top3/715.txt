From this it was submitted that as 14 days had expired before March 18 1952 the dismissal could not be said to be one within the words  pendency of conciliation proceedings .
The Act provides for commencement and conclusion of conciliation proceedings under section 20 but the first sub section of section 20 deals with what are called utility services and sub section 2 of that section provides as to when the conciliation proceedings conclude.
All conciliation proceedings under this sub section shall be deemed to have concluded in the case where no settlement is reached when the report of the Conciliation Officer is received by the appropriate Government.
It was contended that the conciliation proceedings should be held to terminate when the Conciliation Officer is required under section 126 of the Act to submit his report but the provisions of the Act above quoted do not support this contention as the termination of the conciliation proceedings is deemed to take place when the report is received by the appropriate Government.
It was next contended that on this interpretation the conciliation proceedings could be prolonged much beyond what was contemplated by the Act and the termination would depend upon how soon a report is received by the appropriate Government.
The appeal is therefore dismissed.
