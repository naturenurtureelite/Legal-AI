any other law for the time being in force.
On January 21 1974 he was promoted as a Head Clerk on an ad hoc basis.
On April 1 1975 the appellant was appointed as a Head Clerk.
Section 13 of the Amending Act deleted section 33 of the Act.
A plain consequence of this deletion was that the Panchayat Samitis were divested of their power to make appointments to the Panchayats.
Sections 351 of the Act empowers the State Government to place at the disposal of a Panchayat Samiti such of its servants as are required for the implementation of the schemes connected therewith and for such other duties and functions as may be assigned to them by the Panchayat Samiti from time to time.
Sub section 4 of section 14 of the Amending Act provides that persons employed by a Panchayat Samiti before April 1 1973 and who were in service at the commencement of the Amending Act shall continue to service on the same terms and conditions on which they were employed by the Panchayat Samiti until they are absorbed in the Government service or retire in such manner as may be prescribed.
Being aggrieved by his absorption on a lower post he filed a writ petition in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana asking that he should be absorbed as a Head Clerk.
The writ petition having been dismissed by the High Court the appellant has filed this appeal by special leave.
