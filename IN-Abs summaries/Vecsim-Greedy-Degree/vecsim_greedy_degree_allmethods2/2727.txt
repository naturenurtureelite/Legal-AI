According to the appellant the temple was rounded two hundred years ago by the members of his community and since then the management of the temple and is affairs was always vested in the community of the Sengunatha Mudaliars and no person other than the elected trustee had at any time the right of management and control of the temple.
9 of Madras Act 19 of 1951 states In this Act unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context 9 hereditary trustee  means the trustee of a religious institution succession to whose office devolves by hereditary right or is regulated by usage or is specifically provided for by the founder so long as such scheme of succession is in force This Act has been substituted by Madras Act 22 of 1959 but the definition of the trustee is identical in both the Acts.

Hereditary succession is succession by the heir to the deceased under the law the office must be transmitted to the successor according to some definite rules of descent which by their own force designate the person to succeed.
But the election to the office of trustee in the present case is for a fixed period of one year and not for life.
In Black s Law Dictionary the word succession  is defined as follows The revolution of title to property under the law of descent and distribution.
1 428 The right by which one set of men may by succeeding another set acquire a property in all the goods movables and other chattels of a corporation.
For these reasons we hold that this appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs.
