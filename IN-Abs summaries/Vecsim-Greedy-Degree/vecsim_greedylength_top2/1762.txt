The suit out of which appeal No 887 has arisen was filed by the respondent against the State of Rajasthan.
By May 15 1949 the United State of Rajasthan was formed including the Matsya Union into which the former State of Dholpur had merged on March 17 1948.
Provision was also made in the Covenant that all the assets and liabilities of the covenanting States shall be the assets and liabilities of the new State of Matsya.
The three second appeals were dismissed by the High Court.
In consequence this Court further held that the Covenant by which the new State of Pepsu came into existence was in its entirety an act of State and that article VI therein could not operate to confer any right on the company as against the new State for the principle was well settled that clauses in treaties entered into by sovereigns of independent States whereunder sovereignty in territories passed from one to the other providing for the recognition by the new sovereign of the existing rights of the residents of those territories must be regarded as invested with the character of an act of State and no claim based thereon could be enforced in a court of law.
But this was of course subject to any law made by the new State repealing the old laws and the liabilities arising there under or even otherwise provided the law so made was within the competence of the new State and after the Constitution came into force it did not transgress the constitutional limitations.
