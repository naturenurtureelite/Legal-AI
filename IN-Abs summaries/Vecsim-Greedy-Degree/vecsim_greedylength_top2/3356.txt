The High Court acquitted accused Jabamani Nadar alias Kanyakumari Comrade alias Ramu and accepted the reference in respect of the present accused.
PM I woke up on hearing a noise to the effect younger brother Karunakaran is running after stabbing me with knife catch him .
It was also observed that the High Court can place no reliance on the testimony of PW 4 in so far as he implicated the second accused and Tharnizharasan in the case of murder of Viswanatham.
This may not in a given case be considered as a very serious infirmity since the witness may not have seen the other.
assailants when he came running to the place of occurrence.
But the fact that the witness has stated in the first information report that the deceased was only mentioning the name of accused Karunakaran as his assailant this earlier version appears to be contradicted by the medical evidence.
Besides he has deliberately changed his own stand in court when he deposed that he saw two other persons running ahead of Karunakaran being chased by his two brothers and Ramaswamy.
On the other hand we find that there is a mention about a pool of blood only where the dead body was found at No 1 in the site plan.
We further find from the evidence of PW 4 in cross examination that when he went near his deceased elder brother about hundred persons were there and none of them asked him as to how it had happened.
It also stands to reason that those persons who gathered would not ask PW 4 who arrived at the place a little later for information with regard to the assailants.
The High Court is not even right that PW 4 stands wholly corroborated by the contents of the FIR.
SR Appeal allowed.
