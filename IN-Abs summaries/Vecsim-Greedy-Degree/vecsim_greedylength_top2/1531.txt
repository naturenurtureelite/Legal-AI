Against that order an appeal was taken to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and then to the Appellate Tribunal.
The question before us is whether the income which was received subsequent to the previous year in which Amarchand died is liable to be assessed to income tax under section 24B as his income in the hands of his heirs and legal representatives.
In the present case the accounts were kept on cash basis.
It was held that this income was taxable.
See Ellis C Reid vs Commissioner of Income tax Bombay2.
It was held that no assessment could be made under section 234 of the Act after his death.
710 of the deceased Amarchand and are not liable to be taxed in the hands of the heirs and legal representatives who cannot be deemed to be assessees for the purpose of assessment in regard to those years.
In our view the High Court rightly answered the question in the negative and against the Commissioner of Income tax.
The appeals therefore fail and are dismissed with costs.
