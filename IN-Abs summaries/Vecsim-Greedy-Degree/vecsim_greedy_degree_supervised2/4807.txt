The writ petition having been dismissed by the High Court the appellant has filed this appeal by special leave.
He was therefore entitled to be absorbed in Government service as a clerk in any event.
The fact that the appellant was promoted as a Head Clerk on an ad hoc basis in January 1974 or the further fact that he was appointed as a Head Clerk on April 1 1975 cannot improve his position for the simple reason that these appointments were made after June 13 1973 being the date on which the Panchayat Samiti lost its power to make appointments to.
the Panchayat.
Since the appellant according to the terms and conditions of his service with the Panchayat was entitled to be considered for promotion to the post of a Head Clerk his appointment as a Head Clerk prior to his absorption in Government service had to be recognised and protected despite the fact that such appointment was made after June 13 1973 when the Amending Act came into force.
Clearly it had fortified that right on June 13 1973.
The appointment of the appellant to the post of a Head Clerk being without the authority of law the Government was not bound to absorb him in the post of a Head Clerk.
He was appointed lawfully to the post of a Clerk and that is the post in which the Government has absorbed him.
There will be no order as to costs.
SR Appeal dismissed.
