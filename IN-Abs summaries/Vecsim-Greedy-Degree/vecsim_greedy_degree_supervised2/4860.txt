287  288 of 1980 Appeals by Special leave from the judgment and Order dated the 27th July  8th August 1979 of the Bombay High Court in Crl.
Appeal Nos 7 of 1977 and 605 of 1978.
781 VS Desai Mrs J Wad and Miss Aruna Mathur for the Appellants.
Charge No 2 framed against accused 1 to 3 was under section 302 read with section 34 IPC.
The High Court considered the evidence and dismissed Criminal Appeal 38 of 1977 filed by the State for enhancement of the sentence of imprisonment for life awarded to accused 1 and 6 for the murder of Malan as also Criminal Appeal 7 of 1977 filed by accused 1 and 6 against their conviction and the sentence awarded to them.
As regards accused 6 in the High Court reliance was placed by the prosecution on four pieces of evidence besides the evidence of the approver PW 1 and the retracted confession of accused 5.
We are of the opinion that the retracted judicial confession of accused 5 could not be relied upon against accused 6 in this case in view of the fact that accused 6 who had been tried alongwith accused 5 had been acquitted by the High Court of the charge of conspiracy under section 302 read with section 120B IPC and accused 5 was not charged for the offence of murder of Malan for which only accused 1 6 and 7 were tried.
