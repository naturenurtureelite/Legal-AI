Appeal No 251 of 1963.
Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated March 20 1957 of the Patna High Court in Civil Revision No 40 of 1956.
March 24 1964.
 10  per day and that led to the present claim made by the respondents under section 15 of the Act.
421 The authority has found that section 2vi includes wages prescribed by the Industrial Tribunal and so it has rejected the appellants  contention that the applications made by the respondents were incompetent under section 15 of the Act.
In a sense the latter wage structure must be deemed to be a contract between the parties because that in substance is the effect of industrial adjudication.
In Jogendra Nath 1 AIR 1964 SC 15.
423 Chatterjee and Sons vs Chandreswar Singh1 the Calcutta High Court appears to have taken the view which supports Mr Setalvad s argument whereas in the Modern Mills Ltd vs V R Mangalvedhkar2 and in V B Godse Manager Prabha Mills Ltd vs R M Naick Inspector under the Payment of Wages Act3 the Bombay High Court has interpreted section 2vi to include wages directed to be paid by industrial adjudication.
Appeal dismissed 1 AIR 1951 Cal 29.
2 AIR 1930 Bom.
