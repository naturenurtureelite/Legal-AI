14 Section 69d of the Act of 1973 must accordingly be read to mean that respondent 1 shall have all the powers of taxation which a Municipal Corporation or a Municipal Council has for the time being that is to say at the time when respondent 1 seeks to exercise those powers.
 In Heavy Engineering Mazdoor Union vs The State of Bihar  Ors the Heavy Engineering Corporation Limited was incorporated under the and its entire share capital was contributed by the Central Government.
Under section 51 of the Coal Mines Nationalisation Act 26 of 1973 which applies in the instant case the right title and interest of a nationalised coal mine vest by direction of the Central Government in the Government company.
Basing himself on that consideration the Attorney General argues 1 By virtue of the declaration contained in section 2 of Mines and Minerals Development and Regulation Act 1957 the legislative field covered by Entry 23 19 List II passed on the Parliament by virtue of Entry 54 List I 2 The Parliament enacted the Coal Mines Nationalisation Act 1973 for acquisition of coal mines with a view to reorganising and reconstructing such coal mines so as to ensure the rational coordinated and scientific development and utilisation of coal resources as best to subserve the common good.
Apart from the fact that there is no data before us showing that the property tax constitutes an impediment in the achievement of the goals of the Coal Mines Nationalisation Act the provisions of the MP Act of 1973 under which Special Areas and Special Area Development Authorities are constituted afford an effective answer to the Attorney General s contention.
Entry 54 of List I relates to Regulation of mines and mineral development to the extent to which such regulation and development under the control of the Union is declared by Parliament by law to be expedient in the public interest.
Section 68 defines the functions of the Special Area Development Authority one of which as prescribed by clause v is to provide the municipal services as specified in sections 123 and 124 of the Madhya Pradesh Municipalities Act 1961.
It was further held by the Court that the land cess was not a tax on mineral rights but was in truth and substance a tax on lands within the meaning of Entry 49 of the State List.
The power conferred by the State Legislature on Special Area Development Authorities to impose the property tax on lands and buildings is therefore not in conflict with the power conferred by the Coal Mines Nationalisation Act on the Union Government to regulate and develop the Coal mines so as to ensure rational and scientific utilisation of coal resources.
The paramount purpose behind the declaration contained in section 2 of the Mines and Minerals Regulation and Develop 22 ment Act 1957 is not in any manner defeated by the legitimate exercise of taxing power under section 69d of the Act of 1973.
That the declaration in section 2 of the does not result in invalidation of every State legislation relating to mines and minerals is demonstrated effectively by the decision in State of Haryana  Anr.
It was contended on behalf of 23 the sugar undertakings that since sugar is a declared industry under the Industries Development and Regulation Act 1951 Parliament alone was competent to pass a law on the subject and the State Legislature had no competence to pass the impugned Act by reason of Entry 52 List I read with Entry 24 List II.
NVK Appeals dismissed.
