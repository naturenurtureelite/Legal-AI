Civil Appeals Nos 2299 and 2300 of 1979.
170 The Union filed a statement before the Tribunal claiming an upward revision of the wage scales and dearness allowance and an increase from fifteen years to twenty years in the span for earning annual increments.
171 in this connection it proceeded on the footing that the appellant was a separate and independent division of Tata Sons Limited and had no functional integrality with the other divisions.

173 Two days after the award was made an application was made by the Union stating In the said award your Honour has observed at the end of para 22 In view of the increase that is being allowed in the basic pay I do not propose to revise the existing scheme of Dearness Allowance.
And that is confirmed by what was stated in paragraph 23 of the award Considering this outgoing the flat increase of Rs 150 in the category of Draughtsman and Rs 100 in the case of the other categories would be fair.
No second flat increase was envisaged at all.
The amendment made by the Tribunal has the effect of providing a second increase this time to each individual workmen.
Again if the flat increase is Rs 65 per month to the individual workmen of all categories the additional load would total Rs 497772 .
The statement afforded an indication merely of what the additional financial load would be if a flat increase was given to the individual workman on the alternative basis set forth therein.
None of the alternatives was actually adopted by the Tribunal because when the award was made the Tribunal proceeded instead to restructure the wage scales by the addition of Rs 150 in the case of the category of Draughtsmen and Rs 100 in the case of other categories to the initial pay in the wage scales pertaining to those categories.
The only contention of the workmen is that the Tribunal should have fixed the dearness allowance in communion with the cost of living index.
Accordingly the appeal filed by the workmen must fail.
Civil Appeal No 2300 of 1979 is dismissed.
CHINNAPPA REDDY J We have had the advantage of perusing the judgment prepared by our learned brother Pathak J we agree with 180 him that Civil Appeal No 2300 of 1979 should be dismissed.
In the said award Your Honour has observed at the end of Para 22 In view of the increase that is being allowed in the basic pay I do not propose to revise the existing scheme of Dearness Allowance .
Even so we propose to examine whether the correction sought by the employees union was within the bounds of the authority of the Tribunal or whether it was in effect a fresh award.
Implicit and intrinsically connected with the question of revision of the wage scales were the questions of fitment of employees into the wage scales and flat or ad hoc increase of salaries of workmen wherever considered necessary.
For some years to come this is likely to be one of the few Consulting Engineers who will be securing major contracts.
After fixing the salary of the employees in the scales as above the employees should be given increments in the new scales as noted below i Employees who have completed 5 years or more as on 1st January 1976 3 increments.
iii All other employees with more than one year s service shall be given one increment.
While workmen raising industrial disputes for revision of wage scales are certainly minded about their future prospects in the matter of wages they surely would be more concerned with the immediate benefits according to them That was why the Industrial Tribunal thought that an all round flat increase of Rs 150 in the case of Draftsmen and Rs 100 in the case of other workmen was called for.
Since there was to be a flat increase of Rs 150 and Rs 100 in the case of draftsmen and other workmen respectively the revised wage scale had necessarily to commence with figures Rs 150 and Rs 100 above the existing wage scales.
As it has now turned out what the employees apparently suspected the employer might contend is precisely what the employer is not contending though the employer did not choose to so contend before the Industrial Tribunal itself when the employees filed the application for rectification.
