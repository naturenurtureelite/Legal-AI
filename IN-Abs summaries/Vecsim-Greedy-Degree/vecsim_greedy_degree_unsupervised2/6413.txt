AS Nambiar and KR Nambiar for the Appellant.
PW 3 the Principal of the training school issued exhibit P 2 show cause notice to the PW 1 Venkataswamy the canteen contractor as to why his licence for running the canteen should not be cancelled.
This was on the basis of a complaint made by the appellant that the food served in the canteen was substand ard.
As instructed PW 1 was ready with ten rupees currency notes.
When PW 1 emerged PW 6 along with PW 2 confronted the appellant.
The appellant produced the currency notes.
PW 6 conducted the phenolphthalein test with reference to the fingers of the appellant.
The test was positive the currency notes were seized and the appellant arrested.
PW 3 the Principal produced the concerned file relating to show cause notice from the house of the appellant on the same day.
Finally the appellant was chargesheeted.
At the trial the prosecution witnesses supported the case.
PW 1 affirmed the fact that the appellant made the demand and had also received the amount on 2210.
The recovery of the currency notes from the appellant was not challenged.
The plea of the appellant was that PW 1 had returned the amount due to him and there had been no demand for a bribe as there had been no occasion for doing so.
The Trial Court accepted the prosecution evidence rejected the plea of the appellant and recorded the conviction.
It cannot therefore be said that there had been consistent explanation for the appellant.
He had thereafter received the amount of Rs 100 from PW 1.
A fact is said to be proved when its existence is directly established or when upon the material before it the Court finds its existence to be so probable that a reasonable man would act on the supposition that it exists.
