Meanwhile it appeared that the Public Undertakings Committee appointed by the West Bengal Legislative Assembly submitted a port on February 14 1981 about the zoo in which they stated.
It was suggested that the Government may consider abandoning the proposal to set up a hotel on the Eastern side of the Zoo.
On June 9 1981 the Secretary of the Animal Husbandary and Veterinary Services Department complained to the Secre tary of the Metropolitan Development Department that they were not aware of the decision to lease the Begambari land.
He added that the Managing Committee s resolution was not binding on the Government and suggested that the Director of the Zoo might be asked to allow the Taj Group to undertake soil testing etc.
I agree.
In view of the letter issued to the Zoologi cal Gardens Alipore and the Cabinet decision regarding the land of Begumbari Compound and in consideration of the assurance conveyed through Shri Ashoka Bose Chief Whip and Member that the State Government will give to the Garden adjacent lands and matching grants for the purposes of shifting of the Depart ments of the Zoo within the said compound the members do not press their objections as contained in the resolution of the Managing Committee held on 11681.
