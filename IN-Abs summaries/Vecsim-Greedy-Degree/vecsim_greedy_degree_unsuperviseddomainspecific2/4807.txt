JD Jain  Mrs Kawaljit Kocher for the Appellant.
He was confirmed in that post in course of time.
On January 21 1974 he was promoted as a Head Clerk on an ad hoc basis.
On April 1 1975 the appellant was appointed as a Head Clerk.
A plain consequence of this deletion was that the Panchayat Samitis were divested of their power to make appointments to the Panchayats.
Sections 351 of the Act empowers the State Government to place at the disposal of a Panchayat Samiti such of its servants as are required for the implementation of the schemes connected therewith and for such other duties and functions as may be assigned to them by the Panchayat Samiti from time to time.
Acting in pursuance of the provision of section 144 of the Amending Act the Government of Haryana notified the absorption of the appellant as a clerk though as stated earlier he was working as a head Clerk in the Loharu Panchayat Samiti.
Being aggrieved by his absorption on a lower post he filed a writ petition in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana asking that he should be absorbed as a Head Clerk.
737 It is urged by Shri Jain who appears on behalf of the appellant that by reason of section 144 of the Amending Act the appellant was entitled to continue in the service of the Panchayat on the same terms and conditions on which he was employed by the Panchayat Samiti until he was absorbed in Government service.
