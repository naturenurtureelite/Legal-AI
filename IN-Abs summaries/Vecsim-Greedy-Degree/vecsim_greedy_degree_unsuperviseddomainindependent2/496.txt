Each was convicted and each was 1085 sentenced to death under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code.
On the question of sentence he considered that the death sentences on the three appellants Pandurang Tukia and Bhilia should be maintained and that those of the other two should be commuted to transportation for life.
All five convicts then applied to the High Court for leave to appeal.
The prosecution case is this.
On 7 12 1950 about 3 o clock in the afternoon Ramchander Shelke the deceased went to his field known as Bhavara with his wife s sister Rasika Bai PW1 and his servant Subhana Rao PW7.
Anyway Rasika Bai heard shouts from that direction so she ran to the river bank with Subhana and they both say that they saw all five accused attacking Ramchander with axes and sticks.
It is said that there is some discrepancy between Rasika Bai s statement in the Sessions Court and in the Committal Court about the order in which the blows were given and their number.
In that he is not right though the mistake is natural enough because exhibit 4 merely places Tukaram s name opposite the printed column headed complainant or informant.
But what the learned counsel for the appellants says is that he saw Narsabai on the evening of the murder and as she did not give him any names it is evident that no one knew who the assailants were and that therefore the accusation made against the accused was a subsequent concoction and that it was for that reason that they waited till the next morning before reporting the matter to the police.
He also admits that he saw Narsabai there but says he did not speak to her.
It did not reach the Police Station till 10 AM the next day though it was written about sunset the evening before but as we do not know who took it and why he delayed it is idle to speculate.
In the present case there is no evidence of any prior meeting.
