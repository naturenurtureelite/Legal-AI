The appellant brought the suit on the allegation that there was one Shiromani Nirankari Dera at Patiala that this institution had two branches one at Landeke in Moga Tehsil and the other at Nanga Kheri in the erstwhile Patiala State and that he as mahant in charge of the Shiromani Dera at Patiala had the right to manage the properties attached to the Dera at Landeke.
While the appeal was pending in the High Court Som Dass the defendant died on 13 10 1970.
The High Court found no substance in the plea that the appellant had no knowledge about the date of the death of Som Dass and held that the appeal had abated and that there was no ground for setting aside the abatement.
The High Court held that after the death of Som Dass Shiam Dass as his Chela inherited the sum total of the rights which earlier vested in Som Dass and when a controversy is raised about such rights then the appellant was bound to bring on record the legal representatives of the deceased within the time prescribed by law.
