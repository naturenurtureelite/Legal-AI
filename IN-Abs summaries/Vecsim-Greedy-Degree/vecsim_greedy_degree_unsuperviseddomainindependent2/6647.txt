Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India.
The Judgement of the Court was delivered by SC AGRAWAL J These petitions under Article 32 of the Constitution raise a common question as to the validity of sub para 10 of para 218 of the Import  Export Policy for the period April 1988 to March 1991.
236 The petitioners in both these writ petitions are partnership firms carrying on business of import of rough diamonds and export of cut and polished diamonds.
The Import  Export Policy for the period April 1978 to March 1979 in para 174 made provision for grant of certain import facilities to Export Houses which were registered in accordance with the provisions of the said Policy.
The petitioners submitted application for registration as Export Houses and for grant of Export House Certificate which would have entitled them to the grant of such Additional licence.
The said applications of the petitioners were rejected by the authorities on the view that petitioners had failed to diversify their export of Other Products during the year 1977 78.
The said order refusing the Export Certificate was challenged by the petitioners by filing writ petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution before the Bombay High Court.
In that order this Court laid down the following conditioned Save and except items which are specifically banned under the prevalent import policy at the time of import the respondents shall be entitled to import all other items whether canalised or otherwise in accordance with the relevant rules.
The writ petition and the appeal were decided by the Bombay High Court in accordance with the aforesaid decision of this Court in the case of Union of India vs Rajnikant Brothers supra and the High Court directed the authorities to grant Export House Certificates to the petitioners under the Import Policy 1978 79 within three months.
While giving the said direction the High Court imposed a condition in 237 the same terms as laid down by this Court in its order dated April 18 1985 referred to above.
While construing the aforesaid direction contained in its order dated April 18 1985 in Rajnikant Brothers case supra this Court has held that the grantees of the Additional licences were not only prohibited from importing items which were excluded under the Export Policy 1978 79 but also from importing items excluded under the Import Policy prevailing at the time of import and that the word banned was intended to take in terms which were banned altogether as well as items which were banned for import by the holder of an Additional licence.
See Raj Prakash Chemicals Ltd  Anr.
vs Union of India  Ors.
The matter was further clarified by this Court in DNavinchandra  Co Bombay  Anr.
vs Union of India  Ors.
   wherein this Court has observed Analysing the said order it is apparent 1 that the importation that was permissible was of goods which were not specifically banned 2 such banning must be under the prevalent import policy at the time of import and 3 whether items which were canalised or uncanalised would be imported in accordance with the relevant rules.
These conditions had to be fulfilled.
The Court never did and could not have said that canalised items could be imported in any manner not permitted nor it could have given a go bye to canalisation policy.
Similarly the petitioners in 238 writ petition No 460 of 1988 herein were granted the Export House Certificate and an Additional licence dated August 31 1987.
xxx It appears that the petitioners were not able to make imports under the said Additional licences till March 31 1988.
With effect from April 1 1988 the Government of India issued the revised Import  Export Policy for the period April 1988 to March 1991.
The Import  Export Policy 1988 1991 also contains in para 214 and 215 provisions for grant of Additional licences to Export Houses.
In para 215 of the said Policy certain additional facilities have been given in the matter of imports by Export Houses under Additional licences issued to them.
In para 217 it is prescribed that Export Trading House Certificates issued prior to April 1 1988 would continue to be valid till the date of the expiry and the Export House Trading House can apply for fresh certificates if they fulfil the eligibility conditions laid down in the policy and in cases where these Certificates are expiring on 31st March 1988 and the applicants do not fulfil the eligibility conditions for recognition laid down under the revised Policy recognition would be granted for one year only if they fulfil conditions for renewal of these Certificates as laid down in the Import Policy 1985 88.
1 Where the applications from Export HousesTrading Houses for Additional licences have not been disposed of by 31st March of the proceeding licensing year the rate of entitlement will be the same as permissible during the licensing year to which the application pertains but the items to be allowed will be as per the Import Policy in force on the date of issue of the licence.
3 The Additional licences issued prior to 141988 240 shall cease to be valid for import of items of raw materials components and spares which appeared in Parts I and II of List 8 Appendix 6 of Import Export Policy 1985 88 but are not now covered by Part I of List 8 Appendix 6 of this Policy.
These licences will also cease to be valid for the import of items of capital goods which appeared in Appendix 1 Part B of Import Export Policy 1985 88 but are now covered by Appendix 1 Part B of this Policy.
4 The Additional licences issued to Trading Houses prior to 141988 will cease to the valid for the import of items which appeared in Appendices 3 and 5 Part A of the Import Export Policy 1985 88 but do not appear in Appendices 3 and 5 Part A of this Policy.
5 Additional licences issued to Export HousesTrading Houses prior to 141988 shall cease to be valid for import of items of spares appearing in Appendices 23 5 Part A 8 and 10 of this Policy.
6 Notwithstanding the provisions contained in sub paras 3 4 and 5 above the restrictions will not apply to the extent the licence holders have already made firm commitments by irrevocable Letters of Credit opened and established through authorised dealers in foreign exchange before 1st April 1988 but any extension of these letters of credit made after 31st March 1988 shall be treated as fresh commitments .
7 Additional licences issued to Export HousesTrading Houses prior to 141988 will also be valid within their overall value for import of raw materials components consumables and spares appearing in Appendix 6 List 8 Part A of this Policy.
Similarly such licences will also be valid for import of items of capital goods now covered by Appendix 1 Part B of this Policy within their overall value.
241 9 Additional licences issued to Export HousesTrading Houses after 141988 on exports made during 1986 87 or earlier periods will be non transferable .
These licences will be valid for import of the items appearing in Part I of List 8 Appendix 6 of this Policy.
The grievance of the petitioners is confined to sub para 10 of para 218 which lays down that Additional licences issued to Export HousesTrading Houses prior to April 1 1988 or issued after April 1 1988 on exports made during 1986 87 or earlier periods will not be eligible for the flexibilities in the import of items of raw materials components and consumables covered by Appendices 3 and Part A and items of non OGL capital goods other than those covered by Appendices 1 Part A 8 available under the revised Policy.
On behalf of the respondents it has been submitted by the learned Additional Solicitor General that there is no similarity between the petitioners who have been granted Additional licences on the basis of their exports made during the period 1977 78 in accordance with the Import Policy 1978 79 and the Export Houses who would be granted Additional licences on or after April 1 1988 under the Import  Export Policy 1988 91 inasmuch as the conditions of eligibility for grant of such licences and the value of licences under the Import  Export Policy 1978 79 were quite different from those contained in the Import  Export Policy 1988 91.
Under the Import  Export Policy 1978 79 there were two requirements for grant of Additional license one was the condition as to eligibility for registration as an Export House and grant of Export House Certificates and the other was the basis for issuing the Additional licences to Export House which had been granted Export House Certificates.
In para 176 of the said Policy it was laid down that the value of the Additional licences to be granted for 1978 79 would be calculated at one third of the fob value of the export of select products made in 1977 78 and manufactured by the small scale and cottage industries 244 plus 5 of the fob value of other exports of select products made in the same year.
The said 10 value can be 245 increased to 12 in cases where the Export House is able to achieve a minimum growth of 10 in terms of realisation in the previous year over the above the year preceding the same.
Shri HN Salve has however urged that in view of the decision of this Court in D Navinchandra  Co case supra the Export Houses who were granted Additional licences under the Import  Export Policy 1978 79 have to be treated at par with Export Houses who have been granted Additional licences under the Import  Export Policy for the subsequent years and since there has been relaxation in the matter of policy of canalisation of imports under sub para 4 of 246 para 215 in respect of Additional licences granted to Export Houses under the Import  Export Policy 1988 91 the petitioners are also entitled to a similar relaxation.
it was found and it is common ground now that was wrong.
We are of the opinion that this Court did not say that canalisation could be ignored.
That was not the issue.
 These observations only indicate that import of the canalised items under Additional licences issued to Export Houses like the petitioners would be permissible if the import policy prevailing at the time of import permits them to import such items.
Ltd wherein it is stated that this licence is valid for import of items as per para 215 of Import  Export Policy 1988 91 subject to restrictionsconditions laid down therein.
In view of the fact that the licence issued in favour of Ms Suraj Diamonds Industries was issued under a mistake and the said mistake has been rectified it cannot be said that the petitioners have been subjected to hostile discrimination vis a vis other Export House similarly situate.
The goods were not cleared by the customs authorities and the Collector of Customs imposed penalty and passed orders for confiscation of the goods and permitted the appellants to take delivery of good on payment of redemption fine.
As a result of the aforesaid discussion it must be held that the petitioners have failed to make out a case for interference by this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution.
Subject to the aforesaid observations the writ petitions are dismissed.
