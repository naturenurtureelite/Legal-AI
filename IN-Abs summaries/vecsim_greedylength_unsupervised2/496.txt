In Criminal Appeals Nos 92 and 93 of 1954.
December 3.
Five persons including the three appellants were prosecuted for the murder of one Ram chander Shelke.
Each was convicted and each was 1085 sentenced to death under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code.
They differed.
All five convicts then applied to the High Court for leave to appeal.
Anyway Rasika Bai heard shouts from that direction so she ran to the river bank with Subhana and they both say that they saw all five accused attacking Ramchander with axes and sticks.
He is Mahadappa PW 9.
He also admits that he saw Narsabai there but says he did not speak to her.
Accordingly there must have been a prior meeting of minds.
At bottom it is a question of fact in every case and however similar the circumstances facts in one case cannot be used as a precedent to determine the conclusion on the facts in another.
