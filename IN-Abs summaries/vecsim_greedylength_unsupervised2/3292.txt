This is an appeal by special leave against a decree passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana holding that the appeal filed by the plaintiff appellant has abated and dismissing his suit.
Som Dass the defendant contended that the Dera at Landeke was an independent Dera and that he was in possession of the properties of the Dera as its lawfully appointed mahant.
Against that decree an appeal was preferred by the appellant to the High Court.
While the appeal was pending in the High Court Som Dass the defendant died on 13 10 1970.
No application was made by the appellant to bring on record his legal representatives within the period prescribed.
The correctness of the date of death of Som Dass was contested by Shiam Dass.
The trial Court after taking evidence found that Som Dass died on 13 10 1970.
The appellant had raised an alternative contention before the High Court that there was no abatement of the appeal even if Som Dass was not impleaded within the period prescribed as he claimed to represent the dera as its duly elected Chela.
