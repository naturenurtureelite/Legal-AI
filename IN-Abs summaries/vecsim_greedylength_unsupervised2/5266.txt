On the other hand if relevant considerations are not borne in mind and irrele vant considerations influence the decision the Court may interfere in order to prevent a likelihood of prejudice to the public.
When the question involves the nice balancing of relevant considerations the Court may feel justified in resigning itself to acceptance of the decision of the concerned authority.
On February 12 1981 the Cabinet took a decision ap proving the proposal contained in the last paragraph of the Cabinet Memorandum thus clearing the way for negotiations with the Taj Group.
Meanwhile it appeared that the Public Undertakings Committee appointed by the West Bengal Legislative Assembly submitted a port on February 14 1981 about the zoo in which they stated.
It was suggested that the Government may consider abandoning the proposal to set up a hotel on the Eastern side of the Zoo.
In the meanwhile WEBCON a West Bengal Government Consultancy Undertaking was asked to examine the proposals and to advise the Government.
While so the Managing Committee of the Zoo on June 11 1981 passed a resolution expressing itself against the proposal to construct a hotel on land belonging to the Zoo.
He added that the Managing Committee s resolution was not binding on the Government and suggested that the Director of the Zoo might be asked to allow the Taj Group to undertake soil testing etc.
I agree.
Subsequent to the filing of the Writ Petition a lease deed was executed by the Taj Group of Hotels in favour of the Government.
Indira Gandhi 254 wrote to Mr Tata expressing her happiness that the Hotel was not going to upset the Zoo animals and welcoming his offer to help the State Government to improve the Zoo s facilities.
The Government was not unmindful of the interests and requirements of the Zoologi cal Garden though at that stage no detailed investigations had 257 apparently been made.
 The Act was made applicable to the public parks and gardens mentioned in the schedule.
