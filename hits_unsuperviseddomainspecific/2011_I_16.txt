rule 6 of the code of civil procedure1908.
after permitting the appellant therein to argue the case for acquittal on merits it observed we however make it clear that this can not be a universal practice in all cases.
the question whether the court will enlarge the scope of its inquiry at the time of final hearing depends on the facts and circumstances of the case.

quantum of sentence.
he fairly admitted that out of the maximum period of one year the appellant had served only 52 days in prison.
it is not in dispute that the provisions of the prevention of corruption act1988 alone are applicable since the incident occurred on 14 11 1997 i e subsequent to the act.
s 7 of the act relates to public servant taking gratification other than legal remuneration in respect of an official act.
if the said offence charge is proved the court has no other option but to impose sentence of imprisonment which shall be not less than six months but which may extend to five years and also liable to fine.
while holding office as a public servant obtains for any person any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage without any public interest or e if he or any person on his behalf is in possession or has at any time during the period of his office been in possession for which the public servant can not satisfactorily account of pecuniary resources or property disproportionate to his known sources of income.
such relaxation in the form of a proviso has been done away with in the 1988 act.
no other interpretation is permissible.
finally the special judge framed charges for offence punishable under sections 712131d read with s 132 of the act.
there is no dispute as regards the date of occurrence and the date of conviction passed by the trial court and affirmed by the high court.
inasmuch as the conviction on both counts have been confirmed by this court and we are confined to sentence part alone and in view of the minimum sentence prescribed u ss 7 and 13 of the act we are of the view that though long delay may be a ground for reduction of sentence in other cases the same may not be applicable to the case on hand when the statute prescribes minimum sentence.
it was further contended that the amount alleged to have been received by the appellant accused is only rs 200 and he also lost his job after conviction by the trial court.
though these grounds may be attractive in respect of other offences where minimum sentence is not prescribed in view of our reasonings in the earlier paras the same can not be applied to the case on hand.

the parties filed an application under section 13 b1 of the hindu marriage act1955 before the family court delhi seeking divorce by mutual consent.
however the court rejected the said application vide order dated 01 12 2009 observing that the court was not competent to waive the required statutory period of six months under the act and such a waiver was permissible only under the directions of the supreme court as held by this court in anil kumar jain vs maya jain2009.

in anjana kishore v puneet kishore 2002 10 scc 194 2001 indlaw sc 21204this court while allowing a transfer petition directed the court concerned to decide the case of divorce by mutual consent ignoring the statutory requirement of moving the motion after expiry of the period of six months under section 13 b2 of the act.
in anil kumar jain this court held that an order of waiving the statutory requirements can be passed only by this court in exercise of its powers u art 142 of the constitution.
however we have also noticed various judgments of this court taking a contrary view to the effect that in case the legal ground for grant of divorce is missing exercising such power tantamounts to legislation and thus transgression of the powers of the legislature which is not permissible in law vide chetan dass v kamla devi 2001 4 scc 250 2001 indlaw sc 20206 and vishnu dutt sharma.

though the supreme court would not pass any order u art 142 of the constitution which would amount to supplanting substantive law applicable or ignoring express statutory provisions dealing with the subject at the same time these constitutional powers can not in any way be controlled by any statutory provisions.
after elaborately discussing almost all the case laws on this subject about jurisdiction of this court under article 142summarised the same in the following words therefore the law in this regard can be summarised to the effect that in exercise of the power u art 142 of the constitution this court generally does not pass an order in contravention of or ignoring the statutory provisions nor is the power exercised merely on sympathy.
in mota ram vs state of haryana2009 12 scc 727 2009 indlaw sc 682this court while reiterating the above principles has concluded that art 142 can not be exercised to negate the statutory provisions.
in academy of nutrition improvement and others vs union of india jt 2011 8 sc 16 2011 indlaw sc 515the following conclusion about the applicability of art 142 is relevant.
1998 indlaw sc 688this court observed the supreme court in exercise of its jurisdiction u art 142 has the power to make such order as is necessary for doing complete justice between the parties in any cause or matter pending before it.
it is well recognised and established that this court has always been a law maker and its role travels beyond merely dispute settling.
in kalyan chandra sarkar v rajesh ranjan 2005 3.
it may therefore be understood that the plenary powers of this court u art 142 of the constitution are inherent in the court and are complementary to those powers which are specifically conferred on the court by various statutes though are not limited by those statutes these.
see supreme court bar association 1998 indlaw sc 688 supra.
though the jurisdiction of this court u art 142 of the constitution of india is not in dispute we make it clear that exercise of such power would however depend on the facts and circumstances of each case.
u art 142 of the constitution would not ordinarily direct quashing of a case involving crime against the society particularly.
in a case of corruption by public servant quantum of amount is immaterial.
however this court would not pass any order u art 142 which would amount to supplant the substantive law applicable or ignoring statutory provisions dealing with the subject.
in other words acting under article 142this court can not pass an order or grant relief which is totally inconsistent or goes against the substantive or statutory enactments pertaining to the case.
the trial judge is directed to secure his presence for serving the remaining period of sentence.
