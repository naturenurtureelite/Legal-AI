for determination of the issue involved in c a nos 6169 6171 of 2013 and c a nos 6172 6174 of 2013it is desirable to refer the relevant factual matrix of the case which is as follows. the authority while so determining shall take into consideration the liability of the company as on 28th october1984including labour charges sales tax loan amount given by the state government etc if payable. it is also not in dispute that labour and other dues were payable by the company apart from sale tax dues and the loan was given by the state government between 1977 1984 for payment of such dues. in the present case we find that there was no mis representation on the part of the auction purchasers they deposited the total auction amount within the time stipulated. furthermore the state has not been able to produce any recovery certificate of any department showing any dues against the company. as per provisions of the u p state sugar undertakings acquisition act1971 hereinafter referred to as the acquisition act1971as amended in the year 1984free from all encumbrances and the said unit was vested with the u p state sugar corporation hereinafter referred to as the corporation. the high court though noticed that s 8 of the u p state sugar undertakings acquisition act1971 empowers the prescribed authority to decide any dispute regarding the amount payable to any person or authority in respect of earlier liabilities of the undertaking but it wrongly held that in view of the provisions of the u p sugar undertakings acquisition act1971. the collector tulsi gaur was not a party by name. on the other hand learned counsel for the respondents made the following submissions i no amount whatsoever is due and payable by the company to the state. it was further ordered that a detailed list of the assets be prepared and signed by both the parties and the assets be transferred to the company. the question arises as to whether in such a situation an auction purchaser can claim interest on equitable ground. we have heard the parties only on the limited question as to why the amount which has been directed to be refunded to the auction purchasers appellants herein should not bear reasonable interest. the grievance of the appellant state is that the high court while passing the impugned order has not noticed the liability incurred by the undertaking and the loan paid to the company. it has been ordered to refund amount in favour of the auction purchaser appellants we find no reason as to why on equitable grounds the appellants should not get interest on the said amount. march2011 was passed in writ petition no 313781996etc. the order dated 20th february1992 passed by the collector was also not under challenge inspite of the same the high court declared the order dated 20th february1992 as illegal. the collector has no power to adjudicate the dues under the u p zamindari abolition and land revenue act and is merely a recovery agent to recover sums payable as arrears of land revenue upon receipt of a valid recovery certificate. february1992 the impugned judgment dated 1st march2011 has been challenged by the state of u p in c a nos 6169 6171 of 2013 state of u p ors. 6 from 1 4 2000 till amounts payable as rental compensation are paid to the landowners concerned. till date there has not been a single determination adjudication by any court authority of any dues against the company nor is there any claim pending before any authority or before any court on date. in the said case compensation amount of rs 4 33 crores was awarded by special land acquisition officer vide award dated 22nd february1990. april2003 in c a nos 7123 7124 of 2003 held that this court is satisfied that no fault can be found with the impugned judgment of the high court so far as the setting aside of the sale is concerned we dismiss the appeals so far it relates to cancellation of auction sale. in a situation like in the present case one can not hold of any statute entitling the auction purchasers to claim interest in case the auction got cancelled or set aside by the court of law. the state has been given liberty to realize the said amount from those authorities to whom it was wrongly paid by the previous collector tulsi gaur under his order dated 20th. however it was clarified that if the land which have been acquired finally does not fall within the ceiling limit of the company then it will be open for the state to recover it after the finalisation of the ceiling proceedings as per law. pursuant to uttar pradesh imposition of ceiling of land holdings act hereinafter referred to as the ceiling actland admeasuring 723 3 bigha belonging to the company was declared surplus. it was ordered to dispose of the writ petition expeditiously. the high court initially passed an interim order on 17th july1997 as under considering the facts and the circumstances of the case the respondents are directed to pay to m s ltd.
meerut the amount of compensation money amounting to rs 43394783 40 after deducting a sum of rs 16202402 20 interest and collection charges within a period of two months from today. the state government filed the deduction statement for recovery of the dues before the prescribed authority constituted under u p sugar undertaking acquisition act1971 however the aforesaid claim was rejected by the prescribed authority by order dated 4th october1994 in claim no 13 of 1999.
against the said order dated 4th october1994 passed by the prescribed authority the appellant filed appeal no 195 before the appellate tribunal. the review application was disposed of by an order dated 3rd september2001 with the following observations in view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances in my opinion it will meet the ends of justice if i grant three months time to the respondent no 2 and 3 to refund the amount in question to the auction purchasers application during this time the said amount shall positively be paid to them. on 24th january2003c a nos 7123 24 of 2003 preferred by shri munindra singh anr were taken up and this court passed the following order delay condoned. in state of maharashtra and others vs maimuma banu and others2003 7 scc 448 2003 indlaw sc 625the question arose as to whether interest was payable on rental compensation. hence the appointment of receiver was terminated with immediate effect. in the said case government resolution provided for payment of rental compensation expeditiously but no provision was made to pay interest in case of delayed payment. another application was filed by m s ltd under order xivii rule 1 cpc for review of the order dated 3rd september2001 the said review application was dismissed by the impugned judgment dated 15th march2002. ltd being aggrieved by the said judgment preferred review application under order xlvii rule 1 cpc for review of the judgment and order dated 27th april2001 passed by the high court. the order dated 05 04 1999 annexure 23order dated 30 05 1992 annexure 7sale proclamation dated 28 3 1992 annexure 2 are hereby quashed and the respondents are directed to restore back status quo ante as on before the auction sale dated 28 04 1992 was held within a period of two weeks from the date a certified copy of this order is communicated to the competent authority. taking into consideration the aforesaid factor while working out equities it would therefore be appropriate to direct the state to pay interest at the rate of 6 on the amount to be refunded as per the high court s order with effect from 27th april2001 and 3rd. pootha farm. the said writ petition was allowed by the learned single judge by the impugned judgment and order dated 27th april2001 with following observations for the facts and reasons stated above this petition succeeds and is hereby allowed. title to the land was also transferred in their favour. it has not been in dispute that the title of the land was also transferred in their favour. ltd and another were the highest bidders. subsequently impugned common judgment and order dated 1st. the learned counsel for the petitioners invites our attention to the order dated 20 10 2002 page 94c of the paper book issue notice to respondent nos 1 to 4 limited to the question as to why the amount which will be directed to be refunded to the petitioners herein consequent upon the sale having been set aside should not bear reasonable interest. for the reason aforesaid the impugned order dated 1st march2011 passed by the high court in w p no 10220 of 1996 etc cannot be upheld. the appellants m s.
rudra estate pvt. by judgment and order dated 7th july2010 passed in special appeal nos 5179 802010the high court quashed the interim order dated 17th july1997 passed by the learned single judge. the writ petitions were disposed of by the learned single judge of allahabad high court by a common judgment dated 1st. it was followed by a notification dated 4th september1987 issued u s 6 of the acquisition act. payments so made shall be subject to final decision of the writ petition. but for the reasons mentioned by the high court the sale has been cancelled. this court in the said case held 10 the crucial question is whether there can be any direction for interest on rental compensation once it is held that the same has to be paid within the time frame notwithstanding the fact that there is no statutory obligation. the aforesaid orders were also challenged by the state government. by order dated 12th october1995the appellate tribunal directed the appellant to file a fresh deduction claim before the prescribed authority. out of the 3 special leave petitions the only special leave petition which we find worth being entertained after hearing the learned senior counsel for the petitioners is as against the order dated 15 3 2002 issue notice to respondents no 2 to 4 only limited to the question as to why the amount directed to be refunded to the petitioner should not bear reasonable interest. after hearing the learned counsel for the petitioners we are satisfied that no fault can be found with the impugned judgment of the high court so far as the setting aside of the sale is concerned. the high court by judgment and order dated 23rd february2011 quashed the notice dated 22nd august2005. it is ordered accordingly. september2001the day the high court passed the impugned order. in view of the fact that this court vide order dated 27th. permission to file the special leave petition is granted. this factor can not be lost sight of while working out the equities. it is however seen that the writ applications were filed long after the possession was taken. the other two special leave petitions are dismissed. there being cross claims all of these appeals were heard together for determination by a common judgment. an order was passed to appoint a chartered accountant to complete the audit of the accounts. with observation and directions as referred to above. it would therefore be appropriate if the appellants pay interest. though the inevitable conclusion is that the high court is not justified in directing grant of interest on the logic of various provisions contained in the act yet there is an element of equity in favour of the landowners. the concerned respondents are directed accordingly. according to the appellant the aforesaid issue has not been decided. the said case was also tagged with the aforesaid appeals. dasti service in addition is permitted. 11 it is not in dispute that in certain cases payments have already been made. this direction shall not apply to those cases where the payments have already been made prior to 1 4 2000 appeals are allowed to the extent indicated without any stipulation of costs. against the interim order the appellant state filed the special appeals. the same is accordingly set aside. we have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the records. no costs. appeals dismissed.
