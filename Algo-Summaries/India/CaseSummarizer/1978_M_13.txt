s 2xv defines nonproprietary jagir as meaning a jagir which consists of a right in the jagirdar to appropriate as incident of the jagir land revenue or rent due to government from persons holding land in a jagir village but which does not consist of any right or interest in the soil.
s 2xviii defines proprietary jagir as meaning a jagir in respect of which the jagirdar under the terms of a grant or agreement or by custom or usage is entitled to any rights or interest in the soil.
proprietary jagir has been defined in s 2xviii to mean a jagir in respect of which the jagirdar under the terms of a grant or agreement or by custom or usage is entitled to any rights or interest in the soil.
s 2vii defines jagirdar as meaning a holder of a jagir village and includes his co sharer.
thirdly the quantum of compensation payable for abolition of jagir and extinguishment of his other rights depends upon what kind of jagir has been abolished whether it is proprietary or non proprietary in other words it is clear that the inquiry into the nature of the jagir under s 2 4 i is for the purpose of determining the quantum of compensation payable to a jagirdar inasmuch as in the case of a non proprietary jagir the jagirdar is entitled to compensation at the rate of three times the amount of land revenue received by or due to him as an incident of jagir during the five years immediately before the appointed date under s 11 1while in the case of a proprietary jagir in respect of land held by a permanent holder the jagirdar is entitled to compensation equivalent to three multiples of the assessment fixed for such land s 113 provides for compensation and computation thereof to a jagirdar having any right or interest in any property referred to in s 8 in such an inquiry ordinarily no determination of any rights of the jagirdar to mines or mineral products in a jagir village will be undertaken for no compensation is payable in respect of any rights to mines and mineral products in a jagir village.
the general question is whether once the competent authority under s 2 4 i of the act declares that the particular jagir is a proprietary one a further inquiry under s 372 of the land revenue code with a view to determining whether the jagirdar had rights to mines and mineral products in such jagir subsisting on the appointed date is competent.
s 11 1 provides for the quantum of compensation payable to a non proprietary jagirdar on account of abolition of his jagir and extinguishment of his rights while s 112 makes similar provision for quantum of compensation to a proprietary jagirdar on account of the abolition of his jagir and extinguishment of his rights.
in other words the competent authority holding an inquiry under s 24 i can come to the conclusion that a particular jagir is proprietary if it finds that the jagirdar under the terms of a grant or agreement is entitled to some rights or interest in the soil other than mines or mineral products.
i whether a jagir is proprietary or non proprietary iiwhether any land is ghatked or jiwai or iiiwhetherany person is a permanent holder.
it is therefore not possible to accept the contention of learned counsel for the respondents that a determination under s 2 4 i of the act to the effect that a particular jagir is a proprietary one necessarily implies that the grantee is entitled to mines and mineral products in the villages comprised in the grant especially when having regard to the definition given in s 2xviii a jagir could be proprietary without a right to mines and mineral products.
there is yet one more aspect emerging from the definition of the expression proprietary jagir which leads to the same inference.
No v of 1879 with a view to determining whether the jagirdar had any rights to mines or mineral products in his jagir granted or recognised under any contract grant or law for the time being in force or by custom or usage is competent.
no xxxix of 1954 declares that a particular jagir is a proprietary one a further inquiry under s 37 2 of the bombay land revenue code bombay act.
secondly compensation is made payable under s 11 of the act to jagirdars whose jagirs and other incidental rights have been extinguished but it will be pertinent to note that no provision has been made for payment of compensation in respect of rights to mines and mineral products in a jagir village obviously because if by the grant in question the jagirdar has not been given any rights to mines and mineral products no compensation would be payable and if there be a grant of mines and mineral products the same have been saved to the jagirdar under s 10 of the act.
according to the respondent by these grants parvanas read together he was given full proprietary rights in the soil of the said villages that is to say it was a proprietary jagir that was granted to him by the then ruler.
in other words our answer to the general question raised above would be that even after the competent authority has declared a particular jagir to be a proprietary one under s 24.
i of the act a further inquiry under s 372 of the bombay land revenue code into the question whether a jagirdar had any subsisting rights to mines and mineral products in the jagir villages on the appointed date would be competent unless the grant of a right to mines and mineral products or the actual enjoyment thereof in keeping with the grant happens to be the basis of the determination under s 2 4 1 of the act.
as a consequence of the abolition of jagirs under s 3 all jagir villages became unalienated villages and therefore under s 4 it has been provided that all jagir villages shall be liable to the payment of land revenue in accordance with the provisions of the code and the rules made thereunder and the provisions of the code and the rules relating to unalienated land shall apply to such villages.
according to learned counsel the mere circumstance that the respondent 's jagir was found under s 24.
i to be proprietary was not tantamount to the establishment by the respondent of his rights to mines and mineral products in the villages of his jagir for which there must be an actual grant or contract or law or custom or usage recognising such rights and this could only be determined by the collector by holding an inquiry under s 372 of the bombay land revenue code and therefore the high court was clearly in error in coming to the conclusion that the inquiry initiated by the second appellant under s 372 of the bombay land revenue code was incompetent or without jurisdiction.
learned counsel for the appellants has contended that the high court has adopted an erroneous view of the scope and ambit of the inquiry contemplated under s 24i of the act by the competent authority in as much as under the said provision the competent authority had power merely to decide the question whether the respondents jagir was a proprietary or a non proprietary jagir and had no dower or jurisdiction to determine whether on the appointed date that is on august 11954 when the act came into force the respondent had subsisting rights to mines and minerals products in the jagir villages so as to be saved under s 10 of the act.
these aspects bring out true scope and ambit of the inquiry under sec 24i and clearly show that the determination of the question whether a jagir is proprietary or nonproprietary does not necessarily involve the determination of the question whether the jagirdar had any rights to mines and mineral products on the appointed date it is true that prima facie the owner of the surface of the land would be entitled to everything beneath the land and ordinarily mines and mineral products would pass with the right to the surface but this would be so in the absence of any reservations made in the grant if there be reservations or qualifications in regard to mines or mineral products in the grant then these would not pass.
it appears that for the purpose of implementing the provisions of the act the competent authority collector of district sabarkantha held an inquiry into the question whether the respondent 's jigir was proprietary involving any right or interest in the soil or non proprietary involving mere assignment of land revenue or rent due to government under s 2 4 i of the act and having regard to the documentary and other evidence led before it the competent authority by its order dated september 81959held that the daljitgarh jagir of the respondent was a proprietary jagir.
admittedly on the coming into force of the bombay merged territories and areas jagirs abolition act1953 hereinafter referred to as the act i e with effect from respondent 's daljitgarh jagir stood abolished and all his rights in the jagir villages save as expressly provided by or under the act were extinguished and the respondent became entitled to compensation under s 11 of the act.
we may state that counsel for the respondent categorically stated before the court that his client was confining his right to excavating only one type of mineral product namely gravel and stones and that too from only two villages namely kapoda and isarwada comprised in his jagir in regard to which the mamlatdar 's order dated november 241959was quite clear and therefore he urged that the further inquiry under s 372 of the code into that very right was misconceived and uncalled for.
he urged that having regard to such determination that was made by the competent authority under s 2 4 i of the act it would be clear that a further inquiry into the respondent 's rights to mines and mineral products particularly gravel and stones under s 372 of the code would be misconceived and incompetent.
the high court negatived the contentions urged by the appellants and took the view that in the determination by the competent authority under s 2 4 i of the act that the respondent 's jagir was a proprietary one there was implicit decision that the respondent was a grantee of the soil which included sub soil entitling him to mines and mineral products and as such a further inquiry by the collector under s 372 of the bombay land revenue code was incompetent and without jurisdiction and therefore the collector 's order dated february 231973 was liable to be quashed.
in these circumstances it would be fair and proper that the respondent is not subjected to a further inquiry under s 372 of the code so far as his right to excavating gravel and stones from the two villages of kapoda and isarwada is concerned.
he further urged that the two letters addressed by the respondent one to the collector on october 111968 and the other to the mamlatdar on october 41971merely contained a request to make appropriate entries in the revenue records based on the mamlatdar 's order dated november 241959 and therefore the collector could not pronounce upon those letters as containing a claim put forward by the respondent for the first time to mines and mineral products in the said jagir villages to initiate an inquiry under s 372 of the bombay land revenue de.
