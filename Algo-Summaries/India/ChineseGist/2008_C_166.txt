the appeal was filed u s 21 of the m p uchacha nyayalay khand nyaypeth ko appeal adhiniyam2005.
hereinafter referred to as the act it was held that the order was passed in exercise of power of superintendence u art 227 of the constitution of india1950 in short the constitution against which the letters patent appeal is not maintainable.
that being so the mere fact that the writ petition was styled u art 227 of the constitution is of no consequence.
it is the nature of the relief sought for and the controversy involved which determines the article which is applicable.
the earlier order passed by this court dated 22 8 2006 reads as follows heard.
since the impugned order is passed by a learned single judge.
the normal remedy is to file a letters patent appeal.
the special leave petition is disposed of accordingly.
underlined for emphasis.
the high court was directed to dispose of the lpa on merits if it was otherwise free from defect.
on that score alone the high court 's order is unsustainable.
in addition the high court seems to have gone by the nomenclature gone by the nomenclature i e the discription given in the writ petition to be one u art 227 of the constitution.
the high court did not consider the nature of the controversy and the prayer involved in the writ petition.
s 2 of the act reads as follows 21.
as noted above the prayer in the writ petition was to set aside the decision of the assessing officer.

the event in his judgment the learned single judge himself had mentioned the particular article of the constitution under which he was passing his judgment in an appeal under cl 15 against such a judgment it may not be necessary for the appellate bench to elaborately examine the question of its maintainability.

jj considered the very same question in the light of cl 15 of the letters patent of the bombay high court.
the question is whether an appeal would lie from the decision of the single judge in such a case.
transport society ltd air 1961 punj 24 1960 indlaw pnh 196 and we are in agreement with it.
the aforesaid decision squarely gets attracted on the facts of the present case.
point 1 is therefore answered in the affirmative against the appellant and in favour of the respondent.
the pleadings as has been indicated hereinabove also assume immense significance.
it will depend upon factual matrix of the case.
without entering into niceties and technicality of the subject we venture to state the broad general difference between the two jurisdictions.
in exercise of supervisory jurisdiction the high court may not only quash or set aside the impugned proceedings judgment or order but it may also make such directions as the facts and circumstances of the case may warrant maybe by way of guiding the inferior court or tribunal as to the manner in which it would now proceed further or afresh as commended to or guided by the high court.
in addition a bare reading of this court 's earlier order shows that the impugned order is clearly erroneous.
the impugned order is set aside.
the writ appeal shall be heard by the division bench on merits.
the appeal is allowed.
