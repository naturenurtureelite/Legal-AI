for the sake of convenience we refer to the facts mentioned in civil appeal no of 2008 arising out of s l p c no 15729 of 2008 filed by j mitra co pvt ltd.
this matter is a classic illustration of the confusion which has emerged on account of the postponement of in part commencement of patents amendment act2005.
quite often the commencement of an act is postponed to some specified future date or to such date as the appropriate government may by notification in the official gazette appoint.
provision is also at times made for appointment of different dates for coming into force of different parts of the same act.

a right of appeal was available to the aggrieved party against orders passed under s 25 the said appellate remedy was available by way of an appeal to the high court.
in 2002the legislature desired an amendment to the law and intended to create an appellate forum to hear appeals against orders passed by the controller consequently patents amendment.
act2002 was promulgated on 25 6 2002 however it was not brought into force immediately.
it may be noted that in the said amendment act2002no provision was made pertaining to post grant opposition.
that provision came to be made only under the patents amendment act2005 which was promulgated on 4 4 2005 w e f 1 1 2005.

suffice it to note that ss 116 and 117a were not brought into force.

without giving effect to the amendments to ss 116 and 117a suggested by s 47 of the patents amendment.
act2002on 4 4 2005.
the legislature enacted the patents amendment act2005 even here not all provisions were simultaneously brought into force.
only certain sections of the patents amendment act2005 were brought into force.
vide s 23 of the patents amendment.
act2005the then existing s 25 was substituted.
the substituted s 25 reads as under 25 opposition to the patent 1.
d that the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification was publicly known or publicly used in india before the priority date of that claim.
having regard to the knowledge oral or otherwise available within any local or indigenous community in india or elsewhere but on no other ground.

we also quote s 61 of the patents amendment act2005 which reads as under s 61 in section 117a of the principal act as inserted by s 47 of the patents amendment act2002in.
sub section 2for the words and figures section 20section 25section 27section 28the words figures and brackets section 20sub s 4 of section 25section 28 shall be substituted.
this section was not brought into force till 2 4 2007.
in short by the patents amendment act2005for the first time a dichotomy was introduced in the patent law between opposition to the pre grant and opposition to the post grant of patent.
this was the major structural change in the patent law.
similarly under the patents amendment act2005appeal was restricted to the post grant opposition orders and that appeal lay before the appellate board and not to the high court.
here also s 25 of the patents act1970 as amended by patents amendment act2005.
as stated vide patents amendment.
act2005a dichotomy was brought in between pre grant and post grant opposition orders.
this is the controversy which needs to be resolved in this case.
on 19 10 2006 when fao no 29306 was filed in the high court chapter xix of the parent act as amended vide patents amendment.
act1999 continued to be in operation notwithstanding the enactment of the patents.
amendment act2002 and the patents amendment.
that amended s 117 g is consequential to the enforcement of the jurisdiction of the appellate board u s 64 which results to revocation of patent.
according to the appellant with the change in s 25 brought about by patents amendment act2005a dichotomy was introduced in the patents act1970 according to the appellant that dichotomy was between pre grant opposition and post grant opposition.
according to the appellant this was a structural change in the principal act.
this was not done.
at times provision is made for appointment of different dates for coming into force of different parts of the same act.
by reason of patents amendment act2005the kind of opposition available under the said 1970 act is different from what existed earlier.
previously there was no post grant opposition.
previously the only provision of challenge by an interested party was a pre grant challenge under s 25 1 as it then stood.
therefore the courts had evolved the rule of caution as the patent had not faced any challenge at the hands of interested parties.
there is however a radical shift due to incorporation of s 252 where an interested party is granted the right to challenge the patent after its grant.
the ground of challenge under s 251 is identical to s 252 of the said 1970 act.
however s 251 is wider than s 252 as the latter is available only to a person aggrieved.
the main difference between s 251 and s 252as brought about by patents amendment.
act2005is that even after a patent is grantedpost grant opposition can be filed under s 25 2 for a period of one year.
the reason is obvious.
in relation to patents that are of recent origin a higher scrutiny is necessary.
this is the main rationale underlying s 252 of the said 1970 act.
in the present case the legislature intended to provide for two types of scrutiny followed by one statutory appeal to the appellate board against post grant proceedings.
the legislature intended to have a dichotomy between pre grant opposition and post grant opposition.
however the legislature intended that there shall be only one statutory appeal against grant of patent.
the legislature intended to obliterate appeal from pre grant proceedingswhich existed earlier.
however it was left to the executive to bring the enacted law into force vide notification.
it is during this interregnum that respondent no 3 filed its fao no 29306 in the high court under section 116as.
it stood on 19 10 06 under the patents amendment act1999 on that date the amended section 117a suggested by patents amendment act2005was not brought into force.
on 19 10 06 the old law prevailed under which an appeal lay before the high court.
respondent no 3in both the cases preferred first appeals to the high court u s 116 as it then stood.
they are fao no 29206 and fao.
no 29306 we have to decide the fate of these pending appeals.
one more aspect needs to be mentioned.
no 29206 and fao.
no 29306would remain in the high court.
no 3 we are informed that there are hardly one or two matters of this nature which are pending.
therefore we are of the view that respondent.
no 3 can not be let without remedy.
the appellate board after 2 4 07 is entitled to hear appeals only arising from orders passed by the controller under s 254i e.
in cases of orders passed in post grant opposition.
therefore there is no point in transferring the pending fao no 29206 and fao no 29306 to the appellate board which has no authority to decide matters concerning pre grant opposition.
u s 116 under patents.
amendment act1999 against orders passed by the controller in pre grant opposition proceedings.
accordingly the two civil appeals filed by the appellant herein stand disposed of with no order as to costs.
appeal disposed of.
