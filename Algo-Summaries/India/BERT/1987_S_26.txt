on or about 24th of october1960
however the document is silent as to where the business was started
another partnership deed being exhibit 69 came to be executed among the six persons and the father of the appellant girdharlal
the document is exhibit 69 and is signed by the father of the appellant and the appellant himself also
the said partnership deed records six persons who were to run the business in manufacturing and selling bharat neon signs tubes
it may be mentioned that the partnership deed exhibit 114 was executed by six persons and at that stage the appellant or his father were not partners in the firm
it is clear from the evidence on record that the partnership firm had undergone metamorphosis from time to time and again ever since the year 1960 the firm bharat neon signs first originated on 4th of october1960 as many as six persons were named in the partnership firm on or about 4th of october1960 and they had executed a deed of partnership on 13th of october1960 which is exhibit 114 on the record
but thereafter when the partnership deed exhibit 69 was executed the appellant and his father joined the firm with an agreement to share profits only and their share was fixed at 0 03 paise in a rupee
there is a third partnership deed exhibit 70 which showed that the deceased tenant girdharlal had died on 1st of february1961 and so by the remaining seven partners with same terms and conditions a new partnership deed being exhibit 70 was executed on 22nd
september1961 at this time the share of the appellant was fixed at 0 03 paise in a rupee to share the profits only
whether the appellant herein and his father had sublet the premises in question in or about 1960 in terms of section 131e of the bombay rents hotel and lodging house rates control act1947
the respondent had further alleged that the appellant no 1 had closed the business and he was not using the said premises for the purpose for which it was let to him
weaving works and according to the terms of tenancy suit premises were leased for manufacturing cloth in the name of ahmedabad fine
the main controversy was whether the appellant had sublet the premises to defendant no 2bharat neon signs or whether he being a partner of the said firm had permitted the said firm to use the premises in question
it may be mentioned that the respondent no 1 is the landlord of two premises which were quite adjacent as mentioned before
it was the case of the appellant that in respect of the suit premises he was carrying on his business with respondents
hereinafter called the rent act is the question involved in this appeal by special leave from the judgment and order of the high court of gujarat dated 21st of august1979
in 1965 some partners retired and the remaining four partners executed a fresh partnership deed exhibit 117 on 1st
the respondent had alleged in the two suits that the appellant was his tenant in the suit premises which were leased out to him and before him his father for conducting the business in the name of ahmedabad fine
the respondent plaintiff had alleged in both the suits that the appellant was his tenant in the suit premises which were leased to him for conducting his business in the name of ahmedabad fine
in the premises the appeal was allowed
the present appellant who was the original defendant no 1 claimed to be a partner
nos 24 and 5 in the name of respondent no 2m s
at the time of the institution of the suit the defendants nos 2 to 5 were admittedly the partners
in order to decide this question it is necessary to decide the scope and ambit of section 292 of the rent act
bharat neon signs hereinafter referred to as respondent no 2
the deeds gave the appellant the right to share the profits and made him agent for certain limited purposes of the firm and there was evidence that the partnership deeds were acted upon
we are concerned in this appeal with only one of the premises which was involved in suit no 553 of 1969 it is not in dispute and it never was that the premises was being used by bharat neon signs firm being the defendant no 2 in the original suit
the respondent is the landlord of the two premises and these were situated at raikhad ward ahmedabad
there was an appeal before the court of small causes bombay and by judgment and order delivered by the court of small causes bombay on 18th of august1977it was held that the learned trial judge had erred in passing a decree for possession on the ground of subletting change of user and breach of terms of tenancy
there was evidence of suit of dissolution of the partnership where none of the partners took the plea that it was a false or a fictitious document
in phiroze bamanji desai v chandrakant m patel ors 1974 3 scr 267 1974 indlaw sc 282 the question involved was whether there was reasonable and bona fide requirement of premises for personal use and occupation as also the question of greater hardship under the bombay rent act and the ambit and scope of the power of section 293 of the said act with which we are concerned came up for consideration
kapur j who delivered a separate judgment however observed that the power under section 351 of the said act of interference by the high court is not restricted to a proper trial according to law or error in regard to onus of proof or proper opportunity of being heard
this court was of the view that what the high court could see is that there has been no miscarriage of justice and that the decision was according to law in the sense mentioned
weaving works and according to the terms of tenancy suit the suit premises were leased for manufacturing cloth in the name of ahmedabad fine weaving works
in the eye of law such a clause is really non sequitur or neutral proving neither the existence nor non existence of a genuine firm
it was further held that whether there was subletting was not a mixed question of law and fact
april1965 this last partnership deed was executed by the appellant and original defendants
the expression according to law in section 35 of the said act referred to the decision as a whole and was not to be equated to errors of law or of fact simpliciter
to decide this facts must be referred to
but the question is from the three deeds itself which were examined in detail by the court of small causes and which were re examined by the high court could it be said unequivocally that there was no partnership
the first partnership deed which is exhibit 114 is dated 13th october1960 it recited that the partnership firm should be presently started at ahmedabad and the same should later be started in another city
the appellant claimed to be the tenant in respect of the two premises which are quite adjacent to each other one of which is involved in this appeal
it is very much wider than that when in the opinion of the high court the decision is erroneous on the question of law which affects the merits of the case or decision was manifestly unjust the high court is entitled to interfere
the power to hear a revision is generally given to a superior court so that it may satisfy itself that a particular case is decided according to law
the suit inter alia was filed by the landlord on the ground of subletting
though the decree in the dissolution suit was not binding in these proceedings inter se between the parties as partners it is a piece of evidence which can not be wholly ignored
there is nothing inherently illegal or improbable making a provision of such a type
but there is nothing illegal about it
unless the statute conferring the right to appeal limits the re hearing in some way
it was sufficient for the rent court to proceed on the finding that the appellant and s were living together as husband and wife whether they were legally married or not
the trial court in the instant appeal held that there was subletting
it accordingly decreed the suit for possession instituted by the landlord
the clause of the partnership deed provided that there should be a fixed percentage of profit to be given to the partner appellant no 1 the appellant was not to share the losses
