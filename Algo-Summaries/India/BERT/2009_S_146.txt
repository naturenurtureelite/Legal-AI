in the meanwhile residents of the locality had gathered in the courtyard and told the accused persons not to assault rauji
thereafter pw 21 along with p i dsa gave a call to the inmates of the house to open the door and on hearing the call one lady opened the door
facts giving rise to the present appeal may be stated first so as to enable us to appreciate the arguments raised by the parties more effectively
there was already an oil lamp burning which was attached to the ceiling by a brass chain
on receipt of the aforesaid message pw 21 along with asi tabit mamlekar went to the scene of offence
the juvenile offender sarita went inside the house and brought out one iron pipe which she handed over to the appellant who then hit the said pipe on the right leg of pw 1 and also gave a blow with the said pipe on rauji s right hand
pw 8 pw 18 and pw 1 then lifted rauji and brought him in the courtyard

the said fact is proved by the evidence of pws
in the meantime pw 1 pw 2 and pw 8 came to the house from whom pw 21 made certain inquiries and brought them along with accused no 3 and her two juvenile girls to the police station
then accused no 3 told the appellant and accused no 2 to finish off rauji first

in animireddy venkata ramana and others v public prosecutor high court of andhra pradesh 2008 5 scc 368 2008 indlaw sc 354 this court while considering a similar case observed as follows 10
the ratio of the decision in bhagwant kishore joshi 1963 indlaw sc 268 supra is applicable to the facts of the present case as the police officer merely visited the spot and place of occurrence and made some survey which can not be regarded as investigation
it was also alleged that the other juvenile offender sharmila brought a cement block shaped like an elephant trunk which she handed over to accused no 3 with which accused no 3 started assaulting rauji
he in his deposition specifically stated that he found that the back door as well as the front door of the house were latched from inside and in front of the house there was a road where there was an electricity pole and there was a street tube light by which the house could be visible and even the lights of the vehicles were flashed at the house
meanwhile accused no 3 started abusing pw 1 pw 8 pw 18 and the deceased rauji
there is no evidence to show that at that point of time pw 21 seized any articles or interrogated any witnesses or took any other action in initiating or in furtherance of investigation
it is also the case of the prosecution that as a result of the aforesaid stab injuries given to the deceased he expired on the same day i e on 19 04 1988
there was indeed some scuffle between the parties during the course of which accused no 1 received simple injuries and the deceased died of the two stab injuries inflicted by the present appellant
he stated that although the house had electricity connection but was not having the electricity supply
p s joaquim dias pw 21 who was attached to the ponda police station as p s i received a phone call at about 10 45 p m from p s i k k desai of the panaji police station that a person named rauji dulba sawant had been brought in police jeep by police constable jaisingrao rane and that while he was being taken to the goa medical college he expired
besides the fact of his going to the place of occurrence would not amount to making an investigation
at that time pw 2 came there and questioned the accused persons as to what they were doing whereupon the appellant and accused no 2 started assaulting pw 2 also
the deceased was taken to the hospital and while so taken he died
therefore he proceeded to survey the place of occurrence with the help of torches
he next submitted that there was no evidence on record as to when the fir reached the magistrate and that none of the courts below considered the said aspect
therefore recording of the fir at about 3 00 a m in the morning was justified and properly explained and it can not be said that there was any delay in recording the fir
he also submitted that if two views are possible and if there are lacunae in the case of the prosecution the benefit must go to the accused
thereafter according to pw 1 accused no 3 handed back the knife to the appellant and accused no 2 brought the oil lamp which was hung in the room and hit the oil lamp on the head of rauji the deceased
it was also alleged that when pw 8 tried to intervene the other three accused started assaulting her with fists and slaps
at that time the appellant who was holding the knife in his hand handed over the same to accused no 3 by which she assaulted pw 8 but pw 8 caught the knife in her hand which caused injury to her right palm

it was further submitted that the alleged eye witnesses of the occurrence were examined by the police belatedly and that the medical evidence adduced in the case does not in any manner support the ocular evidence and if at all it would not be a case of culpable homicide amounting to murder but a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder
he submitted that since the investigation in the instant case was started by the police without recording an fir such an fir is necessarily hit by the provisions of section 162 of the cr
