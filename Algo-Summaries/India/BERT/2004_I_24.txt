work has been taken by the respondent from all the appellants except four
no case was made out by the appellants herein in their statements of claim that they became permanent employees in terms thereof
all the employees have been working in the establishment of the respondents for last 5 6 years
respondents had also mentioned in their claim that there was a proposal to hand over the colony of oda project to indore municipal corporation
there is also nothing on records to show that such a claim was put forward even in the demand raising the industrial dispute
the salary fixed by the commissioner was earlier given to all engineers and later on they were given the salary fixed by the collector
the appellants were appointed by the indore development authority
we have noticed the provisions of the act and the rules
there is no difference in their work and the work of the employees of indore development authority
presumably the appellants were aware of the statutory limitations in this behalf
the labour court on the basis of the materials produced before it arrived at the following findings 1
aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the said award the respondent authority herein filed a writ petition before the madhya pradesh high court indore bench which was marked as writ petition no 1188 of 1997
by reason of the impugned judgment dated 26 4 2000 the said writ petition was allowed
the high court accepted the contention of the respondent authority that the appellants were not appointed against the sanctioned posts and their services were taken on account of the said oda project which was implemented through the agency of the respondent authority
these appeals arising out of a judgment and order dated 26 4 2000 passed in writ petition no 1188 of 1997 by the high court of madhya pradesh indore bench involving similar questions of law and fact were taken up for hearing together and are being disposed of by this common judgment
they were also being granted the benefit of leave
allegedly from their salary provident fund was being deducted
the parties filed their respective pleadings before the labour court and also adduced their respective evidences
the learned counsel would submit that the sufficient materials were brought on records to show that vacancies were available and as the appellants worked for a period of more than six months they became permanent employees in terms of the act
a dispute arose as to whether all the appellants were employed for the purpose of the said project or the appellants in civil appeal no 337 of 2002 were appointed in the year 1991 by the authority for its own job
the appellant nos 1 and 2 are degree holders in civil engineering and appellant nos
furthermore the labour court having derived its jurisdiction from the reference made by the state government it was bound to act within the four corners thereof
we have used the term keeping in view the provisions of 1963 rules
the oda project is said to have been completed and only the maintenance thereof was to be looked after by the indore municipal corporation
on or about 17 3 1997 however they began receiving a salary of rs 1500 per month
it was further contended that as the respondents despite direction to produce documents including the offers for appointment did not produce the same an adverse inference should have been drawn against them by the high court
2whether it is valid and proper for not giving equal salary to these sub engineers like other sub engineers in accordance with the equal work
the learned counsel would urge that a seniority list was also drawn up and an employment code was assigned to each one of the appellants from which fact the nature of their employment should be judged
an industrial dispute was raised by the appellants herein as their services were not being regularized by the respondent
if no then to which relief they are entitled and what directions should be given to the employer
3 and 4 are diploma holders in civil engineering
in this case except the nodal centre functions and supervision of the cooperative society the state has no administrative control over its day to day affairs
the said dispute was referred for adjudication of the labour court indore by the state of madhya pradesh on the following questions
it could not enlarge the scope of the reference nor could deviate therefrom
1whether non regularisation of the sub engineers as per the listed enclosed is valid and proper
rs 63 per day for the degree holders and rs 52 50 per day for the diploma holders
the state has not created any post nor they could do so on their own
the questions which have been raised before us by dr dhawan had not been raised before the labour court
dr dhawan would furthermore contend that the findings of fact had been arrived at by the labour court that the appellants of civil appeal no 337 of 2002 were appointed by the authority and not only their work was being taken in the project but also in other works and thus mere posting of the appellants to the said project would not disentitle them from the benefit of the said act
the matter relating to recruitment is governed by the 1973 act and the 1987 rules
a demand which was not raised at the time of raising the dispute could not have been gone into by the labour court being not the subject matter thereof
the labour court in absence of any pleadings or any proof as regard application of the 1961 act and the 1963 rules had proceeded on the basis that they would become permanent employees in terms of order 2ii and 2vi of the annexure appended thereto
in absence of any specific directions contained in the schedule appended to the standing orders the statute and the statutory rules applicable to the employees of the respondent shall prevail
the recruitments of the appellants do not fall in any of the said categories
the 1961 act itself shows that the employees are to be classified in six categories namely permanent permanent seasonal probationers badlies apprentices and temporary
as regard the claim of equal pay for equal work the learned counsel would urge that the high court has failed to consider the same in its true perspective
jt 2004 8 sc 531 2004 indlaw sc 729 a division bench of this court opined no person illegally appointed or appointed without following the procedure prescribed under the law is entitled to claim that he should be continued in service
the only provision as regard recruitment of the employees is contained in order 4 which merely provides that the manager shall within a period of six months lay down the procedure for recruitment of employees and notify it on the notice board on which standing orders are exhibited and shall send copy thereof to the labour commissioner
it was held that the services of the appellants can not be directed to be regularized in services
the 1973 act or the rules framed there under do not provide for appointments on ad hoc basis or on daily wages
they having come to learn that certain vacancies exist in the respondent authority applied therefor although no advertisement in that behalf was issued
in m p vidyut karamchari sangh vs m p electricity board 2004 9 scc 755 2004 indlaw sc 198 a three judge bench of this court held that a regulation which is not inconsistent with the provisions of the 1961 act and the rules can be issued by a statutory authority
jt 2004 6 sc 110 2004 indlaw sc 606 a three judge bench of this court of which we were members upon taking into consideration a large number of decisions held although we do not intend to express any opinion as to whether the cooperative society is a state within the meaning of article but it is beyond any cavil of doubt that the writ petition will be maintainable when the action of the cooperative society is violative of mandatory statutory provisions
the respondent authority appointed the appellants and posted them to an overseas project known as indore habitat project which was implemented through the agency of overseas development authority hereinafter referred to as the oda on daily wages
in this situation we see no reason to interfere with the impugned order
with a view to become eligible to be considered as a permanent employee or a temporary employee one must be appointed in terms thereof
