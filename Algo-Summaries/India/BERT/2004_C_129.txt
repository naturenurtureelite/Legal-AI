in response learned counsel for the respondent state submitted that the appellants have failed to adduce any evidence or material to show that were in any way induced by any governmental action to set up industries
no 1294 dated 24 10 1975 granted exemption from purchase tax on sugarcane in favour of sugar mills established in co operative and public sectors in the form of annual subsidy equivalent to purchase tax on sugarcane
there was no scope for any mis understanding that it applied to any private sector participation in the sphere of sugar manufacturing
in any event the retrospective withdrawal of the benefit on the basis of an executive decision is impermissible

of tamil nadu ors on 27 1 1984 and in c a 86052002 i e bannari amman sugars ltd v commercial tax officer
the appellants only made representation to government subsequently claiming exemption at par with the cooperative and public sector mills
as there was no inducement or assurance the question of any promissory estoppel did not arise
these two appeals involve identical questions and therefore are disposed of by this common judgment after noticing the factual position so far as they are relevant
the doctrines of promissory estoppel and legitimate expectation were applicable to the facts of the case
in support of the appeals the primary stands raised by the appellants are
in other words there was clear violation of the principles of natural justice
the doctrine of promissory estoppel has assumed importance in recent years though it was dimly noticed in some of the earlier cases
there was no material to show existence of any overriding public interest to rule out application of the aforesaid doctrine there was no scope for retrospective withdrawal
the appellants question correctness of the judgment rendered by a division bench of the madras high court which held that the withdrawal of benefits extended to the appellants as subsidy was in order
so far as legitimate expectation aspect is concerned it is too well known that the benefit extended can be withdrawn and with this knowledge if the units are set up the principle of legitimate expectation does not apply
the judgment forms subject matter of challenge in these appeals
the leading case on the subject is central london property trust ltd v high trees house ltd 1947 1 k b 130
a new class of estoppel has come to be recognized by the courts in this country as well as in england
the contents of the files which were produced before the high court and on which reliance was placed to hold against the appellants are not known to the appellants
in any event before withdrawal of the benefits no opportunity of hearing was granted
the appellants were taken by surprise by production of materials which were not even disclosed to the appellants
the appellants questioned legality or the g o ms no 989 dated 1 9 1988 directing discontinuance of purchase tax exemption in case of mills which exceeded the ceiling of rs 300 lakes during the period of five years and government letter dated 28 12 1988 which made the aforesaid g o ms no 989 of 1 9 1988 operative retrospectively from 1 4 1988
the high court erroneously came to hold that the state government had not filed any counter
where a particular mode is prescribed for doing an act and there is no impediment in adopting the procedure the deviation to act in different manner which does not disclose any discernible principle which is reasonable itself small be labelled as arbitrary
the materials which were produced before the high court and on the basis of which it is decided that the decision of the government is in order were not even pleaded in the pleadings and during arguments
letter to be valid reversing the conclusions arrived at by the tribunal
every state action must be informed by reason and it follows that an act uninformed by reason is per se arbitrary
estoppel is a rule of equity which has gained new dismensions in recent years
clause 1 does not prescribe how an executive action of the government is to be performed it only prescribes the mode under which such act is to be expressed
while clause 1 is in relation to the mode of expression clause 2 lays down the ways in which the order is to be authenticated
article 166 of the constitution deals with the conduct of government business

the rule laid down in high trees case supra again came up for consideration before the king s bench in combe v bombe 1951 2 k b 215
sometimes when the courts have intervened on policy grounds the court s view of the range of policies open under the statute or of what is unreasonable policy has not got public acceptance
sc 1823 1964 indlaw sc 103 held that the provisions of the article were only directory and not mandatory in character and if they were not complied with it could still be established as a question of fact that the impugned order was issued in fact by the state government or the governor
the high court recorded the following findings on the factual aspects

initially the writ petitions were filed before the high court but after constitution of the tamil nadu taxation special tribunal hereinafter referred to as the tribunal the writ petitions were transferred to the tribunal which held that on application of the principles of promissory estoppel and legitimate expectation the withdrawal of benefit was not sustainable in law
whether there is any government order in terms of article 166 has to be adjudicated from the factual background of each case
a basic and obvious test to apply in such cases is to see whether there is any discernible principle emerging from the impugned action and if so does if really satisfy the test of reasonableness
on the contrary curial views of policy have been subjected to stringent criticism
the state questioned correctness of the judgment before the high court which as noted above held the g o ms and the govt
the said provision reads as follows 166
sc 9011960 indlaw sc 472 shree meenakshi mills ltd v union of india air 1974
with reference to the files produced certain factual conclusions were arrived at the correctness of those form the core challenge in these appeals
this court s observations in g b mahajan v jalgaon municipal council air 1991 sc 1153 1990 indlaw sc 438 are kept out of lush field of administrative policy except where policy is inconsistent with the express or implied provision of a statute which creates the power to which the policy relates or where a decision made in purported exercise of power is such that a repository of the power acting reasonably and in good faith could not have made it
the courts are not very good at formulating or evaluating policy
in order to invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel clear sound and positive foundation must be laid in the petition itself by the party invoking and doctrine the bald expressions without any supporting material to the effect that the doctrine is attracted because the party invoking the doctrine has altered its position relying on the assurance of the government would not be sufficient to press into aid the doctrine

the expectation may arise either from a representation or promise made by the authority including an implied representation or from consistent past practice
v state of mysore and ors
the government has exercised their right to modify the scheme in the interest of public revenue
the stand taken by the present appellants before the tribunal and the high court was rejected
a person may have a legitimate expectation of being treated in a certain way by an administrative authority even though he has no legal right in private law to receive such treatment
the order granting subsidy can be withdrawn in public interest
its uniqueness lies in the fact that it covers the entire span of time present past and future
how significant is the statement that today is tomorrows yesterday
canalisation of a particular business in favour of even a specified individual is reasonable where the interests of the country are concerned or where the business affects the economy of the country
a claim based on merely legitimate expectation without anything more can not ipso facto give a right
the present is as we experience it the past is a present memory and future is a present expectation
the courts are bound to consider all aspects including the results sought to be achieved and the public good at large because while considering the applicability of the doctrine the courts have to do equity and the fundamental principles of equity must for ever be present in the mind of the court
the legitimate substantive expectation merely permits the court to find out if the change of policy which is the cause for defeating the legitimate expectation is irrational or perverse or one which no reasonable person could have made
conduct of business of the government of a state 1 all executive action of the government of a state shall be expressed to be taken in the name of the governor
the doctrine of legitimate expectation has an important place in the developing law of judicial review
that is and ought to be a difficult onus for an applicant to discharge
in determining whether there is any unfairness involved the nature of the right alleged to have taken infringed the underlying purpose of the restriction imposed the extent and urgency of the evil sought to be remedied thereby the disproportion of the imposition the prevailing condition at the relevant time enter into judicial verdict the reasonableness of the legitimate expectation has to be determined with respect to the circumstances relating to the trade or business in question
no prejudice is caused to the respondents since the scheme was interested to make the units viable and the modified scheme provides for safeguards to that extent
but there has to be a word of caution
