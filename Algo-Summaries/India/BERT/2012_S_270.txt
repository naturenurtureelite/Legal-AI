this was done in the presence of lw 10 and lw 11shaik ibrahim and mohd ghouse respectively
the fir was registered under section 304b and section 498a of the indian penal code1860 for short the ipc thereafter investigation was conducted by one shri p devadass lw 17 he inspected the site from where he recovered and seized the saree that had been used for hanging
thereupon the body was sent for postmortem examination through constable p venkateswara reddy lw 15 lw 17p devdass also took photographs of the scene 3 lw 13dr
m madhusudana reddy conducted autopsy over the body of the deceased and prepared post mortem certificate giving the cause of death as asphyxia as a result of hanging
lw 1lodged the report which was registered by sri k srinivasarao lw 16the sub inspector of police
on 16th february2003at about 5 p m
the father of the deceased pathan yasin khan lw 1 and her mother pathan shamshad begum lw 2 were present at that time
investigating officer arrested all the three accused persons
they faced the trial and were convicted by learned sixth additional munsif magistrate guntur for committing an offence under sections 498a and 304b ipc
they were committed to the court of sessions guntur division guntur for such an offence
accused pathan hussain basha was married to pathan haseena begum now deceased on 23rd june2002 at guntur
they even refused to send her to her parental house
it is the case of the prosecution that for non payment of dowry the accused persons harassed the deceased and subjected her to cruelty
however upon medical examination by the doctor she was declared brought dead
this witness has further specifically stated that the said accused treated his daughter in a proper manner for about two months
this was informed by the deceased to various persons including her relatives and elders
it was an arranged marriage
they faced the trial and the learned sessions judge vide its judgment dated 4th october2004 found them guilty of the said offences and punished them as follows hence a 1 to a 3 are sentenced to undergo r i for three years and further sentenced to pay a fine of rs 1000 each total fine amount rs 3000 offence punishable u s 498 a ipc i d of the fine amount of rs 1000 to undergo si for 9 months
despite such pressure she was not able to get that money from her family
in the marriage he had also given a gold chain a double bed an iron safe and other items
he had given only rs 15000 and had agreed to pay rs 10000 after four months
when the parents of the deceased came to the house of the accused and found the deceased hanging from the beam with a saree they untied her and took her to the government general hospital guntur hoping that the deceased may be alive
she was unable to bear the cruelty to which she was subjected by the accused persons
subsequently lw 3 pathan basheerunnisa sent her grandson pathan inayatullah khan lw 4 to the house of the parents of the deceased to inform them about the incident
at the time of marriage it was promised that a dowry of rs 25000 besides other formalities would be paid by the side of the wife to the husband
on 15th february2003at about 11 a m the deceased committed suicide by hanging herself in the house of the accused
the explanation to this section requires that the expression dowry shall have the same meaning as in s 2 of the act
when pathan basheerunnisa lw3 returned from her work the accused sent her out giving her money to bring the soaps upon which she went out and when she came back she found the accused absent and the bride hanging in the house
the accused pathan hussain basha his father pathan khadar basha and mother pathan nazeer abi forced her to get the balance amount of dowry
12 the definition of dowry under s 2 of the act reads as under 2 definition of dowry
according to this witness on 23rd january2002the marriage of his daughter was solemnised with accused pathan hussain basha and he had accepted to give rs 25000 in marriage
by a deeming fiction in law the onus shifts on to the accused to prove as to how the deceased died
it is for the accused to show that the death of the deceased did not result from any cruelty or demand of dowry by the accused persons
it is of some significance that these expressions should be given appropriate meaning to avoid undue harassment or advantage to either of the parties
similarlyin connection with the marriage is an expression which has to be given a wider connotation
he had called his son in law accused no 1to his house as per custom at that point the accused demanded a ceiling fan
these amendments appear to have been made with the intention to cover all demands at the time before and even after the marriage so far they were in connection with the marriage of the said parties
applying these principles to the facts of the present case it is clear that the ingredients of section 304b read with section 498a ipc are completely satisfied in the present case
and further a 1 to a 3 are sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life for the offence u s 304 b ipc both the sentences shall run concurrently
the expression demand for dowry will have to be construed ejusdem generis to the word immediately preceding this expression
out of this amount a sum of rs 15000 was paid at that time and it was promised that the balance dowry of rs 10000 would be paid in the month of october2002upon which the marriage was performed
the accused did not care to explain as to how the death of his wife occurred
secondly that soon before her death she had been subjected to cruelty or harassment by the husband or any of the relatives of the husband for or in connection with any demand for dowry then such a death shall be called dowry death and the husband or the relative as the case may be will be deemed to have caused such a death
this clearly shows the intent of the legislature that these expressions are of wide meaning and scope
the father of the bride could not pay the balance amount within time because he lacked the resources
these are penal provisions but ultimately these are the social legislations intended to control offences relating to the society as a whole
the cruelty and harassment by the husband or any relative could be directly relatable to or in connection with any demand for dowry
accused were charged with offences under sections 498a and 304b of the ipc the fir in the present case was lodged by lw 1who is the father of the deceased
in this actdowry means any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly a by one party to a marriage to the other party to the marriage or b by the parents of either party to a marriage or by any other person to either party to the marriage or to any other person at or before or any time after the marriage in connection with the marriage of the said parties but does not include dower or mahr in the case of persons to whom the muslim personal law shariat applies
the expressions or any time after marriage and in connection with the marriage of the said parties were introduced by the amending act 63 of 1984 and act 43 of 1986 with effect from 2 101985 and 19 11 1986 respectively
denial can not be treated to be the discharge of onus
these matters of course will have to be examined on the facts and circumstances of a given case
they were married in the year 2002 and she committed suicide by hanging on 15th
such a presumption can be drawn by the court keeping in view the evidence produced by the prosecution in support of the substantive charge under section 304 b of the code
this gave rise to filing of the present appeals
first and the foremost we must consider what is the evidence led by the prosecution to bring home the guilt of accused
the period intervening between the marriage and the death of the deceased is very small
the sentence awarded by the trial court was confirmed
the courts have also taken the view that where the husband had demanded a specific sum from his father in law and upon not being given harassed and tortured the wife and after some days she died such cases would clearly fall within the definition of dowry under the act
s 4 of the act is the penal section and demanding a dowryas defined under s 2 of the act is punishable under this section
