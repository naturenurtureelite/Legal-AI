the ipab in the impugned order held that the trade mark nos 475269475267 and 484837 have not been used by the appellant for more than a period of five years and one month and the appellant also failed to make out that it had been in manufacturing or trading of the goods for which it had taken registration nos 475269475267 and 484837 consequently the ipab allowed the applications made by the first respondent purportedly under section 461b of the 1958 act and directed the registrar to remove these registrations from the register.

learned counsel submitted that the fact that the appellant continues to allege and that stance has not changed in the pleadings in slp as well that the first respondent is an infringer pilfriger defrauder someone who wants to ride on the goodwill of the appellant or someone who wants to mislead the public at large there is no question of the first respondent ceasing to be a person aggrieved at any stage.
