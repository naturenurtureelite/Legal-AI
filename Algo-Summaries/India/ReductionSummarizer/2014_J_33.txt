the grievance of the appellant state is that the high court while passing the impugned order has not noticed the liability incurred by the undertaking and the loan paid to the company.
till date there has not been a single determination adjudication by any court authority of any dues against the company nor is there any claim pending before any authority or before any court on date.
the high court by the impugned judgment dated 1st march2011though noticed the aforesaid facts including the fact that the collector tulsi gaur by order dated 20th february1992 held that there were dues of about rs 10 44 crores payable by the company part of which can be adjusted from the compensation amount paid by the meerut development authority even thereafter an amount of rs 6 09 crores will remain payable by the company but the high court failed to address such issue.
the high court though noticed that s 8 of the u p state sugar undertakings acquisition act1971 empowers the prescribed authority to decide any dispute regarding the amount payable to any person or authority in respect of earlier liabilities of the undertaking but it wrongly held that in view of the provisions of the u p sugar undertakings acquisition act1971.
the order dated 20th february1992 passed by the collector was also not under challenge inspite of the same the high court declared the order dated 20th february1992 as illegal.
the matter is remitted to the district collector meerut to determine the liability of the company upto the date of vesting i e 28th october1984 after notice to the parties.
after determination of liabilities and adjustment of the dues which is payable by the company if any amount is found payable to the company the appellant shall pay the amount within four months from the date of determination.
after giving credit of rs 4 33 crores payable by the state government on account of amounts towards compensation for acquisition of land the liability of the company was determined at rs 6 09 crores on 20th february1992 a sale proclamation was accordingly issued.
