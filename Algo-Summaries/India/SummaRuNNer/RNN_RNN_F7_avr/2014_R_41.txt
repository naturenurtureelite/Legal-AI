in any case the period between the arrest and the identification parade was not large enough to constitute inordinate delay.
the identification parades belong to the investigation stage.
they are generally held during the course of investigation with the primary object of enabling the witnesses to identify persons concerned in the offence who were not previously known to them.
it is for this reason that the identification parades in this case seem to have been held under the supervision of a magistrate.
this serves to satisfy the investigating officers of the bona fides of the prosecution witnesses and also to furnish evidence to corroborate their testimony in court.
they must therefore take intelligent interest in the proceedings bearing in mind two considerations i that the life and liberty of an accused may depend on their vigilance and caution and ii that justice should be done in the identification.
the purpose of a prior test identification therefore seems to be to test and strengthen the trustworthiness of that evidence.
generally speaking the magistrate must make a note of every objection raised by an accused at the time of identification and the steps taken by them to ensure fairness to the accused so that the court which is to judge the value of the identification evidence may take them into consideration in the appreciation of that evidence.

the accused devendra kumar was arrested on 22 12 2003 and his identification parade was conducted on 26 12 2003 within four days there is no evidence on record to show that the child witness had an opportunity to see and study the features of the accused between their arrest and test identification parade to enable a tutored identification.
these parades are of the essentially governed by section 162criminal procedure code.
having regard to the role attributed to him and the absence of incriminating factors we find that it is not safe to convict mahesh of the offence of murder with the aid of ss 34 and 120b.
on a careful conspectus of the facts and the law we are of the view that the prosecution has failed to prove the guilt of mahesh beyond reasonable doubt.
the persons required to identify an accused should have had no opportunity of seeing him after the commission of the crime and before identification and secondly that no mistakes are made by them or the mistakes made are negligible.
keeping in view the purpose of identification parades the magistrates holding them are expected to take all possible precautions to eliminate any suspicion of unfairness and to reduce the chance of testimonial error.

mahesh did not even act as a guard he did not prevent anil kumar pw 21 from entering the house.
the power to identify it may be kept in view varies according to the power of observation and memory of the person identifying and each case depends on its own facts but there are two factors which seem to be of basic importance in the evaluation of identification.
those proceeding should not make it impossible for the identifiers who after all have as a rule only fleeting glimpses of the person they are supposed to identify.

the evidence of mere identification of the accused person at the trial for the first time is from its very nature inherently of a weak character.
as a general rule the substantive evidence of a witness is a statement made in court.
the evidence in order to carry conviction should ordinarily clarify as to how and under what circumstances he came to pick out the particular accused person and the details of the part which the accused played in the crime in question with reasonable particularity.
it is accordingly considered a safe rule of prudence to generally look for corroboration of the sworn testimony of witnesses in court as to the identity of the accused who are strangers to them in the form of earlier identification proceeding.
we therefore hold that the accused mahesh accused no 3 in criminal appeal no 867 of 2013 is innocent and the conviction against him is set aside.
the identification to be of value should also be held without much delay.
mahesh and chandra prakash were arrested on 29 11 2003their identification parade was conducted on 13 12 2003 within a fortnight or so.

they do not constitute substantive evidence.
it was submitted that the test identification parade were delayed and the identification of these accused by the witness in court was not reliable.
the number of persons mixed up with the accused should be reasonably large and their bearing and general appearance not glaringly dissimilar.
he was merely seen by the witness as standing outside the house when the witness came home.
merely because he has been some time in the company of the police at the police station his testimony can not be discarded as untrue.
there is no evidence of his having played any part in the crime.
