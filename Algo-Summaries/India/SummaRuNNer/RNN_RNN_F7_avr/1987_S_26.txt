this court in hari shankar v rao girdhari lal chowdhury1962 1 suppl.
in order to decide this question it is necessary to decide the scope and ambit of section 292 of the rent act.
we may mention that in gundalapalli rangamannar chetty v desu rangiah and others a i r 1954.
this view is now concluded by the decision of this court in madras bangalore transport co west v inder singh and others1986 3 s c c 62 1986.
for this proposition see the decision of the gujarat high court in the case of mehta jagjivan vanechand v doshi vanechand harakhchand and others.
in the instant case judged by the aforesaid principles it is possible to hold that there was a partnership of which the appellant was a partner.
lastly such a decision does not lead to a miscarriage of justice.
it is true that in the partnership deeds the bank accounts were not to be operated by the appellant and further that irrespective of the profit.
this principle was reiterated in krishnawati v hans raj1974 2 s c r 524 1973 indlaw sc 208 which was dealing with section 392 of the delhi rent control act1958 in second appeal.
this view had also been expressed in the decision of this court in puranchand v motilal1963.

it is well settled that if there was such a partnership firm of which the appellant was a partner as a tenant the same would not amount to subletting leading to the forfeiture of the tenancy.
the expression according to law in section 35 of the said act referred to the decision as a whole and was not to be equated to errors of law or of fact simpliciter.
the partnership deeds were there the appellant was not to share in the losses.
the partnership deeds were there entitling the petitioner to share in the partnership.
the high court on a reappraisal of these very evidence came to the conclusion that the partnerships were camouflages and were not acted upon and in fact and in reality the partnership firm was a sub tenant of the appellant herein.
weaving works and according to the terms of tenancy suit premises were leased for manufacturing cloth in the name of ahmedabad fine.
the court of small causes came to the conclusion on an analysis of the evidence before it and the terms of the three partnership deeds referred to hereinbefore that there was a genuine partnership in law which was acted upon.
hereinafter called the rent act is the question involved in this appeal by special leave from the judgment and order of the high court of gujarat dated 21st of august1979.
the appellant was to bring his asset being the tenancy of the premises in question for the user of the partnership.
the respondent had alleged in the two suits that the appellant was his tenant in the suit premises which were leased out to him and before him his father for conducting the business in the name of ahmedabad fine.
it was the case of the appellant that in respect of the suit premises he was carrying on his business with respondents.
the authority vested in the high court under the amendment still remained only in the domain of the jurisdiction and power of revision and no further.
the amending provision therefore only related to procedure and not to any rights of the parties.
whether there was a partnership or not may in certain cases be a mixed question of law and fact in the sense that whether the ingredients of partnership as embodied in the law of partnership were there in a particular case or not must be judged in the light of the principles applicable to partnership.
a i r 1972 gujarat 6 1970 indlaw guj 68 thakkar j of the gujarat high court as the learned judge then was held that the mere fact that a tenant entered into a partnership and allowed the premises being used for the benefit of partnership does not constitute assignment or subletting in favour of the partnership firm entitling a landlord to recover possession.
we must however guard ourselves against permitting in the guise of revision substitution of one view where two views are possible and the court of small causes has taken a particular view.
it is true that since after 4th of october1960 the partnership firm was carrying on business in the premises in question.
the agreement must be to share profits of business and 3 the business must be carried on by all or any of the persons concerned acting for all.
that in the partnership deed which is not necessary to recite the terms the petitioner was completely excluded in operating the bank accounts etc.
the appellant herein is entitled to the costs throughout.
the clause of the partnership deed provided that there should be a fixed percentage of profit to be given to the partner appellant no 1 the appellant was not to share the losses.
this view was reiterated by chief justice beaumont in chimanram motilal and another v jayantilal chhaganlal and another a i r 1939 bombay 410 1939 indlaw mum 155 ramaswami j in mohammed musa sahib dead and others v n k mohammed ghouse sahib and another a i r 1959.
as we read the power the high court must ensure that the principles of law have been correctly borne in mind.
we must take note of a decision in the case of m s kasturbhai ramchand panchal brothers and others v firm of mohanlal nathubhai and others air 1969 gujarat 110 1967 indlaw guj 57upon which the high court had placed great reliance in the judgment under appeal.
it is evident from the sales tax registration and other registration certificates and licences under the shops and establishments act that the partnership was registered in the name of the appellant and the appellant was also indicated as a partner.
if a possible view has been taken the high court would be exceeding its jurisdiction to substitute its own view with that the courts below because it considers it to be a better view.
in this the appellant was not a partner.
we are further of the opinion that the court of small causes was right in the view it took.
the high court in revision reversed that finding.
he also referred to section 4 of the partnership act about the principles of partnership namely1 there must be agreement entered into by all the persons concerned 2 the agreement must be to share the profits of a business and 3 the business must be carried on by all or any of the persons concerned acting for all.
the appellant claimed to be the tenant in respect of the two premises which are quite adjacent to each other one of which is involved in this appeal.
and it was a possible view to take.
there was nothing intrinsically wrong in law in constituting a partnership in the manner it was done.
in the eye of law such a clause is really non sequitur or neutral proving neither the existence nor non existence of a genuine firm.
the respondent had further alleged that the appellant no 1 had closed the business and he was not using the said premises for the purpose for which it was let to him.
it must be such a decision which no reasonable man could have arrived at.
there was evidence of suit of dissolution of the partnership where none of the partners took the plea that it was a false or a fictitious document.
the fact that the high court would have taken a different view is wholly irrelevant.
the trial court in the instant appeal held that there was subletting.
this is also not inconsistent with treating the rent of the firm in the context of the total expenditure of the firm.
the respondent is the landlord of the two premises and these were situated at raikhad ward ahmedabad.
if that was so there was nothing that could be clone about such a view within the ambit and scope of the power of section 292 of the rent act.
the revisional authority could ensure that there was no miscarriage of justice and the principles of law have been correctly borne in mind the facts had been properly comprehended in that light.
